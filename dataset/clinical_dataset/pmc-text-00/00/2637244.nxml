However, no licensed vaccines or effective treatments are yet available for human use. Naked DNA vaccines are an interesting approach since the virus is highly infectious and existing attenuated Rift Valley Fever virus vaccine strains display adverse effects in animal trials. In this study, gene-gun immunisations with cDNA encoding structural proteins of the Rift Valley Fever virus were evaluated in mice. The induced immune responses were analysed for the ability to protect mice against virus challenge.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Immunisation with cDNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein induced strong humoral and lymphocyte proliferative immune responses, and virus neutralising antibodies were acquired after vaccination with cDNA encoding the glycoproteins. Even though complete protection was not achieved by genetic immunisation, four out of eight, and five out of eight mice vaccinated with cDNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein or the glycoproteins, respectively, displayed no clinical signs of infection after challenge. In contrast, all fourteen control animals displayed clinical manifestations of Rift Valley Fever after challenge.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The appearance of Rift Valley Fever associated clinical signs were significantly decreased among the DNA vaccinated mice and further adjustment of this strategy may result in full protection against Rift Valley Fever.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne <italic>Phlebovirus </italic>in the <italic>Bunyaviridae </italic>family. RVFV infects domesticated ruminants and humans and regularly induces epizootics with concomitant epidemics throughout the African continent and on the Arabian Peninsula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Outbreaks among domesticated ruminants are characterised by a large increase of spontaneous abortions and the case fatality rate may reach 100% in young animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. While Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is generally benign in man, more severe clinical manifestations such as hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis and retinitis are regulary observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Despite the fact that RVF is an important viral zoonosis, and the risk for emergence in new susceptible areas has been emphasized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], effective and safe vaccines are not commercially available. However, formalin inactivated vaccines have been developed for human use, but the distribution is limited to high-risk occupation staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Currently there are a few vaccines available for use in livestock: vaccines based on the live-attenuated Smithburn strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and formalin inactivated virus preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The Smithburn virus vaccine is suggested to induce lifelong protection, but has retained the ability to induce abortions and teratogenic effects in livestock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The inactivated virus vaccines are safe, but less immunogenic and require annual booster vaccinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Previously, two vaccine candidates have been proposed and tested for their safety and efficacy in animal trials: a naturally attenuated RVFV isolate from a benign human case in the Central African Republic, Clone 13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and a human virus isolate of RVFV attenuated in cell culture by 5-fluorouracil treatment, MP12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although Clone 13 and MP12 were shown to be safe and immunogenic in mice and in cattle and sheep, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the MP12 vaccine was found teratogenic for pregnant sheep if used during the first trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the adverse effects previously shown for attenuated RVF vaccines, there are considerable safety concerns regarding viral vaccines based on highly pathogenic organisms due to the risk for exposure or escape of live agents during the manufacturing process. In addition, there is also a risk of insufficient inactivation or emergence of revertants, when large quantities of virulent virus strains are handled. Because of these shortcomings, new RVF vaccine strategies ought to be considered. Genetic immunisation is an attractive alternative, since the antigens are produced by the host cells and the presentation resembles natural infections by intracellular parasites. It is also cost-effective and circumvents the need for elevated biosafety level facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Genetic vaccines are also less vulnerable to elevated temperatures during storage and transportation, which are important factors when performing vaccinations in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These characteristics make DNA vaccines uniquely suited for vaccine production against highly pathogenic organisms, such as RVFV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The RVFV is a three segmented negative stranded RNA virus. The (L)arge segment encodes a RNA dependent RNA polymerase and the (M)edium segment encodes two glycoproteins (G<sub>N </sub>and G<sub>C</sub>), a 78 kDa protein as well as a non-structural protein (NSm). The (S)mall segment encodes a non-structural protein (NSs) and the immunogenic and highly expressed nucleocapsid protein (N) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Despite an abundance of the N protein in the virus and in the infected cell, this protein is not generally associated with protective immunity. However, a recent study has shown that a proportion of mice inoculated with purified RVFV N proteins were protected against virus challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although antibodies targeting the RVFV glycoproteins are recognized for their protective properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] contradictory results regarding the level of protection after DNA vaccination have been presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In this study we evaluate the induced immune responses and the conferred protection in mice after genetic immunisation with cDNA encoding the structural proteins of RVFV. The elicited immune responses towards the N, G<sub>N</sub>, G<sub>C </sub>and G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C </sub>proteins after gene-gun immunisation were analysed and the protective abilities of the N and the G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C </sub>construct were tested by virus challenge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>BHK-21 (ATCC number CCL-10) cells were maintained in Glasgow MEM (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% FCS, 1.3 g/l Tryptose (Difco&#x02122;, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD), 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U penicillin/ml and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin at 37&#x000b0;C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Before immunisation the mice were thoroughly shaved on the abdomen and vaccinated with cDNA encoding the antigens using a gene-gun (Helios&#x02122;, BioRad Laboratories). The cDNA was administrated four times with two to three week intervals. The primary immunisation was performed using four gene-gun cartridges and the following three boosters with two cartridges. Blood samples were collected three, five, seven and nine weeks after the primary immunisation. In order to study the immune responses post infection (p.i.) and the effectiveness of the genetic vaccines, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with RVFV diluted in sterile PBS to a final volume of 100 &#x003bc;l. Infected animals were kept in micro-isolator cages inside an animal isolator (Bell Isolation Systems Ltd, Livingston, Scotland) and all manipulations involving infected animals or viable virus were performed within a BSL-3 laboratory. During the experimental procedures the animals were monitored daily and were kept with free access to food and water. Mice found in a moribund condition (fatigue and "hunchback-like posture") were instantly euthanized. This project was approved by The Animal Research Ethics Committee of Ume&#x000e5; University, Sweden.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of immune response</title><p>To evaluate and compare the immune responses after vaccination and infection, eight animals were vaccinated with cDNA encoding N, four with cDNA containing the open reading frame of the G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C </sub>poly-protein and two groups, each containing four animals, were immunised with either the G<sub>N </sub>or the G<sub>C </sub>construct. To analyse the immune responses after infection, one group consisting of nine mice were infected with 2.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>PFU of RVFV. At day 14 p.i. the animals were euthanized and samples collected.

In the groups of mice immunised with the N or the G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C </sub>constructs, four of eight and five of eight animals, respectively, displayed no clinical signs during the entire experiment (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Despite the large proportion of animals without RVF clinical signs in the G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C </sub>vaccination group, extensive viral replication after infection was indicated by high N specific antibody titers, similar to the titers observed for the control animals (data not shown). Apart from one casualty, due to a moribund condition, in the N vaccinated group, no major differences in the severity of the clinical manifestations were observed between the G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C </sub>and N vaccinated mice after challenge. In contrast, all animals in the two control groups displayed either clinical signs of infection followed by complete recovery (12/14) or were sacrificed due to a moribund condition (2/14) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Significant protection against RVF clinical signs was observed among the N vaccinated mice (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0096, Fisher exact test) and the G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C </sub>vaccinated mice (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0021, Fisher exact test) as compared to the controls.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>RVF is an important emerging zoonotic infection and early efforts to protect animals and humans resulted in development of attenuated and inactivated virus vaccines. Vaccines based on live attenuated RVFV strains have shown to induce long-lasting protection in contrast to inactivated virus vaccines, which require multiple booster doses to retain a protective immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Unfortunately, teratogenic effects and the ability to cause abortions limit the likelihood for wide use and distribution of the current vaccines based on attenuated RVFV strains. As the existing vaccines have such shortcomings, efforts to design safer and more efficient RVF vaccines need to be undertaken.</p><p>We have investigated the prospect of employing genetic immunisation against RVF. The DNA vaccine platform has been extensively studied during the last decade. However, the breakthrough has been on halt until recently when the first licensed products became available, such as the vaccine against West Nile virus infection in horses and a vaccine for use in salmon against the hematopoietic necrosis virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The DNA vaccine technology is especially suitable against pathogens such as RVFV, since the need of elevated biosafety facilities are circumvented and the stability of these vaccines allow distribution in developing countries lacking the logistics to maintain a "cold-chain".</p><p>In this study, the immune responses in mice after genetic immunisation with RVFV cDNA encoding the N protein, the glycopolyprotein G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C</sub>, and the separate G<sub>C </sub>and G<sub>N </sub>proteins were analysed. The N and the G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C </sub>constructs displayed the most promising results regarding the elicited immune response and were evaluated further for the ability to confer protection in a subsequent challenge study.</p><p>After gene-gun vaccination with the N construct, high antibody titers were repeatedly induced along with an antigen induced proliferative cellular response. Interestingly, no clinical signs were observed after challenge in 50% of the animals (compared to 100% in the control group) despite the lack of detectable levels of neutralising antibodies after vaccination. The observed protection might be explained by cell-mediated immune factors as indicated by the dose-dependent proliferation of spleen cells from the immunised animals. Nevertheless, the characteristics of the proliferating cells remain to be investigated further. Analogous results were previously found after vaccination with the purified RVFV N protein when protection was obtained in 60% of the vaccinated mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Also, a recent study using the Toscana virus (<italic>Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae</italic>) reported approximately 60% survival upon challenge after immunisation with the recombinant N protein, probably due to a cellular mediated immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies of N proteins of Hantaviruses revealed that strong B-cells epitopes are located near the amino-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, this does not seem to be the case for RVFV N. Genetic immunisations are in general believed to mimic the natural presentation of antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but interestingly, while the sera of immunised mice recognized the amino-terminal part (aa 1&#x02013;100) of the N-protein, sera of the infected animals did not. The lack of reactivity towards the central (N2) and the C-terminal (N3) parts could either be explained by a distorted conformation of the encoded antigens or disruption of epitope-regions within the N protein.</p><p>In this study, antibodies towards the glycoproteins were induced after genetic vaccination, but virus neutralisation was only observed in sera of mice immunised with cDNA containing the G<sub>N </sub>gene. This observation is in accordance with earlier findings, where G<sub>N </sub>has been shown to possess antigenic determinants important for protection, while G<sub>C </sub>does not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. However Besselar and co-workers found neutralising epitopes associated with protection in the G<sub>C</sub>, as well as in the G<sub>N </sub>protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The absence of neutralising antibodies after gene-gun vaccination using the G<sub>C </sub>construct alone might be explained by incorrect folding of the expressed antigen, since neutralising antibodies elicited by the glycoproteins are often found to be conformation dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>The RVFV glycoproteins have been used in several protection studies, utilizing different vaccination strategies and animal models. The protective effect varied from no/low to complete protection depending on the administration strategy, antigen and animal model used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In this study, the majority of the G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C </sub>vaccinated mice were protected against RVF. However, the incomplete protection found was unexpected as a similar study, using analogous G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C </sub>constructs (RVFV<sub>-NSm</sub>), reported complete protection of mice after challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. On the other hand, intramuscular inoculation of cDNA encoding the G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C </sub>polyprotein did not induce neutralising antibodies and did not protect against RVFV challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent study reported that dual expression of the N and the G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C </sub>proteins may generate RVF Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and the formation of VLPs after genetic immunisation is hypothesised to be the reason for the high virus neutralising antibody titers induced by the genetic West Nile virus vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Perhaps, by using a similar approach, and introducing cDNA encoding the N and the G<sub>N</sub>/G<sub>C </sub>proteins of RVFV, a fully protective immune response might be induced.</p><p>In summary, while DNA vaccination against RVF induced strong humoral and proliferative immune responses in vaccinated mice, complete protection after challenge was not achieved. Nevertheless, naked DNA vaccines may constitute a promising strategy for vaccine development and this study provides insight for the basis of a future development of an efficacious DNA vaccine against RVF.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>NL made the cDNA constructs, carried out the serological assays, analysed the data and wrote the manuscript.
