Development of predictive algorithms basedon sequence profile requires a very large number of experimental binding peptide data to major histocompatibility complex(MHC) molecules. Here we used inverse folding approach to study the peptide specificity of MHC Class-I molecule with the aimof obtaining a better differentiation between binding and nonbinding sequence. Overlapping peptides, spanning the entireprotein sequence, are threaded through the backbone coordinates of a known peptide fold in the MHC groove, and theirinteraction energies are evaluated using statistical pairwise contact potentials. We used the Miyazawa &#x00026; Jernigan andBetancourt &#x00026; Thirumalai tables for pairwise contact potentials, and two distance criteria(Nearest atom &#x0226b; 4.0 &#x0212b; &#x00026; C-beta &#x0226b; 7.0 &#x0212b;)for ranking the peptides in an ascending order according to their energy values, and in most cases, known antigenic peptides are highlyranked. The predictions from threading improved when used multiple templates and average scoring scheme. In general, when structuralinformation about a protein-peptide complex is available, the current application of the threading approach can be used to screen alarge library of peptides for selection of the best binders to the target protein. The proposed scheme may significantly reduce thenumber of peptides to be tested in wet laboratory for epitope based vaccine design.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>epitope</kwd><kwd>MHC</kwd><kwd>threading</kwd><kwd>template</kwd><kwd>contact potential</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="ABB"><title>Abbreviations</title><p> CTL - cytotoxic T lymphocytes, MHC - major histocompatibility complex , MJ - Miyazawa and Jernigan , BT - Betancourt and Thirumalai, PDB - Protein databank, MPID - MHC peptide interaction database.</p></sec><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Development of epitope-based vaccines critically requires identification of regions in non-self and mutated proteinswhich are recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTLs). The recognition of such regions by CTLs is a multistepprocesses where binding of peptides to MHC class I molecule is an important step and further transport ofpeptide&#x02013;MHC complex to the antigen presenting cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>]. Much of the information has accumulated regarding the specific binding of peptides to MHC class I molecules. A number of computational methods have been developed for the prediction of MHC binding peptide according to the data and computational approaches they apply i.e. sequence and structure based. Sequence based approaches includes motif, quantitative matrix and machine learning models have been successful applied in the discovery of novel T-cell epitopes involved in the cancer immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>] . Although sequence based approaches are well established, but they require large sets of peptides that were tested experimentally and not feasible in situations where insufficient experimental binding dataare available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>]. Availability of crystallographically solved MHC-peptide complexes provides the opportunities for inverse folding (threading) approach which do not rely on previously binding data but aim to take account of the contributions of individual amino acids along the peptide that prompt them to fit into the groove of MHC allele using structural considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, an approach developed to address the inverse protein folding problem is applied to prediction of potentialbinding peptides to a specific MHC molecule and their interaction energies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref>] are evaluated using statistical pairwise contact potentials, MJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] and BT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>].The number of conformations the peptide can adopt in the binding groove islimited and defined by the peptide-MHC structure that imposes physical constraints on the peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. The residues were considered to be in contact or not according to two different distance criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. We also investigated whether using multiple template structures and taking the average improves the predictions or not. After these analysis, we found that using BT potential with any two atoms are closer than 4 &#x0212b; and taking multiple peptide conformations into consideration improves the threading procedure in discriminating between binding and nonbinding peptides. Hence, thecompatibility of the peptide sequence with the space in the binding groove has an important role in molecular recognition which implies that the peptide conformation should be taken into consideration to improve the predictions of threading methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Template structures</title><p>The available data in the PDB are redundant and hence we created a non-redundant set from those entries with the bestresolution for the related structural complexes having identical sequence information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. The non-redundant dataset consists of fifty four class I MHC-Peptidecomplexes (Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary material</xref>). All the complexes chosen for the study were characterized using IMGT/3Dstructure-DB Structural Query tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] andMHC-Peptide Interaction Database (MPID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] including eleven 8-mer peptide-H2-Kb, seventeen 9-mer peptide-HLA-A*0201, twelve 9-mer peptide-H2-Db, four 10-mer peptide-HLA-A*0201 complexes. The MHC non-bindingpeptide data set for the selected alleles were retrieved from AntiJen database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>],which covered a large range of IC<sub>50</sub> value from 5000-440000 (Table 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementarymaterial</xref>). The interface of peptide&#x02013;MHC complexes is defined using the parameters, Interface Area and Gap Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Interface area for class I MHC-peptide complexes was defined as the change in their solvent accessible surface area (delta ASA) when going from a monomeric MHC molecule to a dimeric MHC-peptidecomplex state whereas, Gap index is used as means to evaluate the complementarity of interacting surfaces. Thegap index is calculated using the formula, Gap Index = Gap Volume / delta ASA.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Threading with a contact potential matrix</title><p>In this method, binding affinity of a peptide is predicted by the total energy of interaction with contact residues. The contacts of the peptide in the available template co-crystal structure are determined according to two different criteria 1), &#x003b2;-carbon atoms are closer than 7 &#x0212b; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>] and 2) any two atoms are closer than 4 &#x0212b; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Then, the amino-acid sequence of the query peptide is threaded onto the coordinates of the peptide in the template using MODPROPEP web server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. The contacts are assumed to be conserved, and the total interaction energy is obtained by summing the interaction energy values of peptide residues using a contact potential matrix. The contacting residues are determined for the conformation in the known structure, and therefore are only approximate for different sequences threaded. Energy values for amino acid-to-amino acid interactions are taken from the table of statistical pairwise contact potentials derived by MJ and BT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The experimental binding energies are correlated with binding affinity (IC<sub>50</sub>) using the expression, <italic>&#x00394;G</italic>exp = <italic>-RT</italic> ln(IC<sub>50</sub>) where R is the gas constant and T the absolute temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. The predicted contact energies are given in dimensionless units of RT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>The peptide sequences in the test dataset (Table 1 and 2, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary material</xref>) were threaded onto the crystalstructures of the MHC class I peptide complexes. Different statistical potential matrices (MJ &#x00026; BT) were used to obtain anestimate of the binding affinity of the threaded sequences, with the goal of ranking the binding and nonbinding sequences in the selected data set (see Methodology). We applied the method of Altuvia and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] to score and rank the binding affinities of peptides to MHC class I molecules. Table 3 and 4(under <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary material</xref>)gives the ranking of peptides according to the binding affinities predicted by MJ and BT threading algorithm and using the 1VAC, 1LEG (H2-Kb/8); 1INQ, 1JPG (H2-Db/9); 1HHI, 1AO7 (HLA-A*0201/9); 1I4F,2CLR (HLA-A*0201/10) complex structure as the template for two different distance criteria (Nearest atom &#x0226b; 4.0 &#x0212b; &#x00026; C-beta &#x0226b;7.0 &#x0212b;) to define the contacting residues. Although it is reasonable to use the same distance criterion as in theparameterization of the statistical contact potentials, we have applied both distance criteria to enable a direct comparison ofthe results.</p><p>Here, we found that the nearest atom &#x0226b; 4.0 &#x0212b; distances criterion to determine the contacting residues gives a better prediction compared to C-beta &#x0226b; 7.0 &#x0212b; distances (Table 3 and 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary material</xref>). Surprisingly, although it still ranks high, the template structure 's own peptide does <italic>not</italic> have the highest score, indicating that this force field may not have adequate precision. Overall, there is a tendency that the nonbinding peptides are ranked lower than the binding ones, but it is not possible to differentiate the binder and non binder using these rankings.</p><p>The pair wise potential is used to estimate the binding energies of peptide sequences threaded upon the different structural template.MJ pair-wise contact potential table puts much emphasis on hydrophobic interaction for the MHC alleles that contain variouspockets of hydrophobic characters. Although most peptide are relatively buried within the binding groove of the MHC molecule,one can not assume that hydrophobic interaction are the mainly one that will tell binding from nonbinding peptides apart. So wehave used the table of BT that has modified table of MJ by changing the reference state from solvent to a defined singlesolvent like molecule, the amino acid threonine and improved the ranking of template. However, in some cases (HLA-A*0201-10/1I4F), the template structure's own peptide has a very bad score, and is predicted to have a binding affinity even lower thannonbinding peptides. The results of threading are very much dependent on the template structure used, as a peptide ranks highif its binding scheme is similar to the template peptide. Hence, using multiple templates potentially should provide a better fit forthe binding peptides. Therefore, this crude force field is not accurate enough to distinguish the subtle differences between thevarious peptide sequences.</p><p>For the other sequences, it is not possible to differentiate binding and nonbinding peptides based on energy using asingle template; however, some binders have lower scores using one template and have high scores in the other. Usingmultiple templates provides more possible conformations accessible in the binding groove than the binding sequencescan possibly assume. Therefore, taking the average of results from the two templates improves the results as seen in Table 5(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary material</xref>). The non binders are ranked lower than the binder, but once again, the binding and nonbinding peptides are not separated significant. In another test tojustify the use of the threading method, we evaluated their performances using the rank analysis of binding peptide inthe source protein sequences derived from the overlapping peptides. The BT potentials generally rank the templatestructure's own peptide high among all possible 8, 9 and 10-mers in the source protein (Table 6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary material</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Threading methodology employing two different statistical contact potentials (MJ and BT) and distance criteria(Nearest atom &#x0226b; 4.0 &#x0212b; and C-beta &#x0226b; 7.0 &#x0212b;) were applied to MHC class I molecules with a test set consisting of both itsnatural binding peptide and nonbinding peptide sequences The aim was to find which force field gives betterpredictions to rank and differentiate between the two groups in the test dataset, and hence determine which factors areimportant in the peptide recognition in MHC class I molecules. We found that using a BT force field, nearestatom &#x0226b; 4.0 &#x0212b; distance criteria and the average of results from multiple template structures gives better predictions.Nevertheless, we could not obtain results that could separate the binders from the nonbinders in the test dataset evenwhen we used multiple templates. This leads to the idea that shapes, rather than certain amino acids, are recognized bythe MHC. Although the MHC also adapts to bind different sequences, the binding groove restricts the conformationsaccessible to the bound peptide.</p><p>The affinity of the peptide is thus affected by how well it can fit into the volume defined by the binding groove. Thisfinding suggests that the &#x0201c;fitness&#x0201d; of a given peptide to the conformations accessible in the bound form is an importantdeterminant of its binding affinity. This also indicates that the force field precisely defines the energy of the peptidewhen the exact conformation is available. Thus the inverse folding approach is advantageous for MHC alleles that lackbinding data but have solved structure in complex with peptide, or alternatively, a structural model of the complexbased on known structures. In this postgenomic era, the approach is potentially useful for screening a library ofpotential binding sequences to the newly discovered proteins to develop epitope based vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Data 1</title></caption><media xlink:href="97320630003072S1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e288" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Mr. Feroz Khan, Central Institute of Aromatic and Medicinal Plant, Lucknow and Dr. Mohammad Israil Ansari, Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Lucknow Campus for the critical reading of the manuscript and valuable suggestions.
