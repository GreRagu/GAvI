Recently, iron nanoparticles have been widely used in coal industry to produce clean fuels due to their catalytic activities that facilitate the chemical reactions to form and cleave carbon-carbon bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. More importantly, iron nanoparticles show great potential in human biomedical applications, such as labeling and magnetic separation of biological materials, imaging and diagnostic applications in human, site-directed drug delivery, and anticancer hyperthermia therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, significant knowledge gaps currently exist on the precise mechanisms of translocation of iron nanoparticles into the targeted tissues, organs, and tumors, as well as the toxicological effect of iron nanoparticles, which would deter their broad applications.</p><p>Endothelial cells play a central role in angiogenesis, carcinogenesis, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, limb and cardiac ischemia, and tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The endothelium is an important target for drug and gene therapy. The vascular endothelial monolayer forms a semi-selective permeability barrier between blood and the interstitial space to control the movement of blood fluid, proteins, and macromolecules across the vessel wall. Alteration of permeability barrier integrity plays a major role in drug-based therapies, as well as the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, acute lung injury syndromes, and carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have shown that intravenously administrated iron nanoparticles can translocate from the blood circulation into various targeted tissues and organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, it is not clear how iron nanoparticles cross the endothelium from the blood stream into the targeted sites. In this study, we sought to examine whether iron nanoparticle exposure would induce an increase in permeability in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) and to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms involved. Particular emphasis was focused on the involvements of iron nanoparticle-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in endothelial cell permeability changes. The results in this report demonstrate that iron nanoparticle exposure induces an increase in permeability in HMVECs. This iron nanoparticle-induced permeability involves the production of ROS and the stabilization of microtubules. Furthermore, it was found that PI-3 kinase/Akt/GSK-3&#x003b2; pathways are the important mediators for iron nanoparticle-induced endothelial cell permeability. The results obtained from this study provide the evidence, for the first time, showing that iron nanoparticles may cross the endothelial monolayer through the induction of cell permeability. The results obtained from this study may also provide some insights for understanding the translocation pathways of nanoparticles in general.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Size distribution of nanoparticle in cell culture medium and uptake of iron nanoparticles by HMVECs</title><p>Iron nanoparticles used in these experiments are ferrites of maghemite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), which are superparamagnetic nanoparticles. Unmodified nanoparticles are usually colloidal in nature and prone to agglomerate in suspension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In order to accurately measure the size and distribution of iron nanoparticles in aqueous solutions, a TEM was applied to profile iron nanoparticles in 0.1% FBS cell culture medium. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, the nanoparticles ranged in size from 50 nm-600 nm. Since a TEM can only measure very limited number of particles in solution and the particles subjected to measurements are fixed and dried, it may not provide an accurate profile of the particles in the working solution. Therefore, we applied a dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement to further characterize the particle size in the working solution. These measurement results showed that iron nanoparticles existed in a size range from 100 nm-700 nm with a mean diameter of 298 nm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These results demonstrate that iron nanoparticles form small agglomerates, which are uniformly distributed in cell culture medium.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Size distribution and cell uptake of iron nanoparticles</bold>.

Here, we investigated the uptake of iron nanoparticles by HMVECs. The HMVEC line used here was immortalized by engineering human telomerase catalytic protein (hTERT) into the cells and are therefore able to maintain the inherent features of primary endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The cells were cultured to a confluent monolayer on transwell tissue culture-treated polycarbonate membrane polystyrene plates (Corning, NY), and then were stimulated with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml iron nanoparticles for different periods of time ranging from 10 min to 5 h. After the stimulation, the cells were processed for TEM analysis. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, the uptake of nanoparticles by HMVECS occurred as early as 10 min after the exposure, and the particles were localized within the cytoplasm of the cells. Approximately, 60% of the cells engulfed the nanoparticles within 30 min after the stimulation (data not shown). The iron nanoparticles were gradually expelled out of the cells, with only 10% of the cells retaining the nanoparticles after 1 h stimulation (data not shown). The results demonstrate that the uptake of iron nanoparticles by HMVECs is both efficient and dynamic.</p></sec><sec><title>Iron nanoparticles induce an increase in permeability of HMVECs</title><p>The changes in endothelial cell permeability not only play a major role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, inflammation and cancer, but also have a critical effect on drug delivery to underlying cells, tissues, and organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We investigated whether exposure to iron nanoparticles would induce an increase in endothelial cell permeability. These results using confocal microscopy image analysis show that the unstimulated HMVECs were attached to each other tightly with no significant intercellular gaps in the HMVEC monolayer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A1</xref>). However, upon exposure to iron nanoparticles, the confluent monolayer was pulled apart and the cells were separated from each other to form intercellular gaps, which is a hallmark of cell permeability increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The permeability increase occurred as early as 10 min after the exposure and persisted up to 5 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A2&#x02013;5</xref>). The increase in permeability peaked around 30 min after the exposure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A3</xref>). To further prove iron nanoparticle-induced HMVEC permeability, we measured transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) across HMVEC monolayer with an electric cell-substrate impedance sensor (ECIS). Our results demonstrate that exposure of HMVECs to iron nanoparticles decreased electrical resistance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), indicating endothelial monolayer barrier compromise. Our dose-dependent ECIS assays demonstrate that iron nanoparticles have an ability to induce endothelial permeability at the concentrations ranging from 12.5 &#x003bc;g/ml to 100 &#x003bc;g/ml (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that iron nanoparticle may induce endothelial permeability change due to cytotoxicity-related cell damage, the LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) release assays were performed. Our results indicate that at the concentration of 50 &#x003bc;g/ml, iron nanoparticles did not significantly induce cytotoxicity within 5 hours of incubation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that iron nanoparticles have an ability to induce an increase in cell permeability in HMVECs.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Iron nanoparticles induce endothelial cell permeability in HMVECs</bold>.

Cytoskeleton protein microtubules are the major structural proteins involved in endothelial cell permeability through the dynamic remodeling processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This study sought to investigate the importance of microtubule remodeling in iron nanoparticle-induced cell permeability in HMVECs. Here, we first identified whether iron nanoparticles had an ability to induce microtubule remodeling in HMVECs. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, the cells treated with iron nanoparticles exhibited a significant remodeled microtubule structure. In normal HMVECs, the acetylated microtubules, a stabilized form of microtubules, formed network-fiber structures surrounding the nuclear area. However, upon exposure to iron nanoparticles, the network-fiber structures were disrupted to form dotted structures distributed evenly throughout the cells, and the amount of acetylated microtubules was also increased. Next, we investigated the effects of iron nanoparticles on acetylated microtubules with immunoblotting analysis. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, iron nanoparticles induced an increase in acetylated microtubules as early as 10 min after the treatment. The increase in acetylated microtubules was maintained up to 1 h. These results demonstrate that iron nanoparticle exposure promotes microtubule polymerization and altered distribution in HMVECs.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Iron nanoparticles induce cell permeability through microtubule remodeling in HMVECs</bold>.

The results show that the pretreatment with paclitaxel increased iron nanoparticle-induced cell permeability whereas the pretreatment with nocodazole decreased the permeability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that iron nanoparticles induce endothelial cell permeability in HMVECs through the stabilization of microtubule structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Iron nanoparticles induce cell permeability through the production of ROS in HMVECs</title><p>Accumulating evidence strongly suggest that many materials at the nanoparticle size have the ability to induce the production of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We sought to determine if the production of ROS is involved in iron nanoparticle-induced cell permeability. First, we examined whether iron nanoparticle exposure stimulated ROS production in HMVECs with flow cytometry analysis. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A1</xref>, iron nanoparticle exposure significantly increased ROS production in 1 hour, compared to the unexposed cells. To determine the specificity of ROS production, the cells were pretreated with catalase, a ROS scavenger, followed by iron nanoparticle exposure. The results showed that catalase pretreatment blocked iron nanoparticle-induced ROS in HMVECs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A1</xref>). We also exposed the cells to 500 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>to set it as a positive control. Our results demonstrated that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>exposure induced the production of ROS in HMVECs, which was significantly inhibited by catalase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A1</xref>). To exclude the possibility that iron nanoparticles may generate ROS intrinsically, we measured the production of ROS in cell free systems. Our results found that iron nanoparticles were unable to produce ROS in cell-free systems (cell culture media without HMVECs); however the positive control, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, was able to produce significant amount of ROS in the same systems (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A2</xref>). These results demonstrate that iron nanoparticle-induced ROS production in HMVECs is generated from the cell oxidative stress response. We then investigated the importance of ROS production in iron nanoparticle-induced cell permeability with a ROS scavenger catalase. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B2</xref>, pretreatment of cells with catalase inhibited iron nanoparticle-induced dotted microtubule structures and microtubule distribution, and inhibited cell permeability as well, indicating that ROS are involved in the regulation of iron nanoparticle-induced microtubule remodeling and cell permeability. This study further confirmed the effect of ROS production on microtubule remodeling by immunoblotting analysis. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, the pretreatment of cells with catalase significantly attenuated iron nanoparticle-induced acetylated microtubule formation.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>ROS production is involved in iron nanoparticle-induced cell permeability</bold>.

C, ROS production is involved in iron nanoparticle-induced Akt activation and GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibition. HMVECs were pretreated with either 200 &#x003bc;M hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or 10,000 units/ml catalase for one hour, and then exposed to 50 &#x003bc;g/ml iron nanoparticles for 30 min, followed by Western blot analysis. D, The inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2; enhances iron nanoparticle-induced microtubule remodeling and cell permeability in HMVECs.

As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, hydrogen peroxide alone increased the phosphorylation of both GSK-3&#x003b2; (Ser-9) and Akt (Ser -473) in a manner similar to that of iron nanoparticle exposure. When the cells were treated with iron nanoparticles plus hydrogen peroxide, the induction of GSK-3&#x003b2; (Ser-9) and Akt (Ser-473) phosphorylation was enhanced compared with either treatment alone. Furthermore, the pretreatment of cells with catalase attenuated iron nanoparticle-induced phosphorylation of both GSK-3&#x003b2; (Ser 9) and Akt (Ser 473) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). These results indicate that ROS production plays a regulatory role in iron nanoparticle-induced GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibition and Akt activation.</p><p>Lastly, this study sought to determine the regulatory roles of GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibition in iron nanoparticle-induced microtubule remodeling and cell permeability by using a pharmacological inhibitor of GSK-3&#x003b2;, GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibitor I. These results demonstrate that the pretreatment with GSK-3&#x003b2; inhibitor I enhanced iron nanoparticle-induced microtubule remodeling and cell permeability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D2</xref>). These results suggest that GSK-3&#x003b2; may be involved in regulating iron nanoparticle-induced microtubule remodeling and cell permeability in HMVECs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The endothelial cells line the luminal surface of blood vessels to form a semi-permeable barrier to regulate vascular tone, blood fluidity, angiogenesis, and extravasation of blood components and other substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The changes in this semi-permeable barrier are critical in controlling the passage of macromolecules and fluid from the blood circulation into tissues, which is a key molecular process for drug delivery, as well as for the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, lung injury, carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The endothelial semi-permeable barrier controls the transfer of many soluble and insoluble substances via two pathways: transcellular and paracellular pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The transcellular pathway transports many substances via transcytosis in vesicle carriers whereas the paracellular pathway transfers substances through tightly linked inter-endothelial junctions. The paracellular pathway-mediated permeability is maintained by an equilibrium between cytoskeleton-generated contractile force and cell-cell junction and contact-induced adhesive force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Any shift in this equilibrium will results in the opening and closing of paracellular pathways to affect the transport of macromolecules and drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The unperturbed endothelium paracellular pathway can only allow transport of molecules with a radius of less than 3 nm to move passively across the barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, in response to stimulation or pathologic conditions, the paracellular pathway becomes leaky, opening inter-endothelial junctions to form the gaps between endothelial cells to allow the translocation of larger molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Previous studies reported that nanoparticles are able to across the semi-permeable barrier via transcellular pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, little is known about the effects of nanoparticles on endothelial paracellular pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that iron nanoparticle stimulation induced an increase in cell permeability <italic>in vitro</italic>, i.e., the formation of gap structures between endothelial cells in a confluent endothelial monolayer. This indicates that the exposure to iron nanoparticles may be able to facilitate extravasation of macromolecules and drugs, as well as nanoparticle themselves, into surrounding tissues. The results obtained from this study provide a new insight on the effects of nanoparticles on vascular transport of drugs and macromolecules.</p><p>The concentration (50 &#x003bc;g/ml) of iron nanoparticles applied in this manuscript is relevant to the dosages employed in current clinical trials. Human imaging in central nervous system and in carotid atherosclerotic plague utilized iron nanoparticles at 45 &#x003bc;mol Fe/kg for magnetic resonance imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], which is about the concentration of 70 &#x003bc;g/ml (at average 50 kg human weight and 5000 ml human blood volume). Rat clinical trials for magnetic resonance imaging injected iron nanoparticles via intravenous injection at the dose of 5 mg Fe/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], which is about the concentration of 66 &#x003bc;g/ml (at average 200 g rat weight and 15 ml rat blood volume). Therefore, our concentration (50 &#x003bc;g/ml) of iron nanoparticles is achievable in the circulation. The studies of iron nanoparticle pharmacokinetics and biodistribution demonstrated that the high doses of iron nanoparticles are needed to reach deep compartments of bodies in clinical imaging experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The cellular uptake profiling shows that the peak of uptake occurs within 30 min of the stimulation and only 10% of the cells still retain iron nanoparticles after one hour of exposure. However, the alteration of signaling transduction pathway are maintained for almost two hours following exposure to iron nanoparticles, and both our confocal microscope analysis and ECIS assays show that iron nanoparticle-induced permeability lasts at least 5 hours after the stimulation. There results indicate that exposure of HMVECs to iron nanoparticles induces a prolong alteration of endothelial monolayer barrier function.</p><p>The unique features of nanoparticles are small particle size and large surface area, which exposes atoms or molecules on the particle surface instead of covering them within the interior of the material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Accumulating evidence shows that nanoparticle-induced ROS oxidant stress response is the major mechanism for the induction of various biological effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. At the low basal level, ROS is involved in regulating normal cell functions; however, at a higher abnormal level, ROS induce cell injury and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this study, it was found that the exposure to iron nanoparticles induces the production of ROS in HMVECs. Furthermore, we found that the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>enhances iron nanoparticle-induced cell permeability whereas the elimination of ROS with catalase abrogates iron nanoparticle-induced cell permeability, demonstrating that the production of ROS is involved in iron nanoparticle-induced permeability. Our results regarding the roles of ROS in endothelial cell permeability are consistent with several published observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Numerous studies have shown that ROS-induced oxidant stress directly increases endothelial permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The treatment of endothelial cell monolayers with ROS generators, xanthine/xanthine oxidase or glucose/glucose oxidase, increases endothelial cell permeability in a dose dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In this study, it was found that iron nanoparticle-induced ROS production may regulate cell permeability through the remodeling of microtubules in HMVECs. It was well established that microtubules remodeling is closely related to the changes in endothelial cell permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, it is controversial as to the mechanisms by which microtubule remodeling regulates cell permeability. Several previous studies showed that microtubules are involved in regulating both tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and thrombin-induced endothelial permeability through destabilization (depolymerization) while some observations found that microtubules modulate cell permeability via stabilization (polymerization) in tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In this study, it is demonstrated that iron nanoparticle exposure induces both polymerization and redistribution of microtubules through the production of ROS in HMVECs. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that ROS-mediated microtubule remodeling is involved in iron nanoparticle-induced endothelial cell permeability. The finding that iron nanoparticle exposure stimulates the activation of PI-3 kinase/Akt/GSK-3&#x003b2; signaling pathways further supports our observations of iron nanoparticle-induced microtubule remodeling. GSK-3&#x003b2; is a key kinase that regulates microtubule depolymerization via the phosphorylation of several microtubule-associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Serine-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b2; by Akt inhibits its activities, which abrogates GSK-3&#x003b2;'s ability to phosphorylate microtubule-associated protein and results in microtubule stabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These results demonstrated that iron nanoparticle exposure induces the activation of Akt and inhibition of GSK-3&#x003b2; in a PI3-kinase dependent manner, and both our inhibitory and stimulatory assays strongly indicate that Akt/GSK-3&#x003b2; signaling pathways are involved in iron nanoparticle-induced cell permeability through ROS-mediated remodeling of microtubules.</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that exposure to iron nanoparticle induces an increase in endothelial cell permeability through ROS oxidative stress- modulated microtubule remodeling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The findings from this study provide new insights on the effects of nanoparticles on vascular transport of macromolecules and drugs. Results provided here may have implications for understanding the bioactivity of engineered nanoparticles, which can inform potential applications in both nanomedicine and elucidate nanotoxicology in general.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of signal transduction from iron nanoparticle stimulation to cell permeability</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-8977-6-1-6"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Cell culture medium EBM-2 was obtained from Lonza (Boston, MA).
