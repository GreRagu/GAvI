When evaluation of eosinophilia fails to reveal an underlying disease, the diagnosis of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is evocated. HES is defined by (1) eosinophilia (&#x0003e; 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L) for more than 6 months; (2) exclusion of reactive eosinophilia caused by parasitic infections, allergies, or other known causes, as well as eosinophilia associated with neoplasias; and (3) evidence of end-organ damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Over the last decade, great progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of HES that has resulted in the characterization of specific genetic alterations linked to clonal eosinophilia. The most frequent genetic aberration is the cryptic deletion of 4q12, i.e. del(4)(q12), producing the FIP1-like 1/platelet-derived growth factor receptor alfa (<italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA</italic>) fusion transcript, which results in an eosinophilic, myeloproliferative disorder (chronic eosinophilic leukaemia, CEL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, in a subset of patients with HES, eosinophilia is secondary to a primitive Th2 lymphoid disorder, overproducing interleukin-5 (IL-5), indicating the existence of lymphocyte-mediated HES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>fusion gene induces increased tyrosine kinase activity of PDGFRA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and is present in approximately 10&#x02013;15% of patients with HES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Despite the fact that these patients appear to have a more severe disease phenotype, involving extensive end-organ pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], they are dramatically sensitive to treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, early detection of <italic>FIPIL1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement and the subsequent imatinib administration can offer to the affected patients an excellent clinical therapeutic outcome, avoiding undesirable morbidity and mortality.</p><p>This study was undertaken in order to examine both the prevalence and the associated clinicopathologic and genetic features of <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement in a cohort of 15 adult patients presenting with eosinophilia and an absolute eosinophil count higher than 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) from 15 patients (male/female: 7/8, mean age: 45.2 years, range: 22&#x02013;72 years) with eosinophilia (eosinophils &#x0003e; 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L), without an unambiguous history of allergic diseases, were referred to the Immunology Lab and examined for the presence of <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement. Regardless of the molecular analysis, a complete clinical and laboratory examination was also performed. The diagnosis of idiopathic HES, systemic mastocytosis and/or CEL was based either on standard diagnostic criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] or on the result of the molecular analysis. Cytogenetic analysis was performed in all, but one, patients with primary eosinophilia and in two patients, for which ultimately another diagnosis was made. Flow cytometric analysis for the demonstration of CD3-CD4+ or CD3+CD4-CD8- clones, implicated in lymphocyte-mediated HES, was performed in all patients, but serum vitamin B12, IL-5 and mast cell tryptase levels were not assayed. Detection of <italic>C-KIT</italic>-D816V mutation was performed retrospectively in all cases with primary eosinophilia.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of both hospitals (University Hospital of Larissa and Papageorgiou General Hospital, Greece).</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular analyses</title><sec><title>Detection of FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion</title><p>The <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement was analyzed by a modified nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In particular, RNA was extracted from BM or PB, and cDNA was reversed transcribed, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. One sixth of the synthesized cDNA was used in a first PCR reaction of 30 &#x003bc;L, using 62.5 &#x003bc;M of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 20 pmol of each primer (sense: 5'-ACCTGGTGCTGATCTTTCTGAT-3' and antisense: 5'-TGAGAGCTTGTTTTTCACTGGA-3'), 1.6 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 1.4 &#x003bc;L of Taq Elongase (Invitrogen, UK) in a PCR buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Thereafter, 1 uL of the first PCR product was used as template for the nested PCR reaction (30 uL), along with 62.5 &#x003bc;M of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 10 pmol of each primer (sense: 5'-AAAGAGGATACGAATGGGACTTG-3' and antisense: 5'-GGGACCGGCTTAATCCATAG-3'), 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 0.5 U of Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen, UK) in a PCR buffer supplied by the manufacturer. The primary PCR conditions were: 2 min at 94&#x000b0;C followed by 32 cycles (94&#x000b0;C for 45 sec, 56&#x000b0;C for 45 sec, 68&#x000b0;C for 75 sec) followed by 5 min at 68&#x000b0;C. The conditions for the nested PCR were: 2 min at 94&#x000b0;C followed by 25 cycles (94&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 72&#x000b0;C for 60 sec) followed by 5 min at 72&#x000b0;C after the last cycle. All PCR amplifications were carried out in the PCR-engine apparatus PTC-200, MJ Research (Watertown-Mass., USA). The first and nested PCR products were analyzed in 2.5% TBE agarose gels.

In particular, DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen, UK), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Semi-nested PCR was performed, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], with some modifications. In particular, the first PCR was performed in a final volume of 30 &#x003bc;L containing 100 uM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5 U Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, UK), and 10 pmol of each primer (sense: 5'-CACAGAGACTTGGCAGCCAG-3' and antisense: 5'-CAGGATTTACATTATGAAAGTCACGG-3'). Aliquots of 1 &#x003bc;L of the PCR product served as template for the semi-nested PCR, using the same concentrations as above. The primers for the nested PCR were: sense 5'-ATCCTCCTTACTCATGGTCGGATC-3' and the same antisense used for the primary PCR. Each PCR cycle consisted of 30 seconds denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C, 30 sec annealing at 56&#x000b0;C, and 45 sec extension at 72&#x000b0;C. The first cycle was preceded by two minutes denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C. The last cycle was extended by a five minute elongation at 72&#x000b0;C. The first PCR run for 30 cycles and nested-PCR for 25 cycles. All PCR amplifications were carried out in the PCR-engine apparatus PTC-200, MJ Research (Watertown-Mass., USA).</p><p>To detect the presence of the <italic>C-KIT</italic>-D816V mutation, the semi-nested PCR products were digested with the endonuclease HinfI (New England Biolabs, USA) and the restriction products were analysed by electrophoresis on a 4% agarose TBE gels. The <italic>C-KIT</italic>-D816V mutation creates a second restriction site within the semi-nested PCR products. The predicted sizes for the wild-type sequence were 121 bp and 68 bp, and for the mutated sequence 121 bp, 68 bp, 54 bp, and 14 bp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Amongst the 15 patients with eosinophilia, only two were positive for the <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement (13,3%).

Initially the rash was considered to be of allergic etiology and the patient received local corticosteroids by a dermatologist. Nevertheless, a progressive deterioration of the rash was observed, and the patient also complained of fatigue and muscle weakness accompanied by hypaesthesia of the peripheral parts of the lower extremities that led to the weakness of walk, one week prior to admission. At that time, the laboratory tests showed that the eosinophils increased to 11.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L and moreover, a mild anaemia (Hb: 12.5 gr/dl) was present. Clinical examination revealed splenomegaly (palpable spleen 8 cm below the left costal margin), vesicular exanthema on the abdomen and the low extremities and absent deep tendon reflexes. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed an extensive eosinophil infiltration (68%), whilst the cytogenetic analysis was normal. Molecular analysis excluded the presence of <italic>BCR-ABL </italic>transcript, while a <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement was documented (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Imatinib was initiated at a dosage of 400 mg and after 14 days of treatment, the eosinophil count significantly declined along with a dramatic reduction of splenomegaly. Imatinib was well tolerated with an initial decrease of Hb levels to 9 gr/dl, that was resolved by reducing the imatinib dosage to 200 mg per day and administrating 150 mcg of darbepoetin alfa, twice weekly subcutaneously. The mobility and the hypaesthesia were recovered 2 months later and PB and BM molecular signal of the <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>fusion gene were undetectable 4 months after treatment.

A clinical examination revealed only splenomegaly (palpable spleen 2 cm below the left costal margin). Bone marrow aspiration was dry-tap, and for this reason cytogenetic analysis was not performed. However bone marrow biopsy revealed an extensive infiltration (80%) by eosinophils. Molecular analysis revealed the presence of the <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement. Imatinib was started at a dosage of 100 mg two weeks after the estimation of eosinophilia and after 14 days of treatment, the eosinophil count become normal (0.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and the spleen was not palpable below the left costal margin. Imatinib was well tolerated without side effects, and PB and BM molecular signal of the <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>fusion gene was undetectable 3 months after treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we describe our experience for the diagnostic utility of the detection of <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement in patients with profound eosinophilia. In our cohort, the prevalence of <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement was 13.3% in the total analysed group and 40% among patients with primary eosinophilia. Till now, the recorded proportion of <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA</italic>-positive cases among such patients varies widely, ranging from 0% to 56%, probably reflecting small sample sizes, as in our cohort, and variable inclusion criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the study, with the largest cohort, Pardanani and co-workers screened 741 patients with moderate to severe eosinophilia and reported a 3% prevalence of <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>fusion positivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, Klion also noted that 10%&#x02013;50% of patients meeting the classic definition of HES may be <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA</italic>-positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It is obvious, that a subsequent meta-analysis, taking into account all published studies, could clarify the true prevalence of <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement in patients with idiopathic eosinophilia and HES.</p><p>The detection of <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement in the second patient, directly after the estimation of eosinophilia, resulted in the early diagnosis of CEL, with a profound impact on the patient's clinical course and outcome. Thus, it is not unreasonable to speculate that the usage of molecular techniques for the early diagnosis of suspected <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA</italic>-positive leukemias, can modify the diagnostic criteria of hypereosinophilic syndrome with significant impact in undesirable morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Interestingly, in both patients with <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement, the breakpoints into <italic>PDGFRA </italic>were located in exon 12 and fused with exons 8 and 8a of <italic>FIP1L1</italic>, respectively. Till now, all described breakpoints occurred in an <italic>FIP1L1 </italic>intron (spread from 7 to 10 at genomic DNA level) and in exon 12 of <italic>PDGFRA </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although in all reported cases, the <italic>PDGFRA </italic>breakpoints were variable, they were limited to exon 12 and more specifically within the region encoding a WW-like domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A similar finding was also observed in our patients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). There is strong evidence that the result of <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement is an interrupted <italic>PDGFRA </italic>juxtamembrane region, due to an interstitial deletion of a tryptophan (W) residue of the putative WW-domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This domain is believed to be a negative regulator of kinase activity and serves as an auto-inhibitory domain. Thus, the interruption of the juxtamembrane region of <italic>PDGFRA </italic>may serve as the primary mode of constitutive kinase activation and the leukemic transformation of the affected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In our study, both patients with <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement were male and exhibited splenomegaly, similar to the majority of the positive patients reported in the literature. It is noteworthy that one patient displayed rash as a presenting sign, considering that skin involvement is rare in CEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Moreover, this patient displayed undesirable morbidity due to initial misdiagnosis, while the second one was diagnosed early after the demonstration of eosinophilia in routine laboratory examination, without reference to the diagnostic criteria of HES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This point should be highlighted, considering that even in such patients, cardiac damage can be irreversible. On the other hand, 2 HES patients were also sensitive to imatinib treatment, and remained in CHR, receiving imatinib 9 and 50 months, respectively, after diagnosis. It has been reported that up to 40% of imatinib responding patients lack the <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], suggesting the activation of other, still unknown, tyrosine kinases that may contribute to disease pathogenesis and phenotype. Although in a recent report, Baccarani and coworkers reported that such patients need higher doses of imatinib and usually relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], this does not appear to be absolutely the rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], since in our cohort 2 HES patients remain in CHR and clinical remission, receiving 100 and 400 mg of imatinib, respectively, as maintenance treatment.</p><p>Moreover, we treated another patient with primary eosinophilia, whose diagnosis was ultimately systemic mastocytosis. Regardless of the presence or absence of <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>or <italic>C-KIT</italic>-D816V, patients with SM may present with eosinophilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is well documented today that some of these patients carry the <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement and are sensitive to imatinib treatment, suggesting that the molecular pathogenesis for this subset of patients is similar to that of CEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Indeed, it has been recently proposed that these patients should be appropriately classified as systemic mastocytosis-CEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, our patient was negative for the <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA </italic>rearrangement, as well as for the <italic>C-KIT</italic>-D816V mutation, and did not respond to imatinib treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>An early diagnosis of <italic>FIP1L1-PDGFRA</italic>-positive CEL and imatinib treatment can offer to affected patients an excellent clinical therapeutic result, avoiding undesirable morbidity and mortality. Moreover, although the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis and phenotype remain to be determined, imatinib can also be effective in patients with idiopathic HES.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MS was primarily responsible for this work, from conception to submission of the manuscript and wrote the paper.
