Non-diapause reproducing adults, however, lack the capacity to express a whole array of cold-tolerance adaptations and show relatively low survival when exposed to sub-zero temperatures. We assessed the competence of non-diapause males of <italic>P. apterus</italic> for responding to heat- and cold-stresses by up-regulation of 70 kDa heat shock proteins (Hsps) and the role of Hsps during repair of heat- and cold-induced injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>The fragments of <italic>P. apterus</italic> homologues of Hsp70 inducible (PaHsp70) and cognate forms (PaHsc70) were cloned and sequenced. The abundance of mRNA transcripts for the inducible form (qPCR) and corresponding protein (Western blotting) were significantly up-regulated in response to high and low temperature stimuli. In the cognate form, mRNA was slightly up-regulated in response to both stressors but very low or no up-regulation of protein was apparent after heat- or cold-stress, respectively. Injection of 695 bp-long <italic>Pahsp70</italic> dsRNA (RNAi) caused drastic suppression of the heat- and cold-stress-induced <italic>Pahsp70</italic> mRNA response and the up-regulation of corresponding protein was practically eliminated. Our RNAi predictably prevented recovery from heat shock and, in addition, negatively influenced repair of chilling injuries caused by cold stress. Cold tolerance increased when the insects were first exposed to a mild heat shock, in order to trigger the up-regulation of PaHsp70, and subsequently exposed to cold stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that accumulation of PaHsp70 belongs to a complex cold tolerance adaptation in the insect <italic>Pyrrhocoris apterus</italic>.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insects evolved impressive strategies for survival at sub-zero body temperatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004546-Lee1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

We suggest that the accumulation of PaHsp70 also contributes to this complex cold tolerance syndrome in <italic>P. apterus</italic>. Its significance was attested in non-diapause males. Non-diapause insects, however, do not express the whole battery of cold tolerance mechanisms (as described above) and, consequently, posses much lower capacity for cold acclimation and much lower level of cold tolerance than diapause insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004546-lachta1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. It remains to be tested what the relative importance of Hsp70 up-regulation is on the backround of other potent cold tolerance adaptations in cold-hardy diapause insects.

High levels of Hsps during dormancy may represent an anticipatory protection against a variety of environmental insults and/or may participate in the regulation of dormancy state.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Irena Vackov&#x000e1; for her help with maintaining insect colonies and to Lisa Lalouette (University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France) for her help with preparation of cDNA samples for qPCR analysis.
