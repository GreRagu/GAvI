INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with cancer experience many physical and emotional symptoms. When these patients self-report their symptoms, the prevalence and severity data for the symptoms tend to vary significantly from those identified by health care providers and from the data recorded in charts and on research forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-co16-1-55e53">1</xref>. Patients may be better able to identify and assess symptoms that have a larger subjective component&#x02014;for example, pain or fatigue. Discrepancies in clinical priorities and symptom subjectivity may explain the dissatisfaction with physical care registered by 20% of cancer patients in Ontario, and the dissatisfaction with emotional care registered by 43% (2004&#x02013;2006) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-co16-1-55e53">2</xref>. Systematic symptom assessment tools completed by patients just before ambulatory and in-hospital clinical visits have a potential to shape encounters and may improve rapport, efficiency, informed consent, administered care, and patient compliance, and likewise, satisfaction with care.</p><p>A number of screening instruments for symptoms have been introduced. These range from single-focus tools to instruments that target multiple domains, and from checklists to multiple-item indices with complex scoring methods. For instance, some measures aggregate items into a summary score that may be linked to a concept such as distress or quality of life (<sc>qol</sc>). For patients with cancer, only a limited set of instruments are available for possible clinical use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-co16-1-55e53">3</xref>. These include the Distress Thermometer (<sc>dt</sc>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-co16-1-55e53">4</xref>, the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (<sc>msas</sc>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-co16-1-55e53">5</xref>, and the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (<sc>esas</sc>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-co16-1-55e53">6</xref>. Tools more prevalent in research contexts include the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (<sc>eortc</sc>) tools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-co16-1-55e53">7</xref> and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (<sc>fact</sc>) tools<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-co16-1-55e53">8</xref>, although these may also be used in clinical practice.</p><p>The <sc>esas</sc> was first described in 1991 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-co16-1-55e53">6</xref> as a way to audit symptoms for patients on palliative care wards daily. This single-page screening tool has been praised for its brevity and ease of use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-co16-1-55e53">9</xref>, and is frequently described as practical, reliable, and valid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-co16-1-55e53">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-co16-1-55e53">18</xref>. Cancer Care Ontario recently implemented the <sc>esas</sc> in cancer clinics across the province, intending administration at every patient visit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-co16-1-55e53">19</xref>. Some clinics in Ontario already have experience with the <sc>esas</sc>, but others have yet to use it as a process of care. Implementation requires interpreting the <sc>esas</sc> and having acceptable responses to the information it provides.</p><p>The purpose of the present review is to summarize what is known about the <sc>esas</sc>; to understand its reliability, validity, and interpretive schemes; to guide its use by patients and health care providers; and to prioritize research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>2.

A hand search was conducted for articles in personal files and for citations in papers, textbooks, and reference books.

Sample sizes in the thirty-three oncologic studies ranged from 32 to 1296 subjects, for a total in excess of 5000 patients. However, eleven of the thirty-three studies reported some data for the same patients: Sunnybrook Cancer Centre in Canada <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-co16-1-55e53">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-co16-1-55e53">28</xref>, Bispebjerg Hospital in Denmark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-co16-1-55e53">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-co16-1-55e53">39</xref>, Linkoping Hospital in Sweden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-co16-1-55e53">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-co16-1-55e53">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-co16-1-55e53">36</xref>, and Yale University <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-co16-1-55e53">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-co16-1-55e53">34</xref>. For the patients described in the thirty-three papers, median age ranged from 53 to 74 years, and men were in a slight majority overall. Most studies used the <sc>esas</sc> in its English or northern European language versions, and most of the study subjects were white.</p><p>Of the thirty-three oncologic studies, twenty-nine were conducted in palliative populations with advanced cancer, and more than one half of these studies administered the <sc>esas</sc> exclusively to hospitalized patients for acute admission, for time-limited and long-term admissions, when in intensive care, and with symptom acuity or with stable disease. The most frequent diagnoses were lung and gastrointestinal malignancies, although many other cancer types were represented. The overall distribution was perhaps typical of a palliative population. In the non-hospital but palliative context, most subjects were at home <sup>17,18,22,25&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-co16-1-55e53">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-co16-1-55e53">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-co16-1-55e53">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-co16-1-55e53">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-co16-1-55e53">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-co16-1-55e53">47</xref> or at a hospice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-co16-1-55e53">48</xref>. Overall, the &#x0201c;extreme&#x0201d; condition of the subjects is reflected in the descriptions provided in the papers themselves: disease was &#x0201c;advanced,&#x0201d; patients were &#x0201c;terminally ill,&#x0201d; symptoms were &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;severe&#x0201d; (justifying hospitalization), performance status was intermediate-to-low [median Karnofsky performance status (<sc>kps</sc>): 40&#x02013;70], and reduced cognitive functioning was present in some patients. Longitudinal studies reported that one half of all patients dropped out from questionnaire completion within weeks during follow-up. Where reported, median survival was less than 3 months.</p><p>Of the twenty-nine studies in palliation, five included patients receiving active cancer therapies apart from supportive and palliative care: four targeted patients managed with radiotherapy (of which 75% were outpatients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-co16-1-55e53">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-co16-1-55e53">28</xref>), and one studied survival with palliative chemotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-co16-1-55e53">44</xref>. Finally, the remaining four of the thirty-three oncologic studies focused on less-palliative situations: one study looked at participants of three randomized trials, including 48 survivors of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-co16-1-55e53">14</xref>; one included a &#x0201c;general cancer population&#x0201d; of 240 patients being managed with curative intent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-co16-1-55e53">31</xref>; one included patients having lymphoma or leukemia (although, on average, more than 2 years after initial diagnosis and in hospital) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-co16-1-55e53">33</xref>; and one examined patients between 6 and 36 months after initial diagnosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-co16-1-55e53">37</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>3.2 Face and Content Validity</title><p>Despite relative uniformity of the clinical contexts in which the <sc>esas</sc> was administered, its format and the symptoms that were included varied. Authors described these as &#x0201c;modifications&#x0201d; that included changed items, added items, and changes in descriptors or scales.</p><p>Typically, symptom scales were presented horizontally&#x02014;a presentation that may make the <sc>esas</sc> seem simple and consistent to patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-co16-1-55e53">47</xref>. However, the orientation of visual analog scales (horizontal vs. vertical) may have a critical influence on measurement. This factor requires further investigation with the <sc>esas</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-co16-1-55e53">50</xref>. Noticeably distinct from the original <sc>esas</sc> was replacement of a visual analog scale (0&#x02013;100 mm) with categorical numbered scales (0&#x02013;10). One study further reduced scales to 5 categories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-co16-1-55e53">12</xref>, and others reduced them to 4 categories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-co16-1-55e53">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-co16-1-55e53">34</xref>. No comparisons of these versions of scales have been published, although some authors have claimed that visual analog and numeric scales elicit similar scoring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-co16-1-55e53">51</xref>. Numeric scales may be more acceptable to patients, more efficient to score <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-co16-1-55e53">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-co16-1-55e53">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-co16-1-55e53">48</xref>, and applicable from bedside care to telephone follow-up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-co16-1-55e53">25</xref>.</p><p>Another noticeable modification to the <sc>esas</sc> was the period over which symptoms were to be scored. This period has varied from as short as &#x0201c;at present&#x0201d; or within the past few hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-co16-1-55e53">51</xref>, up to several days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-co16-1-55e53">48</xref> or weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-co16-1-55e53">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-co16-1-55e53">37</xref>. Most studies administered the <sc>esas</sc> daily, without explicitly defining a period of assessment. The importance of being specific is clear for the &#x0201c;severe pain&#x0201d; item, where &#x0201c;severe pain&#x0201d; is understood by patients to mean &#x0201c;worst pain&#x0201d; rather than some other statistic or estimate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-co16-1-55e53">31</xref>, and the influence of time period on all items remains a concern.</p><p>The number of symptoms in the <sc>esas</sc> has varied from 8 items (in the original version) to more than 11&#x02014;typically with 1 &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; scale for an additional rater-selected symptom. The most recent version of the <sc>esas</sc> includes 9 symptoms&#x02014;(in order) pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, well) being, and shortness of breath (<sc>sob</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-co16-1-55e53">52</xref>. A score of 10 is described as the &#x0201c;worst possible&#x0201d; symptom. This recent <sc>esas</sc> version includes 7 of the 12 most common symptoms identified in large surveys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-co16-1-55e53">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-co16-1-55e53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-co16-1-55e53">54</xref>. These symptoms may be common, but they need not be the most distressing symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-co16-1-55e53">35</xref>&#x02014;except for pain, which has been established to be important for palliative patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-co16-1-55e53">55</xref>. Across all thirty-three oncologic studies reviewed, only 3 symptoms were included in almost every version of the <sc>esas</sc>: pain, depression, and anxiety. All other symptoms have been replaced with alternatives, including gastrointestinal problems such as constipation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-co16-1-55e53">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-co16-1-55e53">16</xref>, and sleep-related problems such as insomnia or difficulty sleeping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-co16-1-55e53">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-co16-1-55e53">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-co16-1-55e53">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-co16-1-55e53">41</xref>. When new items were added to the <sc>esas</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-co16-1-55e53">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-co16-1-55e53">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-co16-1-55e53">34</xref>, investigators sometimes found those items to be more clinically appropriate.</p><p>Discussion of content brings into focus a question of whether the <sc>esas</sc> domains exhibit &#x0201c;balance.&#x0201d; In all versions, physical symptoms outnumber items that may represent psycho-emotional symptoms. Patients are likely to perceive the focus to be physical symptoms. However, these symptoms (typically, reduced appetite, nausea, drowsiness, tiredness, pain, and <sc>sob</sc>) may sometimes be manifestations of psychological disorders or components of psychiatric diagnoses. Further, the terms &#x0201c;anxiety&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;depression&#x0201d; may be relatively salient because of their connotations&#x02014;that is, are these folk and non-stigmatizing language, or are they psychiatric labels? Studies of the <sc>esas</sc> reveal significant changes in depression scores within days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-co16-1-55e53">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-co16-1-55e53">13</xref>, which suggests that patients interpret &#x0201c;depression&#x0201d; as a dynamic process, a feeling, or an emotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-co16-1-55e53">11</xref>&#x02014;although in a few studies, the change may simply be a regression-to-the-mean bias arising from the subgrouping of patients by initial scores. Some investigators have used &#x0201c;feelings of depression&#x0201d; as the descriptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-co16-1-55e53">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-co16-1-55e53">34</xref>.</p><p>Finally, <sc>qol</sc> and well-being may not be legitimate symptoms or items for the <sc>esas</sc><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-co16-1-55e53">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-co16-1-55e53">31</xref>. First, they may not transfer accurately across cultures and languages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-co16-1-55e53">17</xref>. Second, well-being may be understood to be a more psychological term&#x02014;an outcome of care and not a symptom. It was originally considered to be an internal summary for all other items <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-co16-1-55e53">51</xref>, which raises a second aspect of &#x0201c;balance&#x0201d; between measuring negative symptoms and deficits, and measuring positive strengths and attributes. The focus of the <sc>esas</sc> is the former, but a strict opposition or correspondence between negative and positive domains is not a requirement. Both may be needed for clinical management.</p></sec><sec><title>3.3 Theoretical Validity</title><p>The literature provides no theoretical justification for the <sc>esas</sc> and its content. An argument may be made that a theory or an overall meaning to the <sc>esas</sc> is not necessary, because the goal may simply be practical: to identify a few active symptoms using a consistent listing and scoring system across patients.</p></sec><sec><title>3.4 Score Distributions</title><p>Summary baseline <sc>esas</sc> scores were provided in more than half of the studies reviewed, but one third of the thirty-nine papers did not provide mean scores or distributions by individual items. Baseline average scores ranged from a low of 6 to a high of 75 (out of 100) for all symptoms, but nausea was consistently the lowest-scoring item (range: 6&#x02013;28), and activity level (range: 49&#x02013;75), fatigue (range: 44&#x02013;67), appetite (range: 44&#x02013;61), and <sc>qol</sc> [47 (only one study)] were the highest. In general, mean scores were typically less than 50 out of 100, with distributions exhibiting significant &#x0201c;floor&#x0201d; effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-co16-1-55e53">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-co16-1-55e53">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-co16-1-55e53">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-co16-1-55e53">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-co16-1-55e53">31</xref>.

Mean scores this low would not be expected in palliative studies, in which investigators describe symptoms as moderate-to-severe (although the most severe symptoms might not be captured with the <sc>esas</sc>). Possibly, some patients interpreted the 11-point scales as having fewer categories, were unable to distinguish adjacent categories, or failed to understand the scale as linear and strictly interval. Low mean scores in the <sc>esas</sc> reflected scores of exactly 0 (that is, no symptom) given by 40%&#x02013;57% of palliative patients on some items <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-co16-1-55e53">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-co16-1-55e53">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-co16-1-55e53">31</xref>, although fewer than 2% of patients scored 0 on every symptom <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-co16-1-55e53">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-co16-1-55e53">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-co16-1-55e53">35</xref>. Reinforcing the floor effect, investigators differed with regard to the values that they took to mean symptom absence (alternatively, prevalence), because some used 0 to mean that a symptom was absent, and others used a range of values (for example, 0&#x02013;2 meant either no symptom or not a clinically significant symptom) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-co16-1-55e53">56</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>3.5 Reliability</title><p>Studies in which multiple instruments were co-administered with the <sc>esas</sc> looked at a very short time of administration, and they explored the effects of various formats, time periods, scales, wordings, and anchors when asking similar questions about a symptom. This type of reliability is often labelled &#x0201c;concurrent validity,&#x0201d; because it demonstrates a reproducible score despite variation in presentation.</p><p>Correlations between individual <sc>esas</sc> items and scores elicited by alternative tools are fairly good, particularly for physical symptoms.

Interestingly, providers underestimated physical symptoms and overestimated well-being, anxiety, and depression. Physician-or-patient ratings had relatively weak Pearson coefficients for drowsiness (0.33), well-being (0.44), and depression (0.49), and were non-significant for nausea and anxiety. Likewise, coefficients for nurse-or-patient associations were weak for <sc>sob</sc>, drowsiness, and depression (0.32, 0.43, and 0.43 respectively).</p><p>Finally, an estimate using generalizability theory <sc>20</sc> suggested that 3 raters on 1 occasion or 2 raters over 2 occasions within 1 day are required to achieve acceptable reliability.

These results suggest that items are interrelated and that a combination represents a latent construct. However, it has been noted that, if the <sc>esas</sc> estimates <sc>qol</sc> (for instance), then it is not necessary that a patient suffer from all symptoms to have a poor <sc>qol</sc>, and that correlation-based methods will be inappropriate for scale validation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-co16-1-55e53">17</xref>.

Such interpretations assume, rather than establish, the validity of the <sc>esas</sc>.</p><p>Third, several studies investigated whether the <sc>esas</sc>-<sc>sds</sc> or separate <sc>esas</sc> items associate with disposition from consultation and with overall survival. These analyses are complicated by the possibility that <sc>esas</sc> scores may have helped caregivers decide subsequent clinical disposition (for example, into tertiary care) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-co16-1-55e53">22</xref>. Empirically, greater <sc>esas</sc> scores and reduced survival are associated in several studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-co16-1-55e53">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-co16-1-55e53">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-co16-1-55e53">49</xref>, but not in others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-co16-1-55e53">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-co16-1-55e53">45</xref>. Patients with greater <sc>esas</sc> scores may want fewer active interventions to prolong life. Further, whether the <sc>esas</sc> adds unique information relative to <sc>kps</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-co16-1-55e53">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-co16-1-55e53">31</xref> is not clear, although this association of the <sc>esas</sc> and <sc>kps</sc> was not evident in some studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-co16-1-55e53">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-co16-1-55e53">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-co16-1-55e53">49</xref>. Specific items on the <sc>esas</sc> are known to independently predict survival (physical symptoms such as reduced appetite and greater dyspnea, for example) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-co16-1-55e53">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-co16-1-55e53">44</xref>. Although the <sc>esas</sc> assesses those symptoms and so has the potential to be associated with overall survival, the primary purpose of the <sc>esas</sc> is to manage symptoms or to audit practice, regardless of expected survival.</p></sec><sec><title>3.9 Responsiveness</title><p>The <sc>esas</sc> has been repeatedly administered to the same sets of patients at between 2 and 30 or more days of follow-up. Longitudinal scores can be found in fifteen papers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-co16-1-55e53">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-co16-1-55e53">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-co16-1-55e53">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-co16-1-55e53">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-co16-1-55e53">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-co16-1-55e53">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-co16-1-55e53">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-co16-1-55e53">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-co16-1-55e53">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-co16-1-55e53">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-co16-1-55e53">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-co16-1-55e53">46</xref>. Given that some patients were admitted for great acuity of symptoms and for immediate care and benefit, and that others experienced very short survival times with increasing difficulties in completing the <sc>esas</sc>, such studies may be understood as tests of positive and negative responsiveness. However, other interpretations are certainly possible: for example, change in patient priorities, reinterpretation of symptoms and anchors, and sometimes simply a bias of regression to the mean as a result of the method of statistical analysis.</p><p>Many studies claimed that interventions were &#x0201c;successful&#x0201d; in reducing <sc>esas</sc> item scores and the overall <sc>esas</sc>-<sc>sds</sc>, but not all studies found mean scores to decline as predicted. Most studies did not tally or measure interventions, and they provided no data for associations between interventions and changes in scores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-co16-1-55e53">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-co16-1-55e53">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-co16-1-55e53">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-co16-1-55e53">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-co16-1-55e53">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-co16-1-55e53">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-co16-1-55e53">42</xref>. Heedman and Strang <sc>36</sc> showed no association between pain level and changes in pain medications, but others showed that some item scores responded to relevant interventions. For example, a few selected case studies presented by Bruera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-co16-1-55e53">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-co16-1-55e53">51</xref> nicely demonstrated the graphical use of <sc>esas</sc> item scores over time to monitor symptoms and to document effective care of individual patients. For populations of patients, anxiety and dyspnea declined in response to paracentesis for ascites, and both were related to self-reported overall improvement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-co16-1-55e53">29</xref>. Detailed studies by Chow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-co16-1-55e53">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-co16-1-55e53">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-co16-1-55e53">28</xref> provide telephone-based follow-up scores and sequential factor analyses for up to 12 weeks of follow-up subsequent to radiotherapy. These follow-ups demonstrated changes in scores and statistical factors, although the subject drop-out rate was high.</p><p>Missing data make conclusions fragile and potentially biased, but in comparing patients who responded to radiation with patients who did not, the baseline <sc>esas</sc> symptoms did not predict response to radiation, although scores diverged in the two groups during follow-up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-co16-1-55e53">28</xref>. For art therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-co16-1-55e53">33</xref>, the <sc>esas</sc>-<sc>sds</sc> mean value declined, but fewer than half of the patients approached to participate did so, and participants were favourably disposed to art therapy at baseline and may have overestimated the benefit. Therefore, from these studies, the overall impression is that the responsiveness of the <sc>esas</sc> remains questionable.</p><p>How frequently should the <sc>esas</sc> be administered to patients to measure change and interpret symptoms in follow-up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-co16-1-55e53">10</xref>?</p><p>Standard frequencies are not established for patients with various types of cancer, specific symptoms, and care-delivery contexts. Only in palliative contexts, and especially in hospitals, is daily <sc>esas</sc> administration reasonable, but even in that context, concern was raised regarding the benefits of finely tracking symptoms when these patients are deteriorating near the end of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-co16-1-55e53">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-co16-1-55e53">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-co16-1-55e53">42</xref>. For example, patients stop completing the <sc>esas</sc> in advance of death because of either inability or lack of perceived benefit. Labori <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-co16-1-55e53">40</xref> reported increased symptom intensity in the last 8 weeks before death, citing the natural elements of the terminal phase of disease that inevitably worsen. Dudgeon <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-co16-1-55e53">11</xref> showed that overall <sc>esas</sc> scores improved within 2 days, but subsequently deteriorated. Unfortunately, no studies have been performed in patients receiving adjuvant curative therapies to establish a frequency of administration.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>4. DISCUSSION</title><p>The <sc>esas</sc> is a relatively new instrument. A number of investigators have explicitly claimed that it has established reliability and validity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-co16-1-55e53">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-co16-1-55e53">17</xref>, citing several papers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-co16-1-55e53">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-co16-1-55e53">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-co16-1-55e53">47</xref>. However, Bruera <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-co16-1-55e53">6</xref> clearly identified the first paper on the <sc>esas</sc> as being only a &#x0201c;description of initial experience&#x0201d; and provided a limited statistical analysis that focused on the summary <sc>esas</sc>-<sc>sds</sc> and the value of the <sc>esas</sc> as an overall tool for auditing care for a population of patients. Hearn <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-co16-1-55e53">3</xref> reviewed 41 symptom-screening instruments through 1997, including the <sc>esas</sc>, and concluded that, of the 12 most relevant instruments, not one was comprehensive or ideal. Further criteria for appraisal were listed by Sloan <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68-co16-1-55e53">68</xref>, and many reports concerning the <sc>esas</sc> have been published since 1997.</p><p>Our review compiled a total of thirty-nine studies published through 2007. Of these, thirty-three were conducted predominantly or exclusively in the context of cancer. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tI-co16-1-55e53">TABLE I</xref> provides our conclusions, and we use the remainder of this discussion to explore implications for the use of the <sc>esas</sc>, its further development, and innovation to address emotional symptoms.</p><sec><title>4.1 Using the ESAS</title><p>One possible perspective on the <sc>esas</sc>, without making further modifications, is to use the tool as a limited but systematic extension of the conventional, indeed the venerable, &#x0201c;review of systems.&#x0201d; For this task, a &#x0201c;standard version of <sc>esas</sc>&#x0201d; would ensure that earlier research findings apply. Evidence suggests that proxy assessments are not substitutes for patient self-scoring of symptoms, and so the <sc>esas</sc> should be administered antecedent to clinical visits. The <sc>esas</sc> is brief, practical, rapid, and visual, and a numeric horizontal scale (0&#x02013;10) may be the best format. The time period to which the questions apply should be explicit. Score reliability is established for daily administration in the context of palliation, in particular for certain language groupings (English, for instance) and socio-ethnic backgrounds (for example, white) with advanced lung and gastrointestinal malignancies, many of whom are hospitalized. Discordance is noted between clinical impression (for example, severe symptoms) and actual patient scores (for example, a significant floor effect and low means in the score distributions); between in-chart documentation and <sc>esas</sc> scores; between the timing and intensity of interventions and any change in <sc>esas</sc> scores; and between <sc>esas</sc> scores on anxiety and depression and scores from screening tools such as <sc>hads</sc>. Therefore, to determine the patient&#x02019;s meaning for any <sc>esas</sc> score (for example, whether the scale is interval or merely ordinal, whether drift or resetting of anchors occurs, and whether symptoms of greater concern are not included in the <sc>esas</sc>) requires dialogue to turn possibly reliable and valid information into shared knowledge. Consequently, this tool has to be embedded within a strong clinical context such that <sc>esas</sc> values can be dialogically validated and translated into actions.</p><p>A patient&#x02019;s perceptions, interpretations, desires, and expectations must be understood. First, the plain meaning of all item scores has not been fully established&#x02014;for example, nausea could mean the most severe recent nausea&#x02014;although this is more a matter of refinement of the instrument. Second, the <sc>esas</sc> may empower patients only if it is relevant to them and if the clinical team does it justice by paying attention to it. Third, the meaning of an equally-weighted summary index (<sc>esas</sc>-<sc>sds</sc>) may be consistent with a latent construct of physical symptom distress (negative dimension) or with physical well-being (positive dimension). Besides responding to the score for each individual item in isolation, understanding and tracking of the summary index of the <sc>esas</sc>-<sc>sds</sc> seems appropriate.</p><p>We recommend using a standardized <sc>esas</sc> with palliative patients, especially with those who are hospitalized and who remain capable of completing the instrument. The optimal way to embed the <sc>esas</sc> into clinical processes and structures is still to be determined. Symptoms may then be linked with practitioners in respective clinical disciplines (for example, nutrition, psychology). The purposes for which the <sc>esas</sc> is best suited are the management of physical symptom assessment, clinical audit, and program development in supportive care (for example, by gathering information).</p></sec><sec><title>4.2 Further Developing ESAS to Address Physical Distress</title><p>We suggest further exploration of the role of the anchors and descriptors of the <sc>esas</sc> items to improve clarity (for example, time period, with or without a consideration of the effect of interventions) and to redistribute scores (for example, &#x0201c;upwards&#x0201d;) for statistical and interpretative purposes. Also, a test should be made of whether a simpler scale (fewer categories than the 11 sometimes used, or a 100-mm line) is better than revising anchors and time periods.</p><p>One practical approach to the <sc>esas</sc> is to focus on managing the items with the most extreme values (whatever their absolute scores), and another is to understand the larger set of symptoms, even when some are only &#x0201c;mild&#x0201d; in severity. The ability to detect prevalence for these purposes requires appropriate scaling, anchors, and descriptors, possibly with labels attached to numerically intermediate values.</p><p>We recommend that the number of physical symptoms be increased from 7 to at least 10, with items such as constipation and dry mouth being possible additions with wide relevance. In addition to large systematic surveys of symptoms, qualitative research (that is, focus groups) may be required to identify important items. Expanding the list of symptoms would reduce the need for investigators to constantly modify the <sc>esas</sc> or to supplement it with interviews for additional symptoms. However, the physical symptoms privileged by their inclusion in the <sc>esas</sc> should not be redundant (that is, from among the same symptom clusters or statistical factors), so that the <sc>esas</sc> can remain brief, efficient, and simple. The <sc>esas</sc> should target the symptoms with greatest meaning or clinical implication&#x02014;that is, those that cause important physical symptom distress reliably representing clustered symptoms that can be managed or treated or that have prognostic significance. To increase internal consistency (or factorization) and to strengthen the <sc>esas</sc>-<sc>sds</sc> in its estimation of &#x0201c;physical symptom distress,&#x0201d; we recommend removing items such as <sc>qol</sc>, well-being, anxiety, and depression from the <sc>esas</sc> and replacing them with more physically-oriented items. Conceivably, items could also be added to assess the effect of physical symptoms on other dimensions (for example, cognition, spiritual suffering, and the emotions representing disruptive physical symptoms), and to determine physical strengths (for example, exercise capacity or tolerance) that may help in management.</p><p>Although physical symptoms may interact and complicate management, a &#x0201c;first approximation&#x0201d; to managing core physical symptoms is to assume that they are entirely physical and can be effectively managed in isolation. This practical approach is an extension of the current model of supportive care. Cut-off values to categorize severity (mild, moderate, severe) have not been validated for the <sc>esas</sc>, and so sorting patients for various interventions by ranges of scores is problematic. There are probably more <sc>esas</sc> values (11) than there are clinical responses. Although physical symptoms and processes are the focus, interventions could include psychosocial and behavioural actions&#x02014;for example, managing fatigue and sleep disturbances.</p><p>To build positively on the existing success of the <sc>esas</sc>, a revised <sc>esas</sc> is a research priority. To establish reliability and validity, a cumulative research program will be required, particularly in the contexts of newly diagnosed patients and ambulatory care.</p></sec><sec><title>4.3 Addressing Emotional Symptoms</title><p>We conclude that the emotional components in the <sc>esas</sc> are underdeveloped and require extensive modification. Patients recently diagnosed with cancer and those undergoing treatment for cancer often suffer high levels of emotional symptoms, with many patients further developing clinical disorders of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic distress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69-co16-1-55e53">69</xref>. Many experience difficulty coping that extends into survivorship: one quarter of all cancer-free survivors suffer from psychiatric disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69-co16-1-55e53">69</xref>. A patient with cancer will not experience isolated symptoms with individual causes, but will experience a complex combination of interacting physical and emotional symptoms regardless of causation, which complicates management. When only a physiologic perspective is used, considerable difficulty arises in interpreting scores for physical symptoms. And even if the meaning of the scores are the same across patients, those patients may not report the same scores when experiencing the same level of symptoms. Some patients may not want to divulge symptoms that can jeopardize cancer treatment (for example, depression); others may want to avoid symptoms, being unable to face the mortality that such symptoms imply (emotional &#x0201c;repressors&#x0201d;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70-co16-1-55e53">70</xref>. For these reasons, each item&#x02019;s score or range of scores may have various meanings and correspondingly various implications for care. This understanding reinforces the established observation that no clear cut-offs for screening have been determined for the <sc>esas</sc> scales. The rich information that an 11-point <sc>esas</sc> scale for physical symptoms provides to the clinician would be lost by simplistic reduction to errant categories of mild, moderate, and severe, and by ignorance of the associated emotions and meaning.</p><p>To address emotional symptoms, we recommend innovation through the development of a separate tool, similar to the <sc>esas</sc>, that addresses 10 or more emotional symptoms, that uses nonpsychiatric labels, and that encompasses symptoms representing more disorders than just anxiety and depression. This new instrument would inject the <sc>esas</sc> into a theoretical framework in which physical and emotional symptoms associate for reasons of causality and interaction and for which interpretation of item values requires, at a minimum, an understanding of both physiology and psycho-emotional processes. Whether an existing &#x0201c;emotional&#x0201d; tool may be sufficient for this task is unknown. The hope is that concurrently administering a complementary pair of <sc>esas</sc>-physical and <sc>esas</sc>-emotional questionnaires could provide a more nuanced and useful interpretation for front-line staff.</p><p>The interjection of a new technology such as the <sc>esas</sc> presents methodology, resource, interpretative, scope-of-practice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71-co16-1-55e53">71</xref>, and ethical-medico-legal challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72-co16-1-55e53">72</xref>. We consider the <sc>esas</sc> to be a step in the right direction, but research regarding validity of the <sc>esas</sc> outside a palliative context is limited. Further elaboration of the <sc>esas</sc> with the goal of measuring more physical symptoms and related &#x0201c;distress,&#x0201d; and of measuring emotional symptoms are research priorities.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>5.

Data in other clinical contexts and for most languages are insufficient.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Face and content validity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Too many versions of the ESAS exist, introducing an unquantifiable concern when aggregating findings about reliability and validity across studies. The &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; ESAS is a short patient self- report that identifies some of the more common physical symptoms.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Theoretical validity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The ESAS was not psychometrically derived within a theoretical framework. It may not be feasible to &#x0201c;retrofit&#x0201d; a larger meaning to it from empiric findings. Lack of a theory makes the task of identifying constructs or predicting statistical associations difficult.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Score distributions</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Skewed distributions improve reliability because serial responses are similar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-co16-1-55e53">23</xref>, but they reduce the statistical capacity to validate the ESAS through tests of association and to establish responsiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-co16-1-55e53">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-co16-1-55e53">48</xref>. Very low symptom scores are of concern in a nonpalliative setting, in which symptom absence ranges from 22% to 81% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-co16-1-55e53">31</xref>. Scales and anchors might be adjusted to try to improve score distribution.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reliability</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Concurrent instruments give moderate-to-good correlations for physical symptoms, but lower correlations for psychological&#x02013;psychiatric items. The ESAS may be administered once daily in most palliative contexts.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Structure of the ESAS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">By Cronbach alpha and factor analyses, the ESAS may have an internal structure, with unknown nature, extent, and meaning. A summary score [ESAS&#x02013;SDS (Symptom Distress Scale)] may estimate &#x0201c;physical symptom distress.&#x0201d; Research into whether distress is the appropriate construct (for example, to determine effect on emotions and higher functions such as cognition and spirituality) is required.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Convergent and divergent validity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">More data are needed. The ESAS&#x02013;SDS targets physical symptoms and is associated with performance status, quality of life, physical well-being, and palliative care goals. The ESAS is less associated with psychological and psychiatric domains. Items of anxiety and depression have no established cut- offs for emotional&#x02013;psychological screening.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Expected statistical associations</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">This area has been poorly studied.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Responsiveness</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Responsiveness is a function of reliability and validity. Scores on the ESAS vary inconsistently with interventions. The frequency of completing the ESAS to measure change is unknown.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></floats-wrap></article>
