Introduction</title><p>Extragonadal germ cell tumors (EGGCT) accountfor approximately 2&#x02013;5% of all germcell tumors. They are mostly seen in the mediastinum and retroperitoneum. However,it can also be seen in less frequent locations such as sacrococygeal region,pineal region, prostate, orbita, liver, vagina, and gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>These lesions may grow up to extensivedimensions without any significant symptoms. The diagnosis is usually made in thethird decade. Advanced local disease and distant metastases might exist at thetime of diagnosis in the majority of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. Case Report</title><p>A 31-year-old man complaining of bilaterallumber pain, fatigue was diagnosed with right hydronephrosis on ultrasonography (US), and a double J stent was placed into the right ureter at another hospital amonth ago. He then was referred to our institution for further evaluation. Hispast medical history revealed bilateral nephrolithotomy in 1998 and rightnephrolithotomy in 1999. Physical examination of urogenital system was withinnormal limits including the scrotal examination. On admission, there was proptosis(eccentric) present displacing his right eye infero-nasally. His blood hemoglobulinand leukocyte counts were 7.81 g/dL and 21 500, respectively. Blood chemistrywas within normal limits except elevated urea (49 mg/dL) and creatinine (2.1 mg/dL) levels. Serum tumor marker studies revealed an increased beta-humanchorionic gonadotropin (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> HCG) level (37.8 mIU/mL) and an increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)level (800 IU/L). Serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level was within normal limits.</p><p>Abdominal doppler US has shown multiplebilateral renal stones, grade 2 ectasia in the left kidney and multipleirregular iso-hyperechoic hypervascular solid lesions in the right kidney. Additionally, scrotal US examination revealed no abnormalities.</p><p>On computerized tomography scans, multiple heavilycontrast-stained conglomaralated necrotic lymphadenopathies undifferentiatedfrom right kidney in paraaortic and paracaval regions and destruction of L2vertebral body were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). On magnetic resonance imaging, acontrast stained mass of 23 &#x000d7; 20 &#x000d7; 18 mm in size displacing superior andlateral orbital rectus muscles and also infiltrating into the frontal bone wasseen in the right orbita (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>).</p><p>Fine needle aspiration cytology fromretroperitoneal mass demonstrated a carcinoma associated with germ cell tumorwith positive staining for both AFP and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-HCG on immunohistochemical evaluation(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>).</p><p>The diagnosis was made as primary nonseminomatousextragonadal (retroperitoneal) germ cell tumor (EGGCT) with orbital metastasis. Chemotherapy including cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycine (BEP) wasadministered. After completion of first course chemotherapy, symptoms subsidedwith a significant reduction in proptosis. However, serum tumor marker levelsdid not change. Afterwards, a very rapid progression of the disease has occurredfollowing initial regression of his symptoms. Dimensions of orbital lesion increasedsignificantly with concomitant increase in serum tumor marker levels including AFPand <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-HCG. Unfortunately, the patient died after the second course ofchemotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec3"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>EGGCTs are rarely seen tumors with specificbiological and clinical characteristics. Symptoms depend on the location of thetumor such as presence of a palpable mass, abdominal or back pain, dysphagia, andedema in the limbs when the tumor is located in the retroperitoneum. Constitutionalsymptoms such as fever and weight loss might accompany the disease. Thediagnosis is made histopathologically when seminomatous and nonseminomatouselements of the tumor are seen on biopsy. Tumor markers are also expected toincrease if nonseminomatous elements are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In our patient, main symptoms were abdominaland low back pain. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the biopsy for AFP and HCGstaining were positive therefore, the patient was diagnosed as having extragonadalnonseminomatous germ cell tumor.</p><p>Metastases to other tissues depend on thelocalization and histological type of the primary tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Lung metastasisrate has been reported to be 27% in mediastinal nonseminomatous tumors whereasit has been reported to be 49% in retroperitoneal tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Additionally, abdominal(34%), liver (25%), and cervical lymph node (18%) metastases might also bepresent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Scrotal US could easily differentiate aretroperitoneal EGGCT from primary testicular tumor metastases without routinelyperforming testicular biopsy for differential diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The prognosis is excellent in cases withseminomatous histology regardless of the localization of the EGGCT either in mediastinumor in retroperitoneum. However, prognosis of nonseminomatous EGGCT is worsethan that of the seminomatous variant. Five-year-survival rates have beenreported to be 45% for mediastinal and 62% for retroperitoneal nonseminomatoustumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Unfortunately, the majority of patients (80%) havenonseminomatous EGGCT thus a poor prognosis which is independent of the primarylocation of the nonseminomatous EGGCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Management of patients with EGGCT is accomplishedaccording to the prognostic classification of International Germ Cell Cancer Collaboration Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Standard cisplatinum-based chemotherapy plus additional secondarysurgery in half of the patients is the recommended treatment strategy. Salvagechemotherapy including high-dose chemotherapy does not have a significantimpact on long-term survival. Regarding seminomatous tumors, 3 courses of BEP chemotherapyadministration have been suggested for patients with good prognosis, and 4courses of BEP chemotherapy have been recommended for patients with moderateprognosis. In retroperitoneal nonseminatous tumors, 3 and 4 courses of BEPchemotherapy regimen should be administered to patients with good or moderateand poor prognostic criteria, respectively. In patients with mediastinal EGGCT,4 courses of BEP chemotherapy are suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Secondary surgery is an integral part of thetreatment strategy in patients with EGGCT and is mandatory in cases withresidual mass, which is true for about 50% of the patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>We intended to treat our patient with 4 coursesof BEP chemotherapy; however, we were able to administer only two courses. Unfortunately,we lost the patient despite partial response with some regression in thediameter of the orbital mass without any change in serum tumor marker levels.</p><p>In our case, a right orbital mass accompanyingthe retroperitoneal tumor which we think was metastasis rather than anotherprimary focus regressed after the administration of first course of BEPchemotherapy. Because the volume of the orbital tumor mass was smaller than thevolume of the retroperitoneal tumor, we think that orbital tumor regressed tosome degree while the retroperitoneal mass remained unchanged without anychange in serum tumor marker levels.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Goss</surname><given-names>PE</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwertfeger</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Blackstein</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Extragonadal germ cell tumors.
