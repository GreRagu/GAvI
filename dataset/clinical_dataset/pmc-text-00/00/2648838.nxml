Resistance in SW620 cells was overcome by exogenous ceramide leading us to propose that defective ceramide signaling contributes to TRAIL resistance. In this study we found that the increase in C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide in SW480 cells was inhibited by fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthases (CerS). Protein analysis revealed that TRAIL resistant SW620 cells expressed lower levels of ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6, also known as longevity assurance homologue 6), which prompted us to investigate the effect of CerS6 modulation on TRAIL phenotype. RNAi against CerS6 resulted in a specific and significant decrease of the C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide species, which was sufficient to inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In cells with decreased levels of CerS6, caspase-3 was activated but failed to translocate into the nucleus. CerS6 localized primarily to the perinuclear region, suggesting this enzyme may play a role in regulation of nuclear permeability. Moderate elevation in CerS6 expression was sufficient to reverse TRAIL resistance in SW620 cells. These results suggest that modulation of CerS6 expression may constitute a new therapeutic strategy to alter apoptotic susceptibility.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>TRAIL</kwd><kwd>ceramide</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>ceramide</kwd><kwd>synthase</kwd><kwd>longevity assurance homologue (LASS)</kwd></kwd-group><contract-num rid="DE1">R01 DE016572-04||DE</contract-num><contract-num rid="CA1">R01 CA088932-07||CA</contract-num><contract-num rid="RR1">P20 RR017698-03||RR</contract-num><contract-num rid="RR1">P20 RR017698-02||RR</contract-num><contract-num rid="RR1">P20 RR017698-01||RR</contract-num><contract-num rid="CA1">P01 CA097132-060004||CA</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="DE1">National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research : NIDCR</contract-sponsor><contract-sponsor id="CA1">National Cancer Institute : NCI</contract-sponsor><contract-sponsor id="RR1">National Center for Research Resources : NCRR</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand) is a death receptor ligand of the TNF superfamily that can selectively kill cancer cells without toxicity towards normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">de Jong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Wiley et al., 1995</xref>). Systemic administration of recombinant TRAIL has recently been deemed safe in a Phase I clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ashkenazi &#x00026; Herbst, 2008</xref>). Unfortunately, not all malignant cells are susceptible to the apoptotic effects of TRAIL and new strategies to enhance TRAIL-mediated killing of tumor cells are an area of intense investigation. Identification of mechanisms that lead to resistance has a critical two-fold purpose: (1) to facilitate stratification of tumors likely to respond to TRAIL therapy and (2) to develop therapeutic strategies to overcome TRAIL resistance. TRAIL induces apoptosis by binding to agonistic TRAIL receptors (DR4/TRAIL-R1 and/or DR5/TRAIL-R2) followed by activation of initiator caspases and subsequent (mitochondria-dependent or &#x02013;independent) activation of effector caspases-3 and &#x02212;7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Koschny et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">MacFarlane, 2003</xref>).

Numerous proteins such as cFLIP, anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, and IAP&#x02019;s can negatively regulate the apoptotic signal at or upstream of caspase-3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dohi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Peter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Sharpe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Wiley et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Sphingolipids have also been shown to influence apoptotic responses. The sphingolipid ceramide in particular has been associated with antiproliferative responses such as growth arrest, senescence, differentiation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ogretmen &#x00026; Hannun, 2004</xref>). Data obtained by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS), which allows study of specific ceramide species suggests that generation of C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide is specifically involved in apoptotic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kroesen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Thomas et al., 1999</xref>). We have recently shown that the isogenic colon cancer cell lines SW480 and SW620 are sensitive and resistant to TRAIL, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Voelkel-Johnson et al., 2005</xref>). Our data indicated that differences in TRAIL sensitivity may be related to differences in sphingolipid metabolism. TRAIL sensitive SW480 cells had higher basal levels of C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide, which further increased in response to TRAIL. We also demonstrated that exogenous C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide, which is most likely metabolized to C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ogretmen et al., 2002</xref>), sensitized resistant SW620 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis but failed to further enhance TRAIL sensitivity in SW480 cells, suggesting that in these cells sufficient endogenous ceramide was available to achieve a maximal apoptotic response. We hypothesized that exogenous ceramide corrects a defect in sphingolipid metabolism present only in resistant and not sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Voelkel-Johnson et al., 2005</xref>). Here we extended our previous study and identified ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6 also known as longevity assurance homolog 6/LASS6), which preferentially generates C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide, as a novel protein that can influence TRAIL susceptibility. RNAi against CerS6 resulted in a specific decrease in intracellular C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide and protected SW480 cells against TRAIL-mediated apoptosis while increasing CerS6 expression sensitized SW620 cells to TRAIL. Downregulation of CerS6 did not interfere with caspase activation but appears to inhibit translocation of activated caspase-3 into the nucleus. Our data suggest that CerS6 may regulate events at the nuclear membrane and allow late stage apoptotic signaling, exemplified by activated caspase 3, to proceed into the nucleus. This finding posits that CerS6 holds a novel position in the apoptotic pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell Lines and Culture</title><p id="P4">The cell lines SW480 and SW620 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD).

In this study, we initially expanded the time course to determine whether changes in C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide can be detected at later time points in resistant cells. As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, even 22 hours after TRAIL treatment, intracellular C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide levels remain unchanged in resistant SW620 cells. In contrast, C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide levels continue to increase in a time-dependent manner in TRAIL sensitive SW480 cells. In SW480 cells, the increase in C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide was accompanied by a decrease in intracellular sphingosine (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These data indicated the possible involvement of ceramide synthases (CerS), which utilize sphinganine or sphingosine as substrates to generate dihydroceramide or ceramide in the de novo or salvage pathway of sphingolipid synthesis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Ogretmen &#x00026; Hannun, 2004</xref>). To further investigate the possible role of CerS, we used the inhibitor fumonison B1 (FB1). As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, pretreatment with FB1 for 2 hours significantly inhibited the TRAIL-induced increase in C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide. We also observed accumulation of both sphinganine and sphingosine in SW480 cells treated with FB1 and TRAIL (data not shown). In summary, these data suggested that CerS are stimulated upon TRAIL treatment in SW480 cells.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>SW480 and SW620 differ in expression of CerS6</title><p id="P16">In humans, six CerS homologues have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mizutani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Pewzner-Jung et al., 2006</xref>). These gene products synthesize ceramide with a high degree of fatty acid specificity. For example, overexpression of CerS4/LASS4/TRH-1 corresponded to increased C<sub>18</sub>-, C<sub>20</sub>- and C<sub>22</sub>-ceramide synthesis, whereas overexpression of CerS5/LASS5/TRH-4 resulted in increased generation of C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Riebeling et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Venkataraman et al., 2002</xref>). The CerS homologues 5 and 6 were of particular interest for this study, since both preferentially generate C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide and we previously observed a selective increase in this ceramide species during TRAIL induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mizutani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Riebeling et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Voelkel-Johnson et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, CerS6 is expressed at relatively high levels in intestinal tissue (pers. comm., Dr. Anthony Futerman, Weizman Institute, Israel). In order to characterize and compare CerS5 and CerS6 expression, we performed real-time PCR and expressed mRNA levels in SW620 cells relative to levels in SW480 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Little difference was observed (less than 2-fold), which may be explained by a recent finding that SW620 cells have global alterations in their ability to translate mRNA and suggests that mRNA levels may not properly reflect protein expression in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Provenzani et al., 2006</xref>). CerS6 protein expression was evaluated by western blotting using a commercially available antibody (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). We found that CerS6 expression in SW620 cells was much lower than in SW480 cells, which is consistent with a lack of correlation between CerS6 mRNA and protein in SW620 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).

CerS6 protein was decreased but not completely abrogated in each of the three experiments performed (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Since the siRNA efficiently decreases CerS6 mRNA (data not shown), residual protein expression is indicative of a long protein half-life.

Analysis of chromatin condensation and nuclear degradation by Hoechst staining revealed that TRAIL treatment of SW480 cells transfected with the control siRNA resulted in chromatin condensation and fragmentation of the nucleus into a grape-like appearance, which is consistent with apoptotic morphology (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).

A decrease in CerS6 resulted only in inhibition of PARP cleavage. PARP is a known target of caspase-3 and therefore we wished to verify that the cleaved form of caspase-3 detected by Western blot was functionally active. However, downregulation of CerS6 did not result in significant differences in caspase-3/7 activity following TRAIL treatment (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). To confirm these results, we generated SW480 cells that stably expressed a CerS6 shRNA against a different target sequence than the siRNA.

To test this hypothesis we used the FLICA-DEVD assay, in which a fluorochrome caspase inhibitor binds to active caspases-3/7. In TRAIL treated cells transfected with scrambled siRNA, evidence of active caspase-3/7 coincided with visible nuclear condensation (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">suppl.Fig 4</xref>). In contrast, in TRAIL treated cells transfected with CerS6 siRNA we observed cells in which the rhodamine signal was not accompanied by nuclear condensation. To quantitate the amount of active caspase-3 translocating into the nucleus, isolated nuclei were incubated with a FITC-conjugated antibody specific for active caspase-3 followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, the amount of active caspase-3 in nuclei of cells transfected with CerS6 siRNA was near baseline after TRAIL treatment and significantly less than in nuclei isolated from TRAIL-treated cells transfected with control siRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that deficiency in CerS6 expression inhibits the ability of active caspase-3 to translocate into the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="S20"><title>Exogenous CerS6 localizes primarily to the perinuclear region</title><p id="P21">Ceramide synthases have been identified as proteins that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kitatani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mizutani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Riebeling et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Senkal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Venkataraman et al., 2002</xref>). The membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus are continuous and since our results suggested a role for CerS6 in mediating caspase-3 translocation through the nuclear membrane, we were interested in determining the subcellular location of CerS6 in SW480 cells. Detection of endogenous CerS6 was hampered by non-specific signals from the LASS6 (CerS6) antibody. Thus, we transiently transfected SW480 cells with a plasmid that expresses CerS6 with an N-terminal FLAG-tag. We probed for the FLAG-tag as well as Lamin B, calreticulin, and the nuclear stain DRAQ5. In SW480 cells, Lamin B however did not localize to the nuclear membrane (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">suppl. Fig 5</xref>). Calreticulin, a protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum did co-localize with FLAG-tagged CerS6 but the pattern did not completely overlap. In agreement with a previous study investigating the intracellular location of CerS6, we found that the majority of the protein was detected in the perinuclear region (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mizutani et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Upregulation of CerS6 in SW620 cells results in TRAIL sensitivity</title><p id="P22">The difference in TRAIL sensitivity between SW480 and SW620 cells does not appear to be mediated by significant alterations to levels of pro- or anti-apoptotic proteins with the possible exception of XIAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Huerta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Ndozangue-Touriguine et al., 2008</xref>). However, in our cells we did not observe elevated expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as cFLIP, Bcl-2 or XIAP that would explain the TRAIL resistant phenotype of SW620 cells (<xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">suppl. Fig. 6</xref>). Having observed that the downregulation of CerS6 generates a TRAIL-resistant phenotype in TRAIL sensitive SW480 cells, we investigated whether SW620 cells, which are TRAIL resistant and have reduced CerS6 expression, could be sensitized by increasing levels of CerS6. We generated a plasmid encoding CerS6 and EGFP separated by an IRES sequence, which allows the expression of two proteins from one mRNA, so that GFP serves as an indicator for transfected cells. SW620 cells were transfected with a control plasmid (pIRES2-EGFP) or pCerS6-IRES2-EGFP. Untreated and TRAIL treated cells were then analyzed morphologically. CerS6 over-expression alone did not induce morphological changes associated with apoptosis (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). However, when cells transfected with pCerS6-IRES2-EGFP were treated with TRAIL, GFP positive cells appeared to be undergoing apoptosis (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>, arrows). Some GFP-negative cells also appeared apoptotic, indicating a possible bystander effect that may be mediated by a high local ceramide concentration.</p><p id="P23">SW620 cells transfect poorly and in order to perform a more detailed analysis of an entire cell population, we generated stable transfectants. The amount of CerS6 expression was moderately elevated in these cells, indicating that high levels of CerS6 expression may result in a survival disadvantage (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). Consistent with the morphological observation following transient transfection, cells stably transfected with CerS6 but not with the empty plasmid acquired a TRAIL sensitive phenotype (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). The TRAIL sensitive phenotype was confirmed by PARP cleavage (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S22"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P24">The goal of this study was to extend our original observation that isogenic TRAIL sensitive and resistant cells differed in basal and induced generation of ceramide, which had led to our hypothesis that TRAIL resistant cells have defects in sphingolipid metabolism. In this study we found that the TRAIL-induced increase in intracellular C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide was accompanied by a decrease in sphingosine, leading us to investigate the potential involvement of ceramide synthases. We were specifically interested in further studying CerS5 and CerS6, which are the two CerS family member that preferentially generate C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide but found that mRNA levels of these enzymes did not differ significantly between the cell lines. We were unable to study endogenous CerS5 due to lack of antibodies but found that CerS6 protein expression was reduced in TRAIL resistant SW620 cells. We demonstrated that RNAi against CerS6 results in a specific decrease in C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide and that this decrease was sufficient to result in TRAIL resistance.</p><p id="P25">Ceramide has been shown to play a role in multiple subcellular compartments during apoptosis. At the plasma membrane, ceramide generation is involved in aggregation of surface receptors into &#x0201c;ceramide-enriched platforms&#x0201d;, which results in more efficient transduction of death receptor signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Cremesti et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gulbins &#x00026; Kolesnick, 2003</xref>). At the mitochondria, ceramide plays an important role in Bax oligomer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Birbes et al., 2005</xref>). Thus we were surprised to find that CerS6 downregulation did not appear to interfere with caspase-3 activation, which functions downstream of events at the plasma membrane and mitochondria. The only other protein reported to interfere with apoptosis downstream of caspase-3/7 activation is Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Jaattela et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Our data suggested that reduced levels of CerS6 interfere with translocation of active caspase-3 into the nucleus. The nuclear envelope consists of a double membrane containing nuclear pore complexes responsible for selectively exchanging material between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Tran &#x00026; Wente, 2006</xref>). An earlier study revealed that inhibition of nuclear transport by microinjection of wheat-germ agglutinin inhibits Fas-induced apoptosis and caspase-3-induced nuclear changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Yasuhara et al., 1997</xref>). It is known that active caspase-3 enters the nucleus during apoptosis but the mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood. One study suggested that the diffusion limits of nuclear pores are increased by activated caspase-9 during apoptosis to allow passive import of caspase-3 fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Faleiro &#x00026; Lazebnik, 2000</xref>). The hypothesis that active caspase-3 enters the nucleus by passive diffusion was supported by Beckman et al. who found that active caspase-3 degrades POM, a protein which anchors nuclear pores, and a number of nuclear porins such as Nup153, Nup93, and Nup96, thereby destabilizing the pores and creating leakiness in the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Beckman et al., 2004</xref>). Another group found that active caspase-3 is transported into the nucleus by a specific mechanism and later identified A-kinase-anchoring protein 95 (AKAP95) as a potential carrier of active caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kamada et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Kamada et al., 2005b</xref>). CerS6-generated C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide may influence the mechanisms responsible for active transport of caspase-3 into the nucleus or could directly influences the permeability of the nuclear membrane by increasing pore size. It has been demonstrated that nucleocytoplasmic transport is altered early during apoptosis as evidenced by increased permeability to larger size dextrans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Ferrando-May et al., 2001</xref>) but whether ceramide plays a role in this process is unknown. The ratio of ceramide to dihydroceramide, its precursor in the de novo pathway, can control the formation of pores in micelles and organelles, thus it is possible that cells with reduced basal C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide or the inability to generate C<sub>16</sub>-ceramide in response to apoptotic stimuli have impaired pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Siskind &#x00026; Colombini, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Stiban et al., 2008</xref>). The observation that transfected CerS6 primarily localizes to the perinuclear region (this study and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mizutani et al., 2005</xref>)) and that downregulation of CerS6 results in a lesion downstream of caspase-3 but upstream of nuclear condensation and PARP cleavage warrants further investigation of a possible role of CerS6 and/or its products in regulation of nucleocytoplasmic exchange. The development of antibodies that detect endogenous CerS6 by immunostaining will be useful to further explore the role of CerS6 in the perinuclear region. The general idea that membrane permeability plays a role in TRAIL-induced apoptosis has been examined recently in the context of leukemic T-cells, in which heat shock and alcohol treatments were used as methods to increase membrane fluidity. Both treatments resulted in sensitization to TRAIL, which could be completely abrogated by inhibiting the ceramide generation resulting from heat shock and alcohol treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Moulin et al., 2007</xref>). Although the sensitization methods used are not entirely specific to membrane fluidity, the results support the idea that the TRAIL apoptotic signal is strengthened by ceramide and that membrane changes are part of the enhancement.</p><p id="P27">Inhibitor studies have shown that ceramide synthases are required for apoptosis induced by androgen ablation, oxidative stress, taxol, daunorubicin, and radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Basnakian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bose et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Charles et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Eto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Garzotto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Ueda et al., 2001</xref>). However, since cloning of CerS, only LASS1/CerS1 has been studied with regard to apoptosis in cancer. Alterations in CerS1 and its product C<sub>18</sub>-ceramide have previously been reported to play a role in the regulation of HNSCC pathogenesis and therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Karahatay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Koybasi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Senkal et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting the possibility that other members of the CerS family play similar, yet specific roles in other cancer types or tissues. For example, LASS5/CerS5 is important in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Xu et al., 2005</xref>) and CerS6 is highly expressed in intestinal tissue (pers. comm., Dr. Anthony Futerman, Weizman Institute, Israel). Since ceramide levels are significantly lower in colon tumors compared to the surrounding normal mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Selzner et al., 2001</xref>), it will be interesting to determine whether this decrease is associated with altered expression of ceramide synthases. We have shown that a moderate increase in CerS6 expression is sufficient for reversing TRAIL resistance. Therefore, our data suggest that restoring CerS6 expression may constitute a new therapeutic strategy for enhancing TRAIL sensitivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S23"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS80120-supplement-1.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="N0x7463780N0x855d090" position="anchor" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>2</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS80120-supplement-2.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="N0x7463780N0x855d150" position="anchor" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>3</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS80120-supplement-3.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="N0x7463780N0x855d210" position="anchor" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>4</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS80120-supplement-4.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="N0x7463780N0x855d2d0" position="anchor" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>5</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS80120-supplement-5.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="N0x7463780N0x855d390" position="anchor" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>6</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS80120-supplement-6.tif" xlink:type="simple" id="N0x7463780N0x855d450" position="anchor" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="S24" sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Table</title><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Sphingolipid responses to TRAIL.
