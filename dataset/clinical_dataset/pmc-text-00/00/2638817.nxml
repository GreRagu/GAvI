We have demonstrated the involvement of different cognitive processes in AP ability that reflects varying skill expertise in the presence of similar early age of onset of music tuition. These processes were related to different regions of brain activity, including those involved in pitch working memory (right prefrontal cortex) and the long-term representation of pitch (superior temporal gyrus). They reflected expertise through the use of context dependent pitch cues and the level of automaticity of pitch naming. They impart functional significance to structural asymmetry differences in the planum temporale of musicians and establish a neurobiological basis for an AP template. More generally, they indicate variability of knowledge representation in the presence of environmental fostering of early cognitive development that translates to differences in cognitive ability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>functional neuroimaging</kwd><kwd>musical skill expertise</kwd><kwd>pitch identification</kwd><kwd>planum temporale</kwd><kwd>relative pitch perception</kwd><kwd>structural neuroimaging</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The skill of perfect or absolute pitch (AP) is typically defined as the ability to identify a pitch (e.g., the musical note C) without using a reference tone. It is commonly associated with the commencement of early musical training during a sensitive period of development, with genetic influences also playing a significant role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zatorre 2003</xref>). It is an important ability to study because it can inform us about interactions between genes and the environment, and specifically how tuition during a sensitive period may lead to changes in brain structure and function that underpin the development of knowledge representations and behavioral skills.</p><p>The acquisition of AP may be considered a deviation from the typical development of relative pitch (RP) ability that is used by the majority of individuals to process the relations between tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Trehub 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Trehub and Hannon 2006</xref>). Previous research has suggested that AP is an inherited autosomal dominant trait, with strong support for familial aggregation of AP after controlling for early musical training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Profita and Bidder 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baharloo et al. 2000</xref>). The penetrance of AP may be influenced by the presence and type of early musical training, implying that in genetically predisposed individuals, the brain may be &#x0201c;particularly amenable to the establishment of new circuits or to the fine-tuning of preexisting circuits involved in pitch perception&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baharloo et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gregersen et al. 2001</xref>). Although reasons for undertaking musical training may in part reflect genetic predisposition, the impact of the environment and in particular, the role of a sensitive period in the development of neural changes has not yet been fully determined.</p><p>A 2-component model of AP ability has been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Levitin (1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levitin and Rogers 2005</xref>). The first component entails absolute representation of pitch in long-term memory that appears common to all humans and some other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Terhardt and Ward 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Halpern 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saffran and Griepentrog 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deutsch 2002</xref>). The second component involves pitch labeling, typically using a verbal code that may be acquired from training during the sensitive period in select individuals. This component has been proposed to involve conditional associative memory, with tones organized in nominal categories with up to 70 categories identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zatorre 2003</xref>). The model is hierarchical in that the first component constitutes a prerequisite for the second. In AP possessors, AP representation may be integrated with the verbal code, creating a unique pitch template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levitin and Rogers 2005</xref>).</p><p>Research has begun to address the neurobiological basis of this model. Functional neuroimaging findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zatorre et al. (1998)</xref> pointed to the importance of left dorsolateral frontal cortex in supporting conditional verbal-pitch associations in AP possessors while listening to tones (an implicit pitch naming task). This task also engaged frontotemporal auditory working memory processes (pitch and verbal) presumably to support the retention of tones &#x0201c;in mind&#x0201d; while associating their verbal labels. Because left dorsolateral frontal cortex has been activated in nonmusicians during a conditional pitch association task, one interpretation is that there is no difference in the brains of musicians with or without AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bermudez and Zatorre 2005</xref>).</p><p>Structural neuroimaging research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schlaug et al. (1995)</xref> has implicated a region in the posterior superior temporal gyrus, the planum temporale, based on greater left-right asymmetry in AP musicians compared with musicians without AP and normal controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Keenan et al. 2001</xref>). The degree of activation of the left planum temporale has been correlated with the age of onset of musical training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ohnishi et al. 2001</xref>), and it has been proposed to be important in matching spectrotemporal patterns with stored patterns or templates of previously experienced sound objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Griffiths and Warren 2002</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Griffiths and Warren (2002)</xref> have likened the planum temporale to a &#x0201c;computational hub,&#x0201d; allowing abstraction of properties of complex sounds for further analysis by higher cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Griffiths and Warren 2002</xref>). Taken together, these findings point to a possible role of the planum temporale in the long-term representation of pitch (&#x0201c;AP template&#x0201d;). In light of Zatorre's research, however, there is a need to directly assess the functional neurobiological correlates of this notion. To achieve this in the current study we investigated the sights of activation along the anterior&#x02013;posterior extent of the superior temporal gyrus during an explicit pitch naming task.</p><p>A key conceptual challenge to studying individuals with unique cognitive abilities is the identification of an appropriate reference group. Examining a group who lack the skill poses difficulties for interpretation because these individuals are presumably unable to perform the task. Traditionally, AP has been contrasted with RP perception, however more recent research has suggested that these 2 skills lie on a continuum with &#x0201c;quasi-absolute pitch&#x0201d; (QAP) falling in between (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levitin and Rogers 2005</xref>). Because QAP shows variability in the behavioral phenotype and its level of dependence on the auditory context for pitch cues, it provides a crucial but underutilized paradigm for addressing this issue.</p><p>Our first aim was to assess functional involvement of the planum temporale in AP ability. We developed an explicit in-scanner pitch naming task using measures of response accuracy and reaction time after subtracting conditional association and auditory working memory processes. We hypothesized that the long-term representation of AP engages an AP template as evident from activation of the posterior superior temporal gyrus and structural asymmetry of the planum temporale. We further postulated that variability in this template would account for behavioral variability in AP ability. Thus, our second question examined whether functional activation and structural measures of the planum temporale differed for the AP and QAP groups. We predicted that QAP musicians would engage additional neurocognitive processes to assist their more limited AP template, as reflected by their lesser AP skill.</p><p>Although RP is common to all individuals, previous research has suggested that the automatic nature of AP may interfere with RP judgments in AP possessors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Miyazaki and Rakowski 2002</xref>). The neurocognitive basis of any interference afforded by dual representations has not been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zatorre 2003</xref>). Thus, our third question examined patterns of cerebral activity associated with RP ability in the same musicians with varying AP, as well as a group of musicians with RP. We also assessed the presence of structural differences in the planum temporale of these RP musicians.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>One hundred and twenty-five musicians were recruited from the community and tertiary education settings, and underwent neurological and psychiatric screening, and audiometry for the presence of significant hearing loss.

The musicians were required to identify a series of 50 randomized piano tones by their musical note names (pitch chroma) without feedback of the accuracy of their responses. The tones were selected from the equal tempered scale, ranging from C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>5</sub> (concert pitch A<sub>4</sub> 440 Hz, American notation) and proportionally distributed across the black and white notes of the piano. Each tone had a duration of 500 ms, followed by an interval of 2.5-s response time (1 stimulus = 3 s). The piano tones were synthesized using a &#x0201c;stereo grand&#x0201d; piano timbre of a Yamaha S80, 88-note fully weighted keyboard, linked to a G4 Apple Macintosh computer (Mac OS 8.6). Pro Tools LE software (5.0, Digidesign, Daly City, CA) was used to assemble the stimuli, which were binaurally presented to the musicians via loud speakers at a comfortable listening level in an auditory laboratory. For both the out-of-scanner and in-scanner AP tasks, a piano timbre was used to capture variability in AP ability. In accordance with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Takeuchi and Hulse 1993</xref>), musicians were classified as having AP if &#x02265;90% of the tones were correctly identified, whereas those identifying &#x02264;20% were considered to lack AP ability (RP group). Those falling in between were classified as QAP musicians. Correct pitch identification did not require accurate octave classification and semitone errors were coded as incorrect for all participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive Activation Paradigm</title><p>Three types of stimuli were created: noise bursts, piano tones, and piano chords. These were binaurally presented to the musicians during scanning via Ear Tone 3A earplugs at a comfortable listening level. A microphone was used to communicate with the musicians, including delivery of task instructions. The stimuli were played via a Pro 2 stereo audio mixer linked to a PC running stimulus presentation software written in Matlab (5.0, MathWorks, Novi, MI). In each task, a total of 54 stimulus pairs were presented (18 per scan) with an interstimulus interval of 5 s. Participant responses were recorded on a Sony Digital Audio Tape-corder machine (TCD-D10 PRO, Sony, San Diego, CA) to measure response accuracy and reaction time.</p><p>For the baseline task, pairs of noise bursts comprised 250 ms of silence, 1 s of noise burst, 250 ms of silence, and 500 ms of noise burst. Noise bursts consisted of white noise with similar onset/offset characteristics to the piano tones and chords, and were created using the &#x0201c;wvnoise&#x0201d; timbre of the S80 keyboard. The baseline task was designed to subtract activation associated with basic auditory and linguistic processing, including conditional association and auditory working memory processes at relatively low processing load. During scanning, the musicians were required to listen carefully to each pair of noise bursts and respond with the words &#x0201c;C natural.&#x0201d;</p><p>Piano chord and tone pairs for the 2 activation tasks comprised 250 ms of silence, 1 s of arpeggiated piano chord, 250 ms of silence, and 500 ms of piano tone. They were created using the &#x0201c;stereo grand&#x0201d; piano timbre of the S80 keyboard, and were randomly distributed across the equal tempered scale (C<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>5</sub>). For the in-scanner AP task (&#x0201c;pitch naming&#x0201d;) the musicians were presented with an arpeggiated chord of octaves followed by a tone of the same pitch (the target tone) and required to identify this tone using its full musical note name (e.g., &#x0201c;C natural&#x0201d;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1<italic>a</italic></xref>). If they did not recognize the tone, they said &#x0201c;pass&#x0201d; and moved on to the next item.

Piano chords were distributed across each major key within the range of G#<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>4</sub> of the equal tempered scale, with random modulation of items within this range promoting RP processing. During training, the participants were instructed to identify condition 1) as &#x0201c;tonal&#x0201d; and condition 2) as &#x0201c;atonal.&#x0201d; If they were unsure, they said &#x0201c;pass&#x0201d; and moved on to the next item.</p><p>The tonal classification task was derived from the well-established probe-tone technique, that is paradigmatic of RP processing tasks in the tonal idiom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Krumhansl 1991</xref>). Although AP possessors may perform RP tasks using pitch labeling, the tonal classification task favored a RP processing strategy by promoting a global tonality judgment. In particular, it required the listener to perform an interval judgment between the second last note and the last note of the item within the tonal context established by the preceding intervals of the arpeggiated sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1<italic>b</italic></xref>). An interval of one semitone (leading note to tonic) created a sense of tonal resolution (&#x0201c;tonal&#x0201d; condition), whereas the interval of a whole tone left the sequence unresolved (&#x0201c;atonal&#x0201d; condition). In other words, the tonal classification task was purposely designed to be similar to the pitch naming task with the exception that the pitch naming task required an AP judgment labeled according to note name, whereas the tonal classification task favored a RP judgment labeled according to the degree to which the sequence conformed with the Western tonal idiom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Similar to the baseline task, the tonal classification task also allowed subtraction of basic auditory and linguistic processing, conditional verbal-pitch associations, and auditory working memory functions.</p><p>Initial analysis of the behavioral data revealed that they were suitable for parametric analyses that were performed using SPSS 11 (SPSS, Chicago, IL), with <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 (2-tailed) set as the criterion of statistical significance.

Each musician underwent 9 PET scans following the bolus injection of the blood flow tracer [<sup>15</sup>O]H<sub>2</sub>O with an interval of at least 10 min between scans. The total effective dose equivalent of radioactivity for the entire study was less than 5.0 mSv for each participant. Integrated radioactivity counts accumulated over a 60-s acquisition period beginning with the rising phase of head counts was used as an index of perfusion. Three scans were performed for the baseline task and 3 for each of the activation tasks. Performance commenced 30 s before the start of scan acquisition and continued throughout the entire scanning period. Prior to scanning the musicians received training on each task to ensure that they fully understood the task requirements. High-resolution <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>-weighted spoiled gradient echo magnetic resonance (MR) scans (time repetition 35 ms, time echo 7 ms, flip angle 35&#x000b0;, field of view 24 cm) comprising 120 contiguous slices of 1-mm thickness and 1 mm &#x000d7; 1 mm pixel dimension were also acquired in each musician.</p><p>For each PET study, subsequent PET images were aligned to the first to correct for head movement between scans using automated image registration software. Both MR and PET images were then stereotactically normalized using an automated algorithm at progressively higher resolutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Talairach and Tourneaux 1988</xref>). Images were blurred with a 16-mm full width at half maximum Gaussian filter to correct for anatomical differences between participants. PET activation data were analyzed using the general linear model (SPM2, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, UK), and a statistical parametric map of the <italic>t</italic>-statistic for the regression coefficient was generated using contrasts to investigate specific effects. These contrasts were guided by the findings from the behavioral data collected during scanning.

Significant activation associated with this region appeared dependent on high levels of skill expertise, with less skilled performance engaging a right hemisphere network including pitch working memory structures. The automaticity of pitch naming conferred a disadvantage on RP processing speed that may be underpinned by activation of proximal regions in the left superior temporal gyrus. The functional imaging findings were supported by structural asymmetry of the planum temporale that was most evident in the AP musicians despite an early age of onset of musical training in both the AP and QAP groups.</p><p>We believe the findings highlight the utility of investigating individuals with partial representations to gain insight into the neurobiological complexities underpinning knowledge formation. Our goal was to investigate differences in AP ability, and thus we chose methods that allowed us to probe these differences (i.e., use of a piano timbre to examine pitch naming in AP and QAP musicians). Previous research has generally excluded individuals with QAP or used sine tones to examine pitch naming, in effect removing variability that naturally exists in the population (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Athos et al. 2007</xref>). Arguably, this has led to a restricted understanding of the mechanisms underpinning AP skill, to which we believe the current study sheds important insights. In particular, by systematically examining variable pitch naming ability we have identified component neurocognitive processes that are differentially involved in the representation of pitch. These processes are underscored by changes in brain structure and function that were reflected by our in-scanner behavioral performance measures. Conceivably these changes are the expression of complex interactions between early learning experiences and genetic predispositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zatorre 2003</xref>).</p><p>First, high pitch naming accuracy associated with faster response times for AP over RP judgments showed principal involvement of the left hemisphere, indicated by a more posterior peak along the anterior&#x02013;posterior extent of the left superior temporal gyrus. Our in-scanner pitch naming task was purposely designed to remove cerebral blood flow changes previously attributed to conditional associative and auditory working memory processes in frontal regions of the brain. This allowed examination of the functional role of the left posterior superior temporal gyrus in the long-term representation of pitch. Interestingly, in the majority of AP musicians peak activation fell on the bank of the superior temporal gyrus, abutting the superior temporal sulcus. The superior temporal sulcus has been generally implicated in the integration of multimodal sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Noppeney et al. 2007</xref>) and more specifically, in different levels of pitch pattern analysis that may be relevant to linguistic prosody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stewart et al. 2008</xref>). Thus our findings are consistent with the notion that high pitch naming accuracy may be supported by a unique pitch template, where the verbal code is integrated with the AP representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levitin and Rogers 2005</xref>). In our study, the decreased volume of the right planum temporale of AP musicians is consistent with activation of the left posterior superior temporal gyrus during pitch naming (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Keenan et al. 2001</xref>). It implies a reduced role for the homologous region in the right hemisphere in individuals with a high degree of skill automaticity. This automaticity conferred a RP processing disadvantage in AP musicians, with engagement of pitch naming requiring translation for successful RP judgments in some AP musicians. This may account for the slower RP response times of the AP musicians.</p><p>Second, a more limited AP template was associated with more extensive recruitment of neuronal networks, particularly in the right hemisphere. This appeared commensurate with the extent to which QAP musicians used auditory working memory strategies. The use of reference tones by QAP musicians and the salience of tones C, G, and A, have been previously well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Miyazaki 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Takeuchi and Hulse 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Athos et al. 2007</xref>). Research has also shown engagement of pitch working memory processes by less expert musicians associated with activation of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zatorre et al. 1994</xref>). The use of pitch working memory has recently been proposed as a marker of lower AP skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ross et al. 2004</xref>). The current study brings these findings together by demonstrating peak activation in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in QAP musicians principally employing a reference tone strategy.</p><p>In addition to the use of reference tones, the behavioral data support previous findings that QAP is facilitated by a range of auditory cues, including timbre, key color, and pitch register or height (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachem 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Takeuchi and Hulse 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Athos et al. 2007</xref>). In the present study, this may have been associated with activation of the right superior temporal gyrus previously shown to be important in fine-grained spectral processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Griffiths and Warren 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stewart et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Griffiths et al. 2007</xref>). In particular, activation of the more posterior extent of the right superior temporal gyrus in QAP musicians suggests involvement of this homologous region in pitch representation. This is consistent with the significantly larger mean right planum temporale volume of the QAP musicians. This finding is intriguing, and warrants further investigation. One possibility is that QAP reflects a more limited AP template that is more reliant on the presence of contextual cues during perceptual encoding. The nature of these cues may reflect experiences from early musical training, including exposure to white notes before the black notes of the piano, typically in a restricted pitch range. In other words, general plasticity effects associated with an early age of musical training per se cannot account for the volume differences observed in AP and QAP musicians. Rather, a more limited AP template appears dependent on contextual cues that may be present during early training and may be associated with structural differences in the organization of long-term pitch representation.</p><p>Third, we found activation of the more anterior extent of the left superior temporal gyrus during RP processing in musicians with or without AP. Previous research has implicated this region in RP processing including the detection of violations of tonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Janata et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Warren et al. 2003</xref>), with tracking of tonal space maintained by regions in the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Janata et al. 2002</xref>). Our tonal classification task required identification of intervals conforming to the Western tonal idiom after subtraction of auditory working memory processes, and thus our findings are in keeping with this previous research. They also contribute new data on the possibility of a proximal, dual representation of absolute and RP in AP possessors, potentially accounting for the RP performance disadvantage of AP musicians and previous suggestions of an integrated representation of AP and interval information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levitin and Rogers 2005</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the study findings are based on converging effects from a number of methodological approaches. There were clear differences in the volumes of the right planum temporale of the musicians with AP, QAP, and RP. These differences were accompanied by different patterns of functional activation observed for the AP and QAP musicians on the pitch naming task. The AP musicians showed a smaller right planum temporale and unilateral left-sided activation in the more posterior extent of the superior temporal gyrus during pitch naming. In contrast, the QAP musicians showed symmetry of the planum temporale and greater activation of the right superior temporal gyrus during pitch naming. These effects were associated with clear differences in task performance at a behavioral level. Taken together, one explanation of these congruent findings is plasticity of auditory knowledge representation in the context of environmental fostering of early cognitive development that translates to differences in cognitive ability. Arguably this involves long-term cortical changes at a system level impacting brain structure, function, and behavior.</p><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides new insights into the spectrum of neurocognitive processes that may underpin absolute and RP processing. Central to our findings is the establishment of a neurobiological basis for an AP template in the temporal lobe. More broadly, our findings illustrate the importance of systematically examining variability in musical skill expertise to provide an integrated account of pitch processing in the brain. This account informs our understanding of the development of knowledge and cognitive skills and their cerebral representation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><grant-sponsor>Australian
