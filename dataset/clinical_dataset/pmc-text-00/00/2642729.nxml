Many strains of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> are resistant to killing by the human complement system, which is present at up to 70&#x00025; of serum concentration in gingival crevicular fluid. Incubation of human serum with recombinant cysteine protease of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> (interpain A) resulted in a drastic decrease in bactericidal activity of the serum. Furthermore, a clinical strain 59 expressing interpain A was more serum-resistant than another clinical strain 57, which did not express interpain A, as determined by Western blotting. Moreover, in the presence of the cysteine protease inhibitor E64, the killing of strain 59 by human serum was enhanced. Importantly, we found that the majority of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> strains isolated from chronic and aggressive periodontitis carry and express the interpain A gene. The protective effect of interpain A against serum bactericidal activity was found to be attributable to its ability to inhibit all three complement pathways through the efficient degradation of the &#x003b1;-chain of C3&#x02014;the major complement factor common to all three pathways. <italic>P. intermedia</italic> has been known to co-aggregate with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, which produce gingipains to efficiently degrade complement factors. Here, interpain A was found to have a synergistic effect with gingipains on complement degradation. In addition, interpain A was able to activate the C1 complex in serum, causing deposition of C1q on inert and bacterial surfaces, which may be important at initial stages of infection when local inflammatory reaction may be beneficial for a pathogen. Taken together, the newly characterized interpain A proteinase appears to be an important virulence factor of <italic>P. intermedia</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p><italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic> is one of the bacterial pathogens that has been implicated in causing periodontitis&#x02014;an endemic inflammatory disease of the supporting structures of the teeth. The complement system is an important part of host innate immunity and is able to directly kill invading bacteria. To become successful pathogens, many strains of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> developed mechanisms making them very resistant to killing by complement. We found that a cysteine protease, interpain A, that is produced by many clinical strains of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> was able to destroy the bacterial killing activity of human serum. A strain of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> that produces interpain A was found to be more resistant to complement than the one lacking interpain A, and the resistance of the interpain A&#x02013;producing strain could be diminished by a specific inhibitor of cysteine proteases. We attributed the protective effect of interpain A to its ability to inhibit the complement system through the efficient degradation of C3&#x02014;a major complement protein that is common to all three pathways of complement activation. Understanding the mechanism governing pathogen resistance to complement may help us to design novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat an important bacterial disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Periodontitis is an inflammatory condition with an infective etiology that leads to loss of tooth support. <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic> is a major bacterial periodontal pathogen in humans together with <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Darby1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>P. intermedia</italic> is often recovered from subgingival plaque in patients suffering from acute necrotising gingivitis, pregnancy gingivitis and chronic periodontitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Loesche1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, <italic>P. intermedia</italic> was reported to be found in 14&#x00025; of adult population in Finland and there was association between the carriage of this species and the number of teeth with deepened periodontal pockets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Kononen1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>P. intermedia</italic> was also frequently isolated from root canal infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Tomazinho1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Periodontitis is one of the most common diseases affecting humans and is primarily the result of colonization of the subgingival surfaces of teeth by bacteria. The complex interaction between these bacteria harboring many virulence factors and the host's immune response results in localized chronic inflammation and subsequent destruction of the supporting structures of the tooth. Proteinases are crucial virulence factors produced by many periodontal pathogens, which can cause the degradation of host proteins for essential nutrients but they can also protect the bacteria from the host's defenses such as the complement system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Popadiak1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Potempa1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Complement is a major arm of the innate immune defense system and its main function is to recognize and destroy microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Walport1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The three pathways of human complement ensure that virtually any non-host surface is recognized as hostile. The classical pathway is usually mediated by binding of the C1 complex (composed of recognition molecule C1q and two proteinases C1s and C1r) to invading pathogens either directly or via immunoglobulins. The lectin pathway is able to recognize, via mannose-binding lectin (MBL), polysaccharide molecules normally present only on microbial surfaces. Finally, complement can also be activated through the alternative pathway, which is not so much an activation pathway but as a failure to appropriately regulate the constant low-level spontaneous activation of C3 (constantly initiated due to inherent instability of this protein). All three pathways lead to opsonisation of the pathogen with C3b (activated form of complement factor C3), which enhances phagocytosis by phagocytes. Furthermore, anaphylatoxins C5a and C3a are released as byproducts to attract phagocytes to the site of infection. Finally, the end result of the complement cascade is formation of the membrane attack complex and bacterial cell lysis. Host cells protect themselves from bystander damage following complement activation through the expression of membrane-bound or recruitment of soluble endogenous complement inhibitors.</p><p>Complement deficiencies are very rare but it has been observed that partial C4 gene deficiencies are more frequent in patients with severe chronic periodontitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Seppanen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. A patient with aggressive periodontitis and severe edema, localized to the free gingival tissues was reported to be deficient in C1-inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Roberts1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the highest salivary levels of C3 were measured in periodontally healthy subjects while low levels were often found in edentulous and chronic periodontitis patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Aurer1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that heat inactivation of NHS (i.e. inactivation of complement) significantly reduced opsonic activity for <italic>P. intermedia in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Tofte1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that complement is important for host defense against this pathogen. Previous studies have shown that <italic>P. intermedia</italic> was opsonized by the alternative pathway in the absence of the classical pathway, probably in response to the endotoxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Okuda1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, however, kinetic studies revealed that opsonisation proceeded at significantly faster rates when the classical pathway was intact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Tofte1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the alternative pathway contributed to the killing of serum sensitive strains while the classical pathway was primarily responsible for killing of strains with intermediate sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Sundqvist1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it appears that complement is able to recognize <italic>P. intermedia</italic> via several sensory molecules. However, it appears that <italic>P. intermedia</italic> is able to override to some extent the complement defenses and to establish chronic infections in the oral cavity.</p><p>Every successful human pathogen must develop means to circumvent complement. Many bacteria are able to capture human complement inhibitors such as C4b-binding protein and factor H thereby inhibiting complement and avoiding opsonisation and lysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Blom1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Potempa2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Based on similarity of primary and tertiary structures to known proteinases, InpA is now classified into clan CA, family C10 and registered in the peptidase database MEROPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Rawlings1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://merops.sanger.ac.uk">http://merops.sanger.ac.uk</ext-link>). InpA is a secreted protein composed of 868 amino acid residues including a 44-residue signal peptide, a pro-domain (Ala1-Asn111), a catalytic domain (Val112-Pro359) and a 465-residue C-terminal extension arranged in domains with putative regulatory and secretory functions. However, the specific target(s) and function of InpA have yet to be characterized. In the present study, we have examined in detail the effect of InpA on the human complement system and found that this proteinase targets mainly the C3 component, thereby inhibiting all three complement pathways simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>inpA</italic> gene is present in the majority of the clinical isolates of <italic>P. intermedia</italic></title><p>In order to estimate what fraction of <italic>P. intermedia</italic> strains found in periodontitis carry the <italic>inpA</italic> gene, detection by PCR was used on subgingival plaque samples obtained from 24 and 58 patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis, respectively.

It should be noted, however, that 10&#x00025; serum was used for the alternative pathway hemolytic assay versus 1.25&#x00025; for the classical pathway. These concentrations were chosen on a basis of the initial titration and represent conditions in which each assay was most sensitive. The alternative pathway is known to require high concentrations of serum in order to function properly in contrast to the classical pathway that is rapidly activated even at fractions of percent of NHS.

Now we can add C3 to this list.</p><p>Importantly, inhibition of C3 function occurred even when InpA was incubated with whole NHS showing that C3 will be specifically degraded even in the presence of all other plasma proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g003">Figures 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g004"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g005">5</xref>). This is not the case for C4, which was degraded efficiently when purified proteins were used but its function was only weakly affected in the presence of whole serum. According to kinetic parameters determined with purified proteins, C4 should be a far better target for InpA than C3 in serum. Despite that C4 in serum seems to be resistant to proteolytic inactivation by InpA. To explain this discrepancy, we speculate that C4 may interact with other protein(s) in serum, which hinders InpA access to a cleavage site. Alternatively, the &#x003b1;-chain of C4 may also be susceptible to proteolysis in serum but the cleaved protein is still a functional source of C4b. The latter explanation is supported by the observation that in contrast to C3, proteolysis of C4 is more limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000316-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Such phenomenon has previously been observed for &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin, which remained functionally active after cleavage with gingipains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Gron1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, it is clear that InpA will affect C3 in a way that it can no longer propagate the complement cascades; which should be of direct benefit to InpA producing <italic>P. intermedia</italic>.</p><p>Interestingly, InpA showed a preference for the &#x003b1;-chain of C3 and C4, similar to what we have previously observed for gingipains. At low concentrations, gingipains were able to activate complement factors C3, C4 and C5 as they preferentially target the &#x003b1;-chains of these proteins to cause the release of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a as well as the activated forms C3b, C4b and C5b. Similarly, N-terminal sequencing of C3 and C4 fragments generated by InpA revealed that InpA will also release C3a and C4a. At higher concentrations, gingipains simply degrade these three complement factors, particularly C3, into smaller fragments so that they can no longer propagate the complement cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Wingrove1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Schenkein4">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Yet again, we observe a similar phenomenon for InpA in case of C3. Also similar to gingipains, InpA was able to cause the deposition of C1 from serum onto inert surfaces without the need for a specific C1 activator; which may lead to local inflammation. However, whereas this effect could be recreated <italic>in vitro</italic> using purified C1 for gingipains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Popadiak1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, InpA required serum to be present for this to occur (data not shown). Thus, it appears that InpA may require a third protein to induce C1 deposition from serum. Consequently, an intricate strategy emerges: periodontal bacteria at low concentrations appear to cause non-specific activation of C1 and to generate C5a and C3a fragments&#x02014;chemotactic factors for neutrophils. This may lead to a low grade inflammation that provides access to nutrients for bacterial growth and colonization. At higher concentrations of bacteria and proteinases, the complement system becomes incapacitated by multiple cleavages of critical proteins within the cascade.</p><p><italic>P. intermedia</italic> can be highly resistant to complement and survive at very high serum concentrations but there are significant differences between various strains with regard to sensitivity to killing by complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000316-Sundqvist1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our current methodology does not allow for truly quantitative analysis of the InpA content in gingival crevicular fluid. However, we can estimate from our Western blotting analysis that 20 &#x000b5;L of crevicular fluid contained at least 0.1 &#x000b5;g of InpA.

Initial velocity of the reaction at each concentration was calculated as amount of substrate consumed within one second and fitted by nonlinear regression into the Michaelis-Menten equation V&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;(k<sub>cat</sub>&#x0002a;&#x0005b;E&#x0005d;<sub>t</sub>&#x0002a;&#x0005b;S&#x0005d;)/(&#x0005b;S&#x0005d;&#x0002b;K<sub>m</sub>) using GraphPad Prism.
