Consequently, EZH2 knockdown led to a decreased number of breast cancer cells undergoing mitosis. In support of these data, ectopic expression of EZH2 in the non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells caused a striking increase in the mitotic fraction.

Our xenograft mouse models thus suggest that EZH2 inhibiting compounds may have potential utility in treating ER negative breast cancer patients, and provide the foundation for the design of pre-clinical models.</p><p id="P23">In addition to its role in hereditary breast cancer, BRCA1 expression is reduced in up to 40 % of sporadic breast carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Turner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Turner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Wilson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Yoshikawa et al., 2000</xref>). Although BRCA1 promoter methylation is responsible for BRCA1 reduction in 10&#x02013;15 % of sporadic breast carcinomas, it does not explain BRCA1 deficiency in the remainder of the tumors and it has been suggested that a group of ER basal-like breast carcinomas are characterized by BRCA1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Turner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Turner et al., 2007</xref>). Discovery of novel strategies to restore BRCA1 expression and function is highly desirable to develop therapies for women carrying BRCA1-deficient tumors.</p><p id="P24">It has been proposed that the function BRCA1 in cell cycle regulation complements its role in DNA damage response, by allowing time for DNA repair to occur more effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mullan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Venkitaraman, 2002</xref>). We demonstrate that EZH2 knockdown in ER negative breast cancer cell lines causes up-regulation of BRCA1 protein levels with a concomitant increase in pBRCA1 s1423; the total amount of the latter being crucial for G2/M arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Cortez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Xu et al., 2001</xref>). Consistently, ectopic overexpression of EZH2 in benign breast cells decreased nuclear BRCA1 and pBRCA1 s1423 protein levels. The <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of these findings is underscored by our xenograft mouse models showing that EZH2 knockdown increased BRCA1 and pBRCA1 s1423 proteins in the nuclei of breast cancer cells <italic>in situ</italic>. Of note, our data demonstrate that the observed effects of EZH2 down-regulation on breast cancer cell proliferation and G2/M transition require BRCA1, as BRCA1 inhibition was sufficient to completely rescue the decrease in cell proliferation and the delay in G2 caused by EZH2 down-regulation.</p><p id="P25">Ectopic overexpression of BRCA1 in breast cancer cells has been shown to cause G2/M arrest by regulating the levels and activity of Cdc2/Cyclin B1 complex and the dual phosphatase Cdc25C, both of which are essential for G2/M checkpoint control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">MacLachlan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Yan et al., 2005</xref>). At the G2/M transition, hyperphosphorylation of Cdc25C on several sites within its regulatory N-terminal domain coincides with mitotic activation of Cdc25C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bonnet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bulavin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Roshak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Strausfeld et al., 1994</xref>). Once activated, Cdc25C is able to dephosphorylate Ccd2-Tyr15, which increases the activity of the Cdc2/Cyclin B1 complex and results in entry into mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Dunphy, 1994</xref>). Providing strong evidence in support of EZH2 participation in BRCA1-mediated G2/M checkpoint control, EZH2 knockdown decreased nuclear mitotic Cdc25C, increased Cdc2 and Cdc2-Tyr15 phosphorylation, and decreased total and phosphorylated Cyclin B1. Importantly, BRCA1 knockdown reverted the effects of EZH2 down-regulation on the levels of both mitotic Cdc25C, and total and phosphorylated Cyclin B1.</p><p id="P26">Our experiments show that EZH2 knockdown is sufficient to increase BRCA1 levels in breast cancer cells and trigger similar effects in G2/M as those reported after ectopic expression of BRCA1 using an adenovirus vector in the absence of ionizing irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">MacLachlan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Yan et al., 2005</xref>). We propose that EZH2 knockdown in breast cancer cells reduces their growth by enhancing the cell cycle regulatory effects of BRCA1, slowing the transition from G2 to M phases, and allowing more time for DNA repair to occur. This hypothesis is supported by our experiments showing that breast cancer cells with EZH2 knockdown have increased levels of pBRCA1 s1423 protein, which is crucial for G2/M arrest and is activated during the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Xu et al., 2001</xref>). Even though the precise mechanism by which EZH2 modulates BRCA1 protein levels will require further studies, unpublished preliminary data from our laboratory suggest that it does not involve BRCA1 gene transcription since EZH2 knockdown had no effect on BRCA1 messenger RNA. This finding is not surprising in light of studies showing that EZH2 regulates the activity of Cdc42 without directly affecting its transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Su et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, we have no evidence by co-immunoprecipitation of a direct interaction between EZH2 and BRCA1 proteins (data not shown). A functional connection of EZH2 and BRCA1 proteins is currently under investigation.</p><p id="P27">The relevance of the association between EZH2 and BRCA1 proteins to human breast cancer is highlighted by the finding that 76 % of ER negative invasive carcinomas overexpress EZH2 and are negative for pBRCA1 s1423 protein. Previous studies have demonstrated that ER negative breast carcinomas have significantly lower BRCA1 protein than ER positive tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Turner et al., 2007</xref>). However, the expression of pBRCA1 s1423 has not been reported. Our study shows for the first time that pBRCA1 s1423 levels are significantly associated with the ER status of invasive breast carcinomas as invasive carcinomas with negative ER exhibit significantly higher levels of pBRCA1 s1423 protein.</p><p id="P28">In conclusion, our results demonstrate a previously undescribed function of EZH2 during ER negative breast cancer progression by showing that EZH2 knockdown decreases tumor proliferation and growth <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and influences the transition from G2 phase to mitosis. We provide the first link between EZH2 and BRCA1 proteins and show that EZH2 knockdown depends on BRCA1 up-regulation to decrease breast cancer proliferation and progression through G2 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Our data raise a novel hypothesis that restoration of BRCA1 function by EZH2 knockdown may effectively decrease tumor progression enabled by BRCA1 deficiency, and provide a new lead toward future developments of specific strategies to restore BRCA1 levels and function, and for possible prevention of ER negative tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P29">SUM149 cell line was developed and provided by S.P.

In immunoblots, the numbers underneath each band indicate the fold change in intensity of the corresponding band relative to the control. <bold>C.</bold> Left, EZH2 knockdown decreases the number of cells undergoing mitosis as determined by flow cytometry using phosphorylated histone 3 antibody. Right, EZH2 overexpression in MCF10A cells increases the number of cells in mitosis.

Based on our data, we propose that EZH2 regulates the levels of BRCA1 protein and its serine 1423 phosphorylation in the breast epithelium. Low levels of EZH2, as occurs in normal breast epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Ding et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kleer et al., 2003</xref>), regulate BRCA1 and control cell proliferation in the normal breast epithelium by regulating the levels of Cdc25C and the Cdc2-CyclinB1 complex. EZH2 overexpression results in decreased BRCA1 and pBRCA1 s1423 with 30 high levels of Cdc2-CyclinB1 complex and uncontrolled proliferation and mitosis, which contributes to breast carcinogenesis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms76277f7"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p id="P48">Association between EZH2 and pBRCA1 s1423 proteins in invasive carcinomas of the breast according to the ER status</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameter</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EZH2 high pBRCA1 s1423&#x02212;</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EZH2 high pBRCA1 s1423+</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EZH2 low pBRCA1 s1423&#x02212;</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EZH2 Low pBRCA1 s1423+</th><th align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TFN1">*</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N %</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N %</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N %</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N %</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ER negative</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29 (76.3)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (75)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (23.7)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (25)</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ER positive</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (50)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (50)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 (50)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27 (50)</td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NS</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TFN1"><label>*</label><p id="P49">Chi square test</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></back></article>
