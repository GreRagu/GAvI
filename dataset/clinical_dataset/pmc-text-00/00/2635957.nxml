This type of identification mediates many kinds of social interactions and may reflect adaptations to a long history of group living in humans. Recent admixture in the US between groups from different continents, and the historically strong emphasis on phenotypic differences between members of these groups, presents an opportunity to examine the degree of concordance between estimates of group membership based on genetic markers and on visually-based estimates of facial features. We first measured the degree of Native American, European, African and East Asian genetic admixture in a sample of 14 self-identified Hispanic individuals, chosen to cover a broad range of Native American and European genetic admixture proportions. We showed frontal and side-view photographs of the 14 individuals to 241 subjects living in New Mexico, and asked them to estimate the degree of NA admixture for each individual. We assess the overall concordance for each observer based on an aggregated measure of the difference between the observer and the genetic estimates. We find that observers reach a significantly higher degree of concordance than expected by chance, and that the degree of concordance as well as the direction of the discrepancy in estimates differs based on the ethnicity of the observer, but not on the observers' age or sex. This study highlights the potentially high degree of discordance between physical appearance and genetic measures of ethnicity, as well as how perceptions of ethnic affiliation are context-specific. We compare our findings to those of previous studies and discuss their implications.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The feeding ecology of humans demands complex social behavior and extensive cooperation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Kaplan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, resulting in multilevel selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Bowles1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Traulsen1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> for strong within-group cohesion and out-group circumspection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Olsson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Golby1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

Kurzban et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Kurzban1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> have argued that in today's society, the tendency to categorize individuals by race is not inevitable, and only exists in as much as it encodes information about social alliances, thus highlighting how race is socially perceived in a highly context-specific way. On the other hand, Gil-White <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-GilWhite1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> argues that our cognitive architecture has evolved in such a way as to &#x0201c;essentialize&#x0201d; ethnic groups as if they were different species, and is initially determined by assessment of morphological characters, then reinforced or overridden by knowledge of common descent. However, he finds that among Mongols and Kazakhs, facial characters were of limited reliability in assigning a pictured individual to an ethnic group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-GilWhite2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Ethnographic evidence shows that relatedness and kinship are important features of human sociality, and that over human evolutionary history, cognitive and cultural mechanisms may have been selected to associate group membership based on these criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-GilWhite1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Across societies, kinship terms are culturally co-opted and extended to a wider set of non-kin within the family, tribe, or ethnic group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Jones1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Johnson1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. This way of thinking about kinship was likely adaptive at the group and individual levels in ensuring reciprocity and solidarity within groups by extending emotions associated with the closest of kin to all members of the group. The evolutionary mechanisms associated with distinguishing one's groups vs. other are likely in operation when humans are faced with the novel environment of today's societies that are often characterized by the presence of other individuals who are phenotypically different. Jones (2000) has suggested that today we see the world as being divided into large, geographically defined kin groups defined by &#x0201c;underlying natural commonalities.&#x0201d; Indeed, even in today's large nation-states, we find leaders playing to their public's emotions by evoking a feeling of kinship among citizens (Johnson et al. 1987; Salmon 1998).</p><p>There has been extensive research on facial recognition and how it differs according to the race of the observer and the race of the observed. Studies consistently show an own-race effect in which individuals are better at recognizing faces from their own racial group than faces from other racial groups, and the magnitude of this effect is generally attributed to the level of experience and exposure that individuals have to faces of different races <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Malpass1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Meissner1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. There have been several studies that examine the discrepancy between self-identified race and observed race. Harris and Sim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Harris1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> examined the relationship between self-reported race and race as perceived by one observer. They find a high degree of concordance, except for faces of American Indian and multiracial individuals. Harris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Harris2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> examined the variation in how individuals identify a person's race, and finds that self-reported race is more likely to be confirmed for individuals who belong to a single racial group, especially Whites and Blacks. Match rates for multiracial and Latino faces are the lowest. Harris also finds that observers who had more experience with people of other races were better at categorizing the ethnicity of individuals. Habyarimana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Habyarimana1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> find that among a sample of US university students, observers are unable to correctly identify the ethnicity of photographed individuals more than 30 percent of the time, that observers more often correctly categorize co-ethnics, and that Latinos are less successfully categorized than White, Asians, or African Americans.</p><p>According to Condit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Condit1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, it is likely that there is a common social perception that racial groupings correspond to differences in physical appearance, that physical appearance is caused by genetics, and &#x0201c;therefore that race has a genetic basis&#x0201d;. Parra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Parra1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> were the first to examine the relationship between genetic admixture and estimation of &#x0201c;Color&#x0201d; from facial appearance and skin color. This estimate of &#x0201c;Color&#x0201d; was based on the evaluations of a sample of Brazilians by two health care workers who examined skin pigmentation on the arm, hair color and texture, and the shape of the nose and lips. The relationship between the resulting estimated &#x0201c;Color&#x0201d; variable and African genetic admixture, based on 10 Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs), was examined. They find a high degree of overlap in the levels of African genetic admixture between the Brazilians who were classified as Black, Intermediate, and White, but a much smaller degree of overlap between Brazilians and the putative parental un-admixed populations from Portugal and the island of Sao Tome, off the coast of West Africa. They conclude that &#x0201c;Color&#x0201d; is a relatively poor predictor of degree of African genetic admixture. More recently, using a panel of 40 AIMs, Suarez-Kurtz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-SuarezKurtz1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> examined the relationship between self-identified &#x0201c;color&#x0201d; categories and proportion of African genetic admixture. Although they find significant overlap in African admixture between the three categories (Whites, Intermediates, Blacks), the three groups differed significantly from each other.</p><p>Hispanics are a biologically and culturally heterogeneous group produced by 400 years of mixture between Native Americans and people of European and African ancestry.

To further examine variation in error score, we use multiple linear regression to examine the relationship between rater error score and the rater's age, self-estimated Native American and European ancestry proportions, education level, and income. To determine whether there are differences in error score according to where subjects lived for most of their life, we coded subjects according to whether they lived most of their life in the southwestern United States or not.

The error in estimation by the observers (6.07) is much closer to random estimation (7.49) than it is to perfect estimation (0.36), suggesting either that facial features are not perfectly reliable indicators of ancestry as was shown in Brazil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Parra1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-SuarezKurtz1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, or that individuals are not very closely attuned to the phenotypic cues of group differences. We discuss our findings, relate them to previous findings, and discuss their implications regarding human social behavior.</p><p>We find it difficult to establish that the degree of concordance varies with age. Younger individuals show a higher degree of concordance (lower error) for the entire sample. This relationship is significant only in the student sample and not in the MVD sample. Since the students perform better than the subjects at the MVD, the effect of age may actually be an effect of being a college student (education, SES, etc&#x02026;). Alternatively, this age effect may be due to the age of the photographed individuals who are between the ages of 18 and 33. Perhaps, mating and social considerations influence the amount of attention paid to cues of group affiliation, and the payoffs to the detection of these cues is highest at the ages when mating effort is highest, and in this case, when both the observer and the persons in the photograph are of the same age.</p><p>We also find that the degree of concordance varies according to self-identified ethnicity and self-assessed ancestry proportions of the observers. Most notably, those who self-identify as White, and those who report having a higher degree of European admixture have a higher degree of concordance between their estimates and the genetic estimates (i.e. lower error score) than observers who identify as Native American and report having lower levels of European ancestry. Since most of the photographed individuals were closer to having 0&#x00025; Native American ancestry than 100&#x00025;, these results are consistent with the results of Habyarimana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Habyarimana1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> who find that the rate of correct ethnic identification of in-group members is higher than for out-group individuals. They may also be consistent with the contact/differential experience hypothesis for facial recognition which proposes that facial recognition success is higher for in-group members than for out-group members because of having more contact/experience with members of one's in-group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Brigham1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. It could be that Native Americans in this sample have less contact/ experience with individuals who have low levels of Native American ancestry than Whites do. It may therefore be less socially important for them to observe variation in other-race individuals as much as it would be in own-race individuals. Although this hypothesis applies to facial recognition of own-race versus other-race individuals, it can nonetheless shed some light on these findings.</p><p>These findings have several implications. In the medical field, race may sometimes play an important role in how disease risk is assessed, and accurate records of ethnicity are important to accurately understand population differences with respect to health-related phenotypes. According to several reports, the agreement between self-reported ethnicity and administration records that are based on visual inspection by medical staff is tenuous, especially for Hispanics and Native Americans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Gomez1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Hahn1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. The results presented here confirm this tenuous relationship. For these reasons, it has been argued that self-reported ethnicity is preferable to medical record data. However, self-reported data may provide an incomplete picture of ethnicity, especially in admixed populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Burchard1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Choudhry1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, in one study of Puerto Rican women living in New York City, subjects have anywhere between 0 and 90&#x00025; Native American ancestry and 0 to 60&#x00025; African ancestry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Bonilla1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, and among several samples of African Americans, subjects show anywhere between 0 and 80&#x00025; European ancestry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Sinha1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Parra3">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>These results also have implications when considering the history of admixture, sexual selection, and the genetics of complex traits. For example, it may be that after several generations of sexual selection for facial appearance, the genetic variants that are responsible for those traits would no longer be in linkage disequilibrium with other population-specific genetic variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Parra1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. This process would result in dissociation between these traits and the estimate of genetic admixture for the rest of the genome. Depending on their specific history, populations differ in how they are stratified with respect to admixture. This will affect the strength of the correlation between genetic admixture estimated from genetic markers scattered throughout the genome and any phenotypes that differ between parental populations. Factors such as a long time since initial admixture, non-continuous gene flow, and assortative mating will decrease the degree of admixture stratification, and hence the relationship between overall admixture and phenotypes that are different between parental populations and that are controlled by just a few loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004460-Parra4">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The results from this paper demonstrate that there is a relationship between social and biological measures of race/ethnicity but that it is far from perfect and is context specific. It should be noted that we are testing for this relationship at a very high resolution (within an ethnic group), suggesting that at broader levels of race/ethnicity groupings, the relationship would likely be closer. The results also suggest that the degree to which humans are attuned to cues of group membership extends to cues of kinship as assessed by physical appearance, in addition to other cues such as language and cultural markers.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings warrant further research in other admixed populations such as African Americans, as well as more studies that can isolate specific facial phenotypes and how they vary with admixture.
