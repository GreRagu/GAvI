According to the censusestimates in 2001, its population was 1,283,225.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Around 40%of the population was more than 35 years of age. There werefive health facilities in the district with a maximum of 25 kmdistance from any of the 52 villages/towns. Sixty-two per centof the population could be considered as economically poor asthey were classified below the poverty line. Among the adultpopulation, 42% were farmers, 13% were farm laborers and16% were homemakers.</p><p>A prevalence study of blindness, low vision and glaucomawas conducted in 2001 in this district by the researchers ofWardha University. The authors present a part of this projectcovering the prevalence, distribution and determinants ofglaucoma in the &#x02265;35-year-old population of the Rajnandangaondistrict of central India.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The state government and research committee of the MahatmaGandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Sevagram, Wardhaapproved this study. Health and local administrators gavewritten consent for conducting the study. In view of the highilliteracy rate and logistic problem in taking thumb impressionsof participants, the field investigators received verbal consentof the participants. It was a community-based cross-sectionalprevalence study.</p><p>The estimates aimed to determine the prevalence ofglaucoma in the target population at district level. We assumedthat glaucoma in the &#x02265;35-year-old population would be around3%. To achieve 95% confidence interval with an acceptable errorof margin of 15%, the required sample for our study was 5,748.To compensate dropouts, we increased the sample by 20%. Thusthe final minimum sample planned was 6,898.</p><p>The demographic data of the 1991 census was used for thesampling frame.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> The names of villages and their populationswere listed. Each cluster comprised population between 850 and1,700. Villages having &#x0003c;750 people were grouped together. Fortowns with a population of more than 1,700 we subdivided thearea of the town into more clusters. The geographic boundariesof these clusters based on the local layout were defined. Twenty-five clusters were selected from the list by using simple randomtable. Each house in the cluster was given a unique number. Allresidents &#x02265;35 years of age and staying in these houses for morethan six months were enrolled in the survey.</p><p>We excluded the residents if they did not agree to participateor were mentally challenged or did not report to the examinationcenter in the village even after requesting thrice.</p><p>A team of enumerators visited each house. Twoophthalmologists (one third-year postgraduate ophthalmicresident and one ophthalmologist with diploma inophthalmology) with two years of experience in diagnosticand eye care procedures at the ophthalmology department wereincluded as our field staff for ophthalmic evaluation. Personalinterview was conducted to determine profile, exposure to therisk factors of glaucoma like family history of glaucoma, oculartrauma, past eye surgery, treatment for glaucoma. Historywas taken and general checkup was done to rule out diabetes,anemia and hypertension.</p><p>The visual acuity of each eye; both with and withoutcorrections was noted using ETDRS chart. Dynamic refractionwas carried out manually using direct retinoscope followed bysubjective corrections. Anterior segment was examined bothby torch light and slit-lamp (M/S Appasamy) to note status ofcornea, anterior chamber, lens and pupillary reaction. Ocularpressure was measured with the help of Perkins applanationtonometer. Tonometry was repeated if pressure was noted tobe &#x0003c;10 mm Hg or &#x0003e;25 mm Hg. Pupil was dilated and directophthalmoscopy (Keelers) was carried out to evaluate theposterior segment of eye. Based on the predefined criteria likeocular pressure more than 22 mm Hg, cup: disc ratio more than0.6, presence of hemorrhage on or near disc, nerve fiber defect,nicking of vessels at the rim of the optic cup and presence ofoverpass phenomenon, persons were suspected to suffer fromglaucoma in either eye [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Two hundred and eighty-twosuch patients were reexamined in detail to elicit risk factorsand symptoms related to glaucoma. We used four mirror (Zies)gonio-lens and slit-lamp to perform gonioscopy. We assessedthe depth of the anterior chamber by van Herick method. Ifany of the assessment could not be carried out, its reason wasnoted. The pupils were dilated subsequently and the disc andsurrounding retina were evaluated by fundus contact lensand slit-lamp so that stereoscopic view could be obtained. Fordilating the pupil, we instilled one drop of 10% phenylephrinein each eye and repeated this procedure after 15 min if pupilswere not dilated adequately. For persons with defective vision,we also evaluated refractive status and for cycloplagia, weinstilled an additional drop of 0.5% hom-atropine. The discand surrounding retina&#x02032;s sketch was drawn on a paper withgrid of 0.1 mm vertical and horizontal dotted lines. A drawingof optic disc was also made with 0.5 mm diameter of the opticcup. We assessed nerve fiber layer defect with the help of directophthalmoscopy and red-free filter.</p><p>Four hundred and forty-two eyes of 246 persons had discchanges suggestive of glaucoma, ocular pressure of more than22 mm Hg, pressure difference of more than 6 mm Hg in botheyes or presence of risk factor suggestive of glaucoma. Theywere tested for their field of vision. Central field was assessedon the Bjerrum&#x02032;s screen using 1 mm white target. Peripheral fieldwas tested by Lister&#x02032;s semi-automated arc perimeter. Temporalisland of 10 and 20 degrees around fixation point, central andparacentral scotoma, arcuate scotoma, Ronne&#x02032;s nasal step type offield defects and constriction of peripheral field were consideredas glaucomatous field changes.</p><p>A person having glaucomatous field defect, glaucomatousdisc changes or ocular pressure of &#x02265;22 mm Hg in the presence ofan open angle in either eye, was defined to suffer from PrimaryOpen Angle Glaucoma (PAOG). A person having glaucomatousfield defects with glaucomatous disc changes or ocular pressureof &#x02265;22 mm Hg, in the presence of occludable angle in either eyewas considered as a case of Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma(PACG). If the field assessment was not possible, symptomssuggestive of glaucoma (pain, redness, inability to see carwhile driving, past attack of severe eye pain with nausea andvomiting) along with ocular pressure and angle closure foundby gonioscopy were the criteria to define PACG. Persons withoptic disc changes suggestive of glaucoma but without fielddefects were labeled as glaucoma suspects. If ocular pressurewas &#x02265;22 mm Hg and angle was open but no field changes ordisc changes were suggestive of glaucoma, the person wasconsidered to have ocular hypertension. If a person was havingincreased intraocular pressure, retinal/disc changes of glaucomaas mentioned in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and evident ocular co-morbidity likehyper-mature cataract, chronic iridocyclitis, intraocular tumoror hemorrhage in vitreous, he/she was considered to suffer fromsecondary glaucoma.</p><p>To ensure high quality of the survey, we conducted a pilotstudy in a village of Wardha district that was not included inthe survey. Ocular pressure measurement and sketches of opticcup and disc were used to test inter-observer variation. The fieldstaff&#x02032;s observations were compared to the findings of a seniorophthalmologist who was an expert in glaucoma care. Twohundred eyes of 103 persons were tested. The agreement ratefor ocular pressure measurement was found in 96% while cupdisc ratio and presence of other evidence of glaucoma in fundusmatched in 90% of eyes examined. A standardization workshopwas also carried out prior to the field part of the survey.</p><p>The participants with eye problems were given medicationsand medical advice free of cost. The identity of the participantwas de-linked from other information to maintain confidentiality.The outcome of the survey and recommendations to improvethe glaucoma care were discussed with the district and statehealth authorities.</p><p>Pre-tested data collection forms were used in the field andafter auditing them, the forms were computed using EPI6software. We used Statistical Package for Social studies (SPSS-9) software for analysis. The outcome variable was glaucomaper person. (Glaucoma could be in both the eyes of a personbut only one person was considered to be suffering fromglaucoma.) The dependent variables were gender, age groupand type of glaucoma. Since the distribution of our large samplewas uniform, we carried out parametric type of univariateanalysis and calculated frequencies, percentage proportions,95% confidence intervals and Odd&#x02032;s ratios.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 8,397 enumerated persons, 7,438 (87.3%) were examined,7,231 of them were examined at the examination center while207 were examined at home.

The age-sex standardizedprevalence of glaucoma was 3.67% (95% CI 3.27 to 4.07) inthe &#x02265; 35 years old population of Rajnandangaon district ofChhattisgarh state of India. Gender variation of glaucoma wasnot significant [OR = 1.13 (CI 95% 0.88 to 1.44)]. Glaucoma variedsignificantly by age groups. (&#x003a7;<sup>2</sup> = 48.2, degree of freedom = 3 p&#x0003c;0.001) The prevalence of glaucoma of our study is comparedto that of other studies in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>.</p><p>Of the 283 persons with glaucoma, 37 (13.1%) had POAG,60 (21.2%) had PACG, secondary glaucoma and ocularhypertension were found in 60 (21.2%) and 41 (14.5%) personsrespectively. As many as 85 (30%) of the examined persons were&#x02032;glaucoma suspects.&#x02032;</p><p>The best corrected visual status in the better eye was usedto categorize the persons into different visual disabilitieswhich were grouped as absolute blind (no perception of light),blindness (Vision &#x0003c;10/200), legal Blind (Vision&#x0003c;20/200) and Lowvision (vision &#x0003c;20/60) disabled and normal (vision &#x02265; 20/60)[<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. The risk of visual impairment with blindness andlow vision was significantly more among those suffering fromglaucoma than those who were not having glaucoma.</p><p>Five cases (1.8%) of glaucoma had family history ofglaucoma. Thirty-one persons (11%) had undergone eye surgeryin the past. Sixteen persons (5.7%) had aphakic glaucoma while28 persons (9.9%) had glaucoma with un-operated cataract asits possible cause.

In this context, assessment of the magnitude and riskfactors of glaucoma in the relatively poorer community of Indiawas useful to the health planners of the newly formed state.The demographic structure of the study area is having a largeproportion of children and &#x0003c;15% proportion of the elderlypopulation. This matches with the demographic trends of otherdeveloping countries.</p><p>Uniform definition of glaucoma for the survey andto compare the magnitude is a matter of debate. Newertechnological tools like &#x02032;Frequency Doubling Perimetry&#x02032;,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>optical coherent tomography,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> blood flow measurement atoptic discs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> are availablein specialized ophthalmic clinics for diagnosis as well as formonitoring the progress of glaucoma. Unfortunately, many ofthese tools are not easily available to clinicians in developingcountries. For the community-based surveys, they are not easyto use. Hence simple methods were used to detect changes inthe fundus and the field of vision in this study. Manual noting ofdisc changes through undilated/dilated pupil, assessing centralfield changes and measuring intraocular pressure by reliabletools have been recommended in other studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> Definitionsand classification for the community-based glaucoma surveywere proposed by Foster <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> in 2002. However, our study wascarried out prior to this publication. In addition internationalhealth authorities had not endorsed this methodology for theglaucoma survey.</p><p>Comparison of our study outcomes to results of otherstudies was a challenge. The age groups, the definitions usedand type of glaucoma covered in different studies had widevariations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref> This shows that standardization of data collectionon glaucoma is urgently needed. The Andhra Pradesh eyedisease study (APEDS) closely matched our study and theglaucoma rates were also similar.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> However, the populationin our study was primarily a rural one while in APEDS, thepersons were from Hyderabad city. Urban/rural setups andsocioeconomic conditions perhaps do not influence glaucoma.But racial differences might be the main reason for the widevariations in the prevalence of glaucoma that we found whenwe compared our results with rates of studies conducted indifferent countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></p><p>Our study was a part of assessment of blindness andlow vision in the district. In a newly developed state withcompeting demands for the resources, such an initiative ofjoining the surveys with common target population could becost-effective and the methods as well as outcomes could beused as advocacy tools in a better way. Improving eye care ofa possible 13,800 glaucoma cases should be an integral partof developing a comprehensive primary and secondary eyecare approach to combat avoidable blindness and improvetheir quality of life.</p><p>The &#x02264; 1% coverage of the existing eye care services forglaucoma care in the district is a matter of concern for thehealth planners. In addition to providing accessible facilities,it is important that rural masses are made aware of this healthproblem. As our sampling procedure was to get the prevalenceof all types of glaucoma at the national level, the gender and agegroup variations and prevalence of different types of glaucomafound in our study show trends only and should be comparedwith outcomes of other studies with caution.</p><p>The characteristics of those examined and those notparticipating in the survey were closely matching. However,the health status and awareness among the two groups arelikely to differ. This could have introduced bias in our study.If we consider that all who have not attended the survey hadno glaucoma or having the same rate as among the examinedsample, our study could have prevalence of glaucoma rangingfrom 3.37 to 3.80%. A large proportion of cases in the &#x02032;glaucomasuspect&#x02032; group indicates the limitation of a community-basedsurvey in the absence of sophisticated tools. The patientssuspected to have glaucoma should be monitored periodicallyas many of them may develop glaucoma either in that eye orin the fellow eye in future.</p><p>Personal interviews of the elderly persons to elicit historyof treatment in the past could have been affected by recallbias. Hence in our study, information of risk factors and familyhistory of glaucoma should be viewed with caution. The field ofvision was tested for a portion of the study sample. Althoughcriteria to suspect glaucoma were based on most of the knownfactors associated with glaucoma, cases with low pressureand minimal disc changes might have been missed. Hence ourstudy could have underestimated the prevalence of confirmedglaucoma. Thirteen per cent of our glaucoma cases had poorprognosis of vision. The risk of visual disabilities of differentgrades was significantly higher in glaucoma cases compared tonormal population. Thus to reduce the blindness in the studyareas, proper preventive and curative measures for glaucomamust be established. However, the strategy of mass screening todetect glaucoma in a place with prevalence of &#x0003c;5% and limitedskilled manpower and tools should be studied further beforemaking such suggestions.</p><p>It is concluded that the prevalence of glaucoma was 3.68%in Rajnandangaon district of Chhattisgarh in central India inthe age group of &#x02265; 35 years. In the same population PACG wasmore common than POAG.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Dr. Shukla guided us in this project.
