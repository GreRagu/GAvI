This study addresses the clinical profile and visualoutcome in these patients.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review of charts of cluster endophthalmitispatients was done from February 2005 to Feburary 2006 fromthe endophthalmitis registry which were referred to our center.Cluster endophthalmitis was defined as five or more casesof endophthalmitis occurring on a particular day in a singleoperating room in one center.</p><p>A total of three clusters were identified during the study(A, B and C). Two clusters comprised of nine patients eachand one cluster had six patients. Detailed clinical history,clinical features at presentation and types of surgical procedureperformed were recorded. Ultrasonography was done whenthere was no view of the fundus to assess the extent and locationof vitreous involvement and to detect retinal detachment andchoroidal detachment.</p><p>Undiluted vitreous biopsy samples were collected at thebeginning of vitreous surgery in all cases for microbiologicalevaluation. Good visual outcome was defined as visual acuityof 20/400 or better at final follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were total 24 patients in three clusters. Nine patients weremales and 15 patients were females. The age ranged from 35 to75 years (mean 60.1 years). Pain, blurred vision and hypopyonwith vitritis were the common signs and symptoms of thepatients on first presentation. Duration of symptoms rangedfrom two to nine days after cataract surgery. Fifty per centpatients presented within four days of surgery. One patienthad diabetes two 2 patients were old leprotics.</p><p>Small incision cataract surgery (SICS) was performed in13 (54%) patients and extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE)in 11 (46%) of 24 patients with intraocular lens implantation.The time of presentation varied from two to nine days aftercataract surgery (mean 3.67 &#x000b1; 1.58 days, median three days).At presentation only one patient had visual acuity more than20/400 whereas the remaining 23 patients had visual acuityworse than 20/400. Corneal infiltration was seen in six (25%)of 24 patients and hypopyon in 15 (63%) of 24 patients onpresentation. No patient had retinal detachment or choroidaldetachment at the time of presentation on standardizedechography. All patients had received preoperatively topicalciprofloxacin 0.3% and betamethasone 0.1% hourly and atropine1% three times a day. Pars plana vitrectomy with intraocularantibiotics and steroids was performed in all the patients ofthe three clusters. Intravitreal antibiotics were a combinationof vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 ml), amikacin (0.4 mg/0.1 ml) anddexamethasone (0.4 mg/0.1 ml).</p><p>The duration of follow-up ranged from six to 36 weeks (mean11 &#x000b1; 4.9 weeks). Good visual outcome was seen in five out of ninepatients in Cluster A, whereas three out of only 15 patients inCluster B and C had good visual outcome. Presence of cornealinfiltrate was seen in six patients in Cluster B, whereas it was nilin Cluster A.</p><p>Two eyes underwent repeat surgical intervention due topersistence of infection and vitreous exudation. In eight eyes thepoor visual outcome was associated with corneal scarring anddecompensation due to corneal infiltration and severe anteriorchamber exudation at the time of presentation. Among the eyeswith poor visual outcome five eyes had postoperative hypotony(one had phthisis bulbi, four had atrophic bulbi) and three eyeshad severe vitreous exudation and opacities.</p><p>The smears were positive for gram-negative bacteria in14 (58%) vitreous samples and cultures grew <italic>Pseudomonasaeruginosa</italic> in 10 (42%) of 24 samples, the remaining 10 smearsdid not show any micro-organism. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species weresensitive to amikacin in seven samples, ciprofloxacin in sevensamples and resistant to vancomycin in all samples. Therewas significant association (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) between presentingvision of &#x0003c;20/400 and growth in vitreous culture (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006)with poor visual outcome. The association between typeof surgery (<italic>P</italic> = 0.6), duration of symptoms (<italic>P</italic> = 0.64) andcorneal infiltration (<italic>P</italic> = 0.06) with visual outcome was notsignificant.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The most dreaded complication of any intraocular surgeryis the development of endophthalmitis.

In an Indian setuppostoperative infections commonly occur in clusters andgram-negative infections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> and fungi are common pathogensisolated in cluster endophthalmitis patients. The microbiology issuggestive of contaminated irrigating solutions as the culprit incausing such outbreaks.</p><p>Our study was limited by a short follow-up of six weeks asmost of the patients were inhabitants of remote tribal interiorsof the state. Defects in sterilization, contaminated irrigatingsolutions, viscoelastics, improper ventilation system, pooroperation room hygiene and hospital construction activityare various factors responsible for cluster postoperativeendophthalmitis. Source of infection could not be evaluated inour series as the patients were referred from different distanthospitals where microbiological facilities were lacking.</p><p>In high-volume cataract surgery, epidemic of endophthalmitisis always possible; we should remain vigilant and followstandardized surgical protocols and sterilization measures evenin camp surgeries. Prompt adequate and aggressive treatmentby vitreous surgery and intraocular antibiotics may lead tofavorable results.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aaberg</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name><name><surname>Flynn</surname><given-names>HW</given-names></name><name><surname>Schiffman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Newton</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nosocomical acute-onset postoperative endophthalmitis survey: A 10-year review of incidence and outcomes</article-title><source>Ophthalmology</source><year>1998</year><volume>105</volume><fpage>1004</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9627649</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ram</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaushik</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Brar</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>Taneja</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevention of postoperative infections in ophthalmic surgery</article-title><source>Indian J Ophthalmol</source><year>2001</year><volume>49</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>2</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15887707</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zaluski</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Clayman</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name><name><surname>Karsenti</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Bourzeix</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Tournemire</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> endophthalmitis caused by contaminationof the internal fluid pathways of a phacoemulsifier</article-title><source>J Catarac Refract Surg</source><year>1999</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>540</fpage><lpage>5</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Kunimoto</surname><given-names>DY</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Jalali</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Majji</surname><given-names>AB</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagaraja Rao</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Relationship between clinical presentation and visual outcome in postoperative and posttraumatic endophthalmitis in southcentral India</article-title><source>Indian J Ophthalmol</source><year>2005</year><volume>53</volume><fpage>5</fpage><lpage>16</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15829741</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lalitha</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Rajagopalan</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Prakash</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramsasamy</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Prajna</surname><given-names>NV</given-names></name><name><surname>Srinivasan</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postcataract endophthalmitis in South India incidence and outcome</article-title><source>Ophthalmology</source><year>2005</year><volume>112</volume><fpage>1884</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16157381</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study Group</collab><article-title>Results of Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study.
