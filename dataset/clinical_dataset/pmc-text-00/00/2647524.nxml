Limited sequence analysis previously showed that HTLV-4 may be distinct from HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3, and their simian counterparts, STLV-1, STLV-2, and STLV-3, respectively. Analysis of full-length genomes can provide basic information on the evolutionary history and replication and pathogenic potential of new viruses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report here the first complete HTLV-4 sequence obtained by PCR-based genome walking using uncultured peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA from an HTLV-4-infected person. The HTLV-4(1863LE) genome is 8791-bp long and is equidistant from HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3 sharing only 62&#x02013;71% nucleotide identity. HTLV-4 has a prototypic genomic structure with all enzymatic, regulatory, and structural proteins preserved. Like STLV-2, STLV-3, and HTLV-3, HTLV-4 is missing a third 21-bp transcription element found in the long terminal repeats of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 but instead contains unique c-Myb and pre B-cell leukemic transcription factor binding sites. Like HTLV-2, the PDZ motif important for cellular signal transduction and transformation in HTLV-1 and HTLV-3 is missing in the C-terminus of the HTLV-4 Tax protein. A basic leucine zipper (b-ZIP) region located in the antisense strand of HTLV-1 and believed to play a role in viral replication and oncogenesis, was also found in the complementary strand of HTLV-4. Detailed phylogenetic analysis shows that HTLV-4 is clearly a monophyletic viral group. Dating using a relaxed molecular clock inferred that the most recent common ancestor of HTLV-4 and HTLV-2/STLV-2 occurred 49,800 to 378,000 years ago making this the oldest known PTLV lineage.

Expanded surveillance and clinical studies are needed to better define the epidemiology and public health importance of HTLV-4 infection.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Deltaretroviruses are a diverse group of human and simian T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV and STLV, respectively) that until lately were composed of only two distinct human groups called HTLV types 1 and 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Two new HTLVs, HTLV-3 and HTLV-4, were recently identified in primate hunters in Cameroon effectively doubling the genetic diversity of deltaretroviruses in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Collectively, members of the HTLV groups and their STLV analogues are called primate T-lymphotropic viruses (PTLV) with PTLV-1, PTLV-2, and PTLV-3 being composed of HTLV-1/STLV-1, HTLV-2/STLV-2, and HTLV-3/STLV-3, respectively. The PTLV-4 group currently has only one member, HTLV-4, since a simian counterpart has yet to be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>STLV-1 has a broad geographic distribution in nonhuman primates (NHPs) in both Asia and Africa thus providing humans with historical and contemporaneous opportunities for exposure to this virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Indeed, phylogenetic analysis of simian T-lymphotropic viruses type 1 (STLV-1) and global HTLV-1 sequences suggests that different STLV-1s were introduced into humans multiple times in the past resulting in at least six phylogenetically distinct HTLV-1 subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recently, a new HTLV-1 subtype was found in Cameroon that was closest phylogenetically to STLV-1 from monkeys hunted in this region and which shared greater that 99% nucleotide identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Since similar high sequence identities are typically seen in both vertical and horizontal linked transmission cases of HTLV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the finding of this new HTLV-1 subtype in Cameroon suggests a relatively recent cross-species transmission of STLV-1 to this primate hunter and that these zoonotic infections continue to occur in persons naturally exposed to NHPs.</p><p>Although a simian T-lymphotropic virus type 2 (STLV-2) has been identified in two troops of captive bonobos (<italic>Pan paniscus</italic>), the zoonotic relationship of this divergent virus to HTLV-2 is less clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Like STLV-1, STLV-3 also has a broad and ancient geographic distribution across Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, while only three distinct HTLV-3 strains have been identified to date in Cameroon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], it is conceivable that HTLV-3 may be prevalent throughout Africa and, like HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, potentially could be spread globally through migrations of infected human populations. Expanded screening is needed to define the prevalence of HTLV-3 in human populations. Likewise, the epidemiology of HTLV-4 is not well understood since only a single human infection has been reported and a simian counterpart has yet to be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although limited sequencing of very small gene regions showed that HTLV-4 is most genetically related to STLV-2 and HTLV-2, but is a distinct lineage separate from all known PTLVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], understanding the evolutionary relationship of HTLV-4 to known PTLVs requires additional phylogenetic analyses using longer sequences or the complete viral genome.</p><p>Like HIV, both HTLV-1 and -2 have spread globally and are pathogenic human viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. HTLV-1 causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraperesis (HAM/TSP), and other inflammatory diseases in less than 5% of those infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. HTLV-2 is less pathogenic than HTLV-1 and has been associated with a neurologic disease similar to HAM/TSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The recent identification of HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 in only four persons limits an evaluation of the disease potential and secondary transmissibility of these novel viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, complete genomic sequences of these viruses can provide insights on the genetic structure and whether functional motifs that are important for viral expression and HTLV-induced leukemogenesis are preserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, determination of the viral sequence will be important to develop improved diagnostic assays to better understand the epidemiology of this novel human virus.</p><p>In this paper, we report the first full-length sequence of HTLV-4 and demonstrate by detailed phylogenetic analysis that this virus clearly falls outside the diversity of all other PTLVs. The observed low nucleotide substitution rate, absence of evident genetic recombination, and conserved genomic structure of HTLV-4 demonstrate the genetic stability of this virus. In addition, molecular dating suggests that the HTLV-4 lineage split from the progenitor of PTLV-2 about 200 millennia ago and is older than the ancestors of HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3. We also highlight biologically important molecular features in HTLV-4 that are unique or common to HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Comparison of the HTLV-4(1863LE) proviral genome with prototypical PTLVs</title><p>The complete genome of HTLV-4(1863LE) was obtained using a PCR strategy as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and was determined to be 8791-bp in length. Comparison of the HTLV-4(1863LE) sequence with prototypical PTLV genomes demonstrates that this newly identified human virus is nearly equidistant from HTLV-1 (62% identiity), PTLV-2 (70.7% identity), and PTLV-3 (63.4% identity) groups across the genome (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The most genetic divergence between HTLV-4 and the other PTLV groups was seen in the LTR (43&#x02013;65%) and protease (<italic>pro</italic>) gene (59&#x02013;70%), while the greatest nucleotide identity and amino acid similarity was observed within the highly conserved regulatory genes, <italic>tax </italic>and <italic>rex </italic>(73&#x02013;81% and 58&#x02013;91%, respectively). This relationship was highlighted further by comparing HTLV-4(1863LE) with prototypical full-length STLV and HTLV genomes in a similarity plot analysis, where the highest similarity was seen in the highly conserved <italic>tax </italic>gene, which is located at the 5' end of the pX region of the genome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). As seen within other PTLV groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], no clear evidence of genetic recombination of HTLV-4(1863LE) with prototypical HTLV and STLV proviral sequences was observed using bootscanning analysis in the SimPlot program (data not shown).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Percent Nucleotide Identity and Amino Acid Similarity of HTLV4(1863LE) with other PTLV Prototypes<sup>1</sup>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left">HTLV-1 (ATK)</td><td align="left">HTLV-2 (MoT)</td><td align="left">HTLV-2 (Efe)</td><td align="left">STLV-2 (PanP)</td><td align="left">STLV-2 (PP1664)</td><td align="left">HTLV-3 (2026ND)</td><td align="left">STLV-3 (TGE2117)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Genome</bold></td><td align="left">62.0</td><td align="left">70.7</td><td align="left">70.8</td><td align="left">70.4</td><td align="left">70.8</td><td align="left">63.2</td><td align="left">63.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>LTR</bold></td><td align="left">45.2</td><td align="left">63.2</td><td align="left">62.5</td><td align="left">62.5</td><td align="left">64.7</td><td align="left">42.9</td><td align="left">45.7</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>gag</italic></bold></td><td align="left">70.4 (82.0)</td><td align="left">73.2 (85.9)</td><td align="left">74.6 (85.9)</td><td align="left">74.7 (85.0)</td><td align="left">74.8 (86.3)</td><td align="left">68.3 (83.6)</td><td align="left">68.6 (82.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">p19M<sup>2</sup></td><td align="left">(68.5)</td><td align="left">(77.5)</td><td align="left">(79.1)</td><td align="left">(79.1)</td><td align="left">(79.1)</td><td align="left">(78.2)</td><td align="left">(71.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">p24C<sup>2</sup></td><td align="left">(90.2)</td><td align="left">(91.6)</td><td align="left">(91.6)</td><td align="left">(91.5)</td><td align="left">(92.6)</td><td align="left">(89.3)</td><td align="left">(90.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">p15NC<sup>2</sup></td><td align="left">(81.5)</td><td align="left">(84.0)</td><td align="left">(81.5)</td><td align="left">(81.5)</td><td align="left">(84.0)</td><td align="left">(76.5)</td><td align="left">(74.1)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>pro</italic></bold></td><td align="left">59.0 (61.9)</td><td align="left">66.7 (70.8)</td><td align="left">66.5 (59.3)</td><td align="left">70.0 (59.6)</td><td align="left">67.0 (60.0)</td><td align="left">64.1 (65.5.)</td><td align="left">64.7 (60.0)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>pol</italic></bold></td><td align="left">63.9 (68.0)</td><td align="left">71.4 (78.7)</td><td align="left">71.5 (78.6)</td><td align="left">71.1 (73.3)</td><td align="left">71.2 (78.7)</td><td align="left">64.9 (71.4)</td><td align="left">65.5 (71.2)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>env</italic></bold></td><td align="left">65.8 (75.9)</td><td align="left">73.1 (85.3)</td><td align="left">72.8 (86.0)</td><td align="left">72.0 (84.9)</td><td align="left">72.0 (85.5)</td><td align="left">68.5 (79.4)</td><td align="left">67.2 (78.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">SU<sup>3</sup></td><td align="left">(70.4)</td><td align="left">(80.1)</td><td align="left">(81.4)</td><td align="left">(80.4)</td><td align="left">(81.4)</td><td align="left">(72.9)</td><td align="left">(71.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">TM<sup>3</sup></td><td align="left">(84.7)</td><td align="left">(94.4)</td><td align="left">(93.8)</td><td align="left">(92.7)</td><td align="left">(92.7)</td><td align="left">(90.5)</td><td align="left">(91.0)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>rex</italic></bold></td><td align="left">76.0 (63.9)</td><td align="left">79.5 (74.1)</td><td align="left">81.1 (75.3)</td><td align="left">78.7 (65.2)</td><td align="left">80.7 (68.8)</td><td align="left">72.7 (59.4)</td><td align="left">72.5 (57.7)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>tax</italic></bold></td><td align="left">75.9 (82.6)</td><td align="left">80.0 (90.9)</td><td align="left">80.1 (89.5)</td><td align="left">76.7 (85.5)</td><td align="left">77.2 (90.0)</td><td align="left">74.2 (82.6)</td><td align="left">74.1 (82.6)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>1 </sup>amino acid similarity in parentheses; strain names given in parentheses</p><p><sup>2 </sup>M, matrix protein; C, capsid; NC, nucleocapsid</p><p><sup>3 </sup>SU, surface protein; TM, transmembrane</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Organization of the HTLV-4 genome (a) and schematic representation of the PCR-based genome walking strategy (b)</bold>.

Maximum clade credibility trees inferred by using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler showed three major, well supported, monophyletic PTLV groups (posterior probability p = 1.0) with HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3, each clustering in separate clades (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

The phylogenetic relationships among PTLV lineages inferred from different gene regions were also similar (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The only exception was the monophyletic PTLV-3 lineage which was either a sister lineage to PTLV-4/PTLV-2 or PTLV-5/PTLV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] in the <italic>gag </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and <italic>env </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) or <italic>pol </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and <italic>tax </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) tree topologies, respectively, but in each case with weak posterior probabilities (p &#x0003c; 0.75) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Similarly, the position of the PTLV-3 phylogroup was unresolved using both the maximum likelihood (ML) and Neighbor Joining (NJ) methods (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Fig. S2). The long branch length leading to the HTLV-4 strain suggests an ancient separation of this lineage from PTLV-2. Similarly, STLV-1(MarB43) and STLV-2 each formed distinct lineages from PTLV-1 and HTLV-2, respectively, with long branch lengths (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These findings support further the recent re-classification of STLV-1(MarB43) as a new PTLV lineage called STLV-5 and the need to re-classify STLV-2 as a distinct PTLV group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The unequivocal monophyletic relationship of HTLV-4 to other PTLVs was supported further by phylogenetic inference of similar tree topologies with robust statistical support obtained with NJ and ML analysis, using both separate alignments for each genes and the full-length genome without LTRs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Fig. S2).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic relationship of HTLV-4(1863LE) to other PTLVs in <italic>gag </italic>using Bayesian inference</bold>.

Indeed, sequence analysis showed unequal base composition for some lineages and substitution saturation at the 3<sup>rd </sup>codon position (cdp) for all PTLVs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Fig. S1). Substitution saturation was not observed in the 1<sup>st </sup>and 2<sup>nd </sup>cdps (Additional file <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Fig. S1) and these sites were thus suitable for estimating posterior evolutionary rates and divergence dates of PTLV by using Bayesian analysis with a MCMC algorithm.</p><p>The relaxed molecular clock was calibrated with two independent molecular calibration points; 12,000 &#x02013; 30,000 ya as confidence intervals for the origin of HTLV-2 as it migrated out of Africa and Asia and into the Americas via the Bering land bridge and 40,000 &#x02013; 60,000 ya as confidence intervals for the origin of HTLV-1 in Melanesia as it became populated with people from Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

Across PTLVs, Gag is one of the most conserved proteins, with the HTLV-4 Gag having 82% to 86% similarity to HTLV-1, PTLV-2, and PTLV-3 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The Gag capsid protein (214 aa) showed about 90% to 93% similarity to other PTLV capsids, while the matrix (129 aa) and nucleocapsid (81 aa) proteins were somewhat less conserved, showing less than 85% similarity to HTLV-1, PTLV-2, and PTLV-3 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

The Env surface (SU) protein (307 aa) showed the most genetic divergence from other PTLVs with only 70% &#x02013; 81% similarity, while the transmembrane (TM) protein (178 aa) was highly conserved across all PTLVs, sharing 85% &#x02013; 94% similarity, supporting the use of recombinant HTLV-1 TM protein (GD21) on WB strips to identify divergent PTLVs, including HTLV-4. The HTLV-4(1863LE) SU showed about 86% similarity to the HTLV-2 type specific SU peptide (K55) despite the observed weak reactivity of anti-HTLV-4(1863LE) antibodies to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] K55 spiked onto WB strips.

In contrast, the HTLV-4(1863LE), HTLV-2, and HTLV-3 SUs share from 68.8% to 70.8% similarity to the HTLV-1 type specific SU peptide (MTA-1). Although these results are limited to testing the sera of a single HTLV-4-infected individual, they suggest that higher antibody reactivity to the HTLV-2-type specific peptide may be observed in HTLV-4-infected persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The glucose transporter GLUT1 has been shown to be the HTLV-1 and -2 envelope receptor and a retrovirus binding domain (RBD) for GLUT1 has been identified in the SU of these viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

To characterize the HTLV-4 Tax (Tax4) we compared the sequence of Tax4 with those of prototypic HTLV-1, PTLV-2, and PTLV-3s to determine if motifs associated with specific Tax functions were preserved between each group. Alignment of the predicted Tax4 sequence shows excellent conservation of the critical functional regions, including the nuclear localization signal (NLS), cAMP response element (CREB) binding protein (CBP)/P300 binding motifs, and nuclear export signal (NES) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>).

Tax4 does not contain a PDZ domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>), suggesting that like HTLV-2, HTLV-4 may possibly be less pathogenic than HTLV-1.</p><p>Besides Tax and Rex, two additional ORFs encoding four proteins, p27<sup>I</sup>, p12<sup>I</sup>, p30<sup>II</sup>, and p13<sup>II </sup>(where I and II denote ORFI and ORFII, respectively), have been identified in the pX region of HTLV-1 and are important in viral infectivity and replication, T-cell activation, and cellular gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Analysis of the pX region of HTLV-4(1863LE) revealed a total of five additional putative ORFs (named I-V, respectively) encoding predicted proteins of 101, 161, 99, 133, and 115 aa in length (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). Since none of the potential ORFs begin with methionine start codons, we determined potential splice junctions in the HTLV-4 genome to ascertain the potential for novel ORFs via complex splicing mechanisms. Prediction of splice junction positions in HTLV-4 identified only two donor sites with high confidence, one at nucleotide 414 in the LTR (sd-LTR) and one at nucleotide 5105 in Env (sd-Env) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). Three additional putative splice acceptor sites were identified at nucleotides 7274 (sa-pX2) and 7645 (sa-pX3), and in Tax/Rex at nucleotide 7245 (sa-T/R). The sa-T/R is used with the sd-Env to generate the Tax and Rex proteins via complex splicing mechanisms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Rex mRNA is predicted to be spliced using sd/sa sites in a different reading frame than Tax and with a different methionine start codon (nucleotide positions 5043 &#x02013; 5105 and 7120 &#x02013; 7566) to generate a 170 aa protein. Tax mRNA is spliced from nucleotide positions 5102 &#x02013; 5105 and 7120 &#x02013; 8150 to generate a protein predicted to be 345 aa in length. Two potential accessory proteins 68 and 93 aa in length are then predicted using the sd-Env and either the sa-pX2 or sa-pX3 in ORFIV or ORFV, respectively (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). The HTLV-4 ORFIV protein shared 75% similarity with the HTLV-1p13<sup>II </sup>and HTLV-2 p28<sup>II </sup>accessory proteins but was missing the mitochondrial targeting sequence and the active region typically located at the amino-terminus of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). Interestingly, 19 of 26 (73%) amino acids in the HTLV-4 ORFIV (positions 4&#x02013;29) were identical to similar ORFs from all other major PTLVs, suggesting a conserved functionality of this motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). The predicted HTLV-4 ORFV protein shared only weak similarity (41%) to the carboxyl-terminus of the HTLV-2 p28X<sup>II </sup>protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). In contrast to the HTLV-4 ORFIV and ORFV proteins, the predicted HTLV-4 ORFI, ORFII, and ORFIII proteins did not share significant sequence identity with any PTLV accessory proteins, but shared weak sequence similarity with only miscellaneous microbial proteins available in GenBank such as <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>histidine kinase (37% similarity) (data not shown).

The carboxyl terminus of the HBZ ORF contains a 21 aa arginine rich region that is relatively conserved in PTLV and known cellular bZIP transcription factors, followed by a less conserved leucine zipper region that possesses five or four highly conserved leucine heptads in HTLV-1 and all other PTLVs, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>). HTLV-1 has five leucine heptads similar to that found in mammalian bZIP proteins, while all other PTLVs, including PTLV-4, have four leucine heptads followed by leucine octet (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>). In PTLVs, the first residue in the initial leucine heptad is a nonpolar amino acid other than leucine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>).

We show that the genome of this novel human virus is genetically equidistant from HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3. Robust phylogenetic and molecular clock analysis confirms that HTLV-4 clearly falls outside the diversity of PTLV-1, PTLV-2, and PTLV-3, demonstrating that HTLV-4 is the only known member of a distinct PTLV group we call PTLV-4. Combined, these results strongly support the HTLV-4/PTLV-4 nomenclature proposed for this virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The phylogenetic stability seen across HTLV-4 and other PTLV genomes also demonstrates the absence of major recombination events occurring in PTLV despite evidence of dual infections in humans and primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Furthermore, these results support the distinct evolutionary history of HTLV-4 and other PTLVs demonstrating that they are not recent genetic recombinants from pre-existing viral genomes. This finding contrasts with other retroviruses like HIV in which frequent recombination contributes substantially to genetic diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>Bayesian MCMC statistical methods have recently been developed to accurately infer dates of evolutionary events, to investigate the origin of viral epidemics, and to estimate historical population dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Molecular dating of the HTLV-4 predecessor using these robust methods suggests that this novel PTLV lineage originated almost 200 millennia ago, which predates the inferred origin of the ancestors of HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3 by about 76,000 &#x02013; 191,000 ya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Two equally parsimonious hypotheses on the origin of HTLV-4 can thus be proposed by the inferred ancient existence of the PTLV-4 lineage. First, it is possible that HTLV-4(1863LE) is a current descendent of the ancestral PTLV-4 that infected humans as they evolved in Africa and represents a strain circulating within humans living in this geographic region. Interestingly, the inferred date of the HTLV-4 ancestor also coincides with the appearance of <italic>Homo sapiens sapiens</italic>, estimated to have occurred around 200 &#x02013; 400 K ya, suggesting the emergent human lineage may have been a suitable host for the ancestral PTLV-4. If this is not just an evolutionary historical coincidence of both virus and host, then HTLV-4 may indeed be the oldest human deltaretrovirus as inferred from the molecular dating of all four HTLV groups. Alternatively, HTLV-4(1863LE) could also be the result of a more recent zoonotic infection with a very divergent STLV present in NHPs in the forests of Cameroon. Additional information on the diversity of HTLV-4 and its likely simian counterpart will be needed to determine whether HTLV-4(1863LE) truly originated as <italic>H. sapiens sapiens </italic>evolved, and persists in humans today, or represents a more recent zoonotic transmission from an NHP. As of yet, a simian counterpart of HTLV-4 has not been identified in Cameroon or elsewhere despite the identification of other novel STLVs in this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Nonetheless, the inability to find "STLV-4" may be due to sampling and screening biases in the selection of NHP species and the geographic locations examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The inference of an ancient split of HTLV-4(1863LE) from the PTLV-2 lineage, combined with the wide geographic distribution of STLVs and a history of STLVs crossing into humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], all imply that HTLV-4 infection may be more prevalent. Repeated and historical cross-species infections of humans with various STLV-1 strains led to the emergence and dissemination of several HTLV-1 subtypes in West-Central Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Similar evidence suggests that the newly identified HTLV-3 infections also potentially arose from multiple, independent past or contemporary introductions of different STLV-3 strains into humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Given that both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 followed human population migrations out of Africa and across the globe as humans evolved, HTLV-4 and HTLV-3 may also have spread globally. A more precise determination of the origin and distribution of HTLV-4 infection will require further studies, such as expanded surveillance in both humans and NHPs. However, serosurveys for HTLV-4 may be complicated by the inability to discriminate this infection from HTLV-2 since they both show similar WB profiles and the sensitivity of serological assays for identifying HTLV-4 is currently unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thus, additional diagnostic tools are required to determine the level of HTLV-4 penetration into the general population and to search for the potential primate origin of HTLV-4(1863LE). Screening for HTLV-4 will be facilitated by the development and application of serologic and molecular assays based on the sequences reported here. For example, since the HTLV-4 Gag matrix and nucleocapsid and the envelope surface proteins are divergent from PTLV-1, PTLV-2, and PTLV-3 it may be possible to use them in serologic assays to differentiate the four PTLV groups.</p><p>Virus classification is a topic of ongoing discussion and suggestions for nomenclature are typically based on lumping or splitting of taxa into distinct groups. Deltaretrovirus species are classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) by differences in genome sequence and viral oncogenes, antigenic properties, natural host range, and pathogenicity. For example, HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are distinguished mostly by phylogenetic diversity and variable disease outcomes of each virus. Recently, a new deltaretrovirus species, STLV-5, was proposed based on limited analyses of small <italic>tax/rex </italic>sequences from a <italic>Macaca arctoides </italic>(strain MarB43) that was originally classified as STLV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Herein, we show by using robust phylogenetic analysis of major coding regions and complete viral genomes that expansion of the current PTLV nomenclature from four to six putative major taxonomic species or groups should be considered. Our natural classification of PTLV groups is based on rigorous phylogenetic inference that demonstrates with high confidence the formation of very distinctive monophyletic lineages outside the diversity of all known viral groups, combined with genetic distances demonstrating the putative new lineage is nearly equidistant from all previously characterized groups, and the placement of the new PTLV groups near the root of the PTLV phylogeny. The first four PTLV phylogroups consist of HTLV-1/STLV-1, HTLV-2, HTLV-3/STLV-3, and HTLV-4. We confirm the existence of the putative STLV-5(MarB43) lineage, while the sixth group consists of the STLV-2(PanP) and STLV-2(PP1664) viruses. However, for simplicity we suggest maintaining the STLV-2 nomenclature historically used for this particular viral group. Each proposed new viral group clearly falls outside the diversity of their nearest PTLV relatives (PTLV-1 and HTLV-2, respectively), is monophyletic with strong bootstrap support and posterior probabilities, and are all roughly genetically equidistant from other PTLVs, and hence should all be classified as distinct viral species. As with all viral nomenclature, PTLV classification as proposed here will require approval of ICTV.</p><p>In addition to understanding viral evolutionary history, analysis of full-length genomes can also provide basic information on the replication and pathogenic potential of new viruses. Thus, we examined in detail the genetic structure and sequence of HTLV-4 to determine if important functional motifs involved in viral expression and HTLV-induced leukemogenesis are preserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. All enzymatic, regulatory, and structural proteins are well conserved in HTLV-4(1863LE), including conserved functional motifs in Tax that are important for viral gene expression and T-cell proliferation, suggesting HTLV-4 is replication competent. We also observed several important molecular features of the HTLV-4 genome involved in viral expression and pathogenicity that are either similar or distinct from other HTLVs. For example, the absence of a PDZ domain in the Tax protein of HTLV-4(1863LE), known to be important in cellular signal transduction and T-cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], is similar to what is seen in HTLV-2 but not in HTLV-1 and HTLV-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The absence of PDZ suggests that the HTLV-4 Tax may be more phenotypically similar to the HTLV-2 than the HTLV-1 Tax. Furthermore, the high amino acid identity of the Tax4 and Tax2 proteins also suggests that Tax4 may function similarly to Tax2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, whether the absence of a PDZ domain in HTLV-4 is associated with an absence of specific cellular and/or clinical outcomes like HTLV-2 will require further investigation.</p><p>We also identified unique putative c-Myb and Pbx-1 transcription factor binding sites in the U3 region of the LTR of HTLV-4(1863LE). c-Myb is a proto-oncogene that is expressed in T cells induced by mitogen or antigenic stimulation and is involved in cell cycle progression and proliferation of T lymphocytes, such that continuous deregulation of cell cycling may play a role in leukemogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. c-Myb has been shown to bind to the HTLV-1 and feline leukemia virus LTRs to increase viral transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Like c-Myb, dysregulation of the homeoprotein Pbx-1 can also increase leukemogenesis by disturbing hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. We demonstrate here that the potential c-Myb binding site in the HTLV-4 LTR specifically binds c-Myb, suggesting that it may also promote LTR-mediated viral expression and which may help overcome the loss of the distal 21-bp repeat element observed in the HTLV-4 LTR. For example, Pbx-1 has been demonstrated to up-regulate transcription of another retrovirus, murine leukemia virus (MuLV), by binding to conserved Pbx-1 transcription factor sites present in MuLV LTRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The presence of putative c-Myb and Pbx-1 binding sites in the HTLV-4 LTR may provide novel mechanisms of transcriptional control at both the viral and cellular levels not previously known for HTLV. Nevertheless, involvement of the putative novel binding sites in viral transcription and leukemogenesis will require additional studies.</p><p>Although originally reported to be exclusive to HTLV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], we now provide additional evidence for a putative HBZ region among all PTLVs, including HTLV-4(1863LE). Despite the absence of canonical bZIP domains, preliminary experiments show that proteins are transcribed from the HTLV-3, and -4 antisense mRNAs and all were potent inhibitors of Tax induction of HTLV LTR activity with similar cellular localizations like that of the HTLV-1 HBZ (unpublished data). These results not only confirm the predicted HBZ sequences and proteins in these viruses but also demonstrate the potential importance of HBZ in PTLV replication. The finding of a potential bZIP region on the antisense strand of all PTLV genomes also indicates that the nomenclature for this protein should be renamed from HBZ to AEP for antisense encoding protein as suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The potential role of AEP in HTLV-induced oncogenesis may be less clear since HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection result in different clinical outcomes, while pathologies for HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 have not yet been reported. Additional studies are required to confirm the potential effect of the predicted AEP transcripts and proteins on HTLV-4 and PTLV expression and any role they may have on leukemogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The novel HTLV-4 genome independently evolved from an ancient deltaretrovirus lineage and contains many of the functional motifs important for viral expression and possibly oncogenesis, including two novel transcription factor binding sites in the LTR. More studies are needed to further characterize the unique molecular features of HTLV-4 identified here, and to determine whether HTLV-4 is endemic and pathogenic in humans to better understand the public health importance of this novel human virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>DNA preparation and PCR-based genome walking</title><p>DNA was prepared from uncultured PBMCs available from person 1863LE identified in the original PTLV surveillance study in Cameroon reported in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. DNA integrity was confirmed by &#x003b2;-actin polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. All DNA preparation and PCR assays were performed in a laboratory where only human specimens are processed and tested according to recommended precautions to prevent contamination. To obtain the full-length genomic sequence of HTLV-4 we first PCR-amplified small regions of each major coding region by using nested PCR and degenerate PTLV primers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The <italic>tax </italic>(730-bp), polymerase (<italic>pol</italic>) (662-bp), and envelope (<italic>env</italic>) (319-bp) sequences were amplified by using primers and conditions provided elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. An additional short HTLV-4 sequence, 440-bp in length, that overlaps the end of <italic>tax </italic>and the beginning of the 3'LTR was amplified using standard PCR conditions and 45&#x000b0;C annealing with the external primers PGTAXF7a 5'TGATGGIWSICCIATGATTTCCGG 3', PGTAXF7b 5'TGATGGGTCTCCTATGATTTCCGG3' and PGTATA1+2R1 5'TCCTGAACYGTCYYYRCGCTTTTATAG3' and the internal primers PGTAXF8 5'TGCCCIAARIMIGGICAGCCATCTTT3' and PGTATA1+2R1.</p><p>HTLV-4(1863LE)-specific primers were then designed from sequences obtained in each of the four viral regions described above and were used in nested, long-template PCRs (Expand High Fidelity kit containing both Taq and Tgo DNA polymerases (Roche)) to fill in the gaps in the genome as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.

Examination of functional genetic motifs involved in viral expression, regulation, and HTLV-induced oncogenesis was done by detailed comparison of the HTLV-4 genome with full-length PTLV sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].

Secondary structure of the LTR RNA was determined using the program RNAstructure v4.2 program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Comparison of full-length PTLV genomes available at GenBank and determination of genetic recombination was done using HTLV-4(1863LE) as the query sequence and the F84 (maximum likelihood) model and a transition/transversion ratio of 2.28 implemented in the program SimPlot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].

Unequal nucleotide composition was measured by using the TREE-PUZZLE program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Phylogenetic trees were inferred with the parameters estimated from the Clustal W [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] sequence alignments of each gene and the full-length genome after removing indels by using Modeltest v3.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] and Neighbor-Joining (NJ) methods in the MEGA v4.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] program and maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis in PAUP* [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>], TREE-PUZZLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], and PhyML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. The reliability of the inferred tree topology was tested with 100 (PAUP*) to 1000 bootstrap replicates (NJ and PhyML) or 100,000 puzzling steps (TREE-PUZZLE). Trees were viewed and edited using FigTree v1.1.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>PTLV evolutionary rates and divergence times</title><p>In order to estimate a reliable divergence time for the cenancestor (most recent common ancestor) of the HTLV-4(1863LE) lineage, we generated separate alignments of <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>pol</italic>, <italic>env</italic>, and <italic>tax </italic>genes from all full-length PTLV genomes available at GenBank by using Clustal W. Sequence gaps and 3<sup>rd </sup>codon positions were removed, and minor adjustments in the alignment were made manually. The best fitting evolutionary model for the aligned sequences was determined using a hierarchical likelihood ratio test as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. A variant of the GTR model, allowing four different substitution rate categories (r<sub>A&#x02194;C </sub>= r<sub>A&#x02194;T </sub>= r<sub>G&#x02194;T </sub>= 1, r<sub>A&#x02194;G </sub>= 9.35, r<sub>C&#x02194;G </sub>= 0.67, r<sub>C&#x02194;T </sub>= 5.79), with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity (a = 0.694) and an estimated proportion of invariable sites (0.185), was determined to best fit the data.</p><p>The molecular clock hypothesis, or constant rate of evolution, for the PTLV tree was tested with the likelihood ratio test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Likelihoods were calculated using the best fitting nucleotide substitution model either with or without the enforcement of the global clock constraint with the program PAML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. The PTLV evolutionary rate assuming the global molecular clock model was estimated by using the divergence time of 40,000 &#x02013; 60,000 years ago (ya) for the Melanesian HTLV-1 lineage (HTLV-1mel) and 12,000&#x02013;30,000 ya for the most recent common ancestor of HTLV-2a/HTLV-2b native American strains according to the formula: evolutionary rate (<italic>r</italic>) = branch length (<italic>bl</italic>)/divergence time (<italic>t</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Such divergence dates were based on well-established genetic and archaeological evidence suggesting that ancestors of indigenous Melanesians and Australians migrated from Southeast Asia or the introduction of ancestral indigenous Indians into North America via the Bering Straight during those times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The evolutionary rate was also estimated by employing a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) molecular clock method, allowing for either a strict or a relaxed molecular clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], implemented in the BEAST software package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. For each analysis, we used the calibration dates discussed above as a strong prior for the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the HTLV-1Mel/HTLV-1a,b and HTLV-2a,b lineages, respectively. In practice, the upper and lower divergence times estimated from anthropological data were used to define the interval of a strong uniform prior distribution from which the MCMC sampler would sample possible divergence times for the corresponding node in the tree. For each model, the Bayesian calculation consisted of three independent 100,000,000 generations MCMC with sampling every 1,000<sup>th </sup>generation. Convergence of the MCMC was assessed by calculating the effective sampling size (ESS) of the runs using the program Tracer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. All parameter estimates showed significant ESSs (&#x0003e;150). The tree with the maximum product of the posterior clade probabilities (maximum clade credibility tree) was chosen from the posterior distribution of 5,000 sampled trees (after burning in the first 5001 sampled trees) with the program TreeAnnotator version 1.4.6 included in the BEAST software package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. Both the constant coalescent and Yule Process were used as tree priors and gave identical results.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA transfection</title><p>Approximately 1 million 293 cells were seeded on a 100 mm dish and incubated for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C.
