Populations are aging in most high income countries, resulting in a further increase of non-communicable diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This accumulation of prevalent non-communicable diseases and their sequelae represent a major challenge for health service capacities and financial resources. Policy makers need evidence based advice for decisions on potential interventions and population based prevention strategies.</p><p>While publications often report estimates of individual associations such as relative risks or odds ratios, attributable fractions (AFs) are infrequently reported. The AF quantifies the proportion of cases that can be attributed to a certain risk factor for a specific disease, for example, the proportion of lung cancer cases attributable to smoking. Smokers have a highly increased risk of lung cancer. However, this individual risk does not give any information on the relevance of smoking for lung cancer in a population also containing nonsmokers. AFs help assessing a potential impact of preventive interventions on population health.</p><p>A number of risk factors for non-communicable diseases have been established such as hypertension for cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Multivariable logistic regression has become a standard procedure to provide valid estimates of individual risk studies. Similar methods, however, have rarely been applied for AFs, although corresponding approaches have been described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Their infrequent application in public health research might particularly be due to lacking inclusion of their estimates in statistical software packages.</p><p>The main aim of this paper is to illustrate the use of AFs by comparing different approaches estimating AFs. Therefore we used established risk factors of cardiovascular disease in the 2005&#x02013;2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for illustration purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Additionally, we provide functions/macros for the frequently used statistical software packages R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], SAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and STATA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], allowing readers to recalculate the results shown and moreover, to encourage readers to calculate and report adjusted AFs of their own research observations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Definition of the attributable risk</title><p>Throughout this paper, we refer to the attributable fraction (AF). A risk factor strongly associated with the disease, but infrequently prevalent in the population, is less relevant compared with a risk factor of similar effect magnitude affecting a larger proportion of the population. The AF considers both, the individual association and the exposure frequency and thus, allows to estimate the relevance of a risk factor for a disease in a population. The definition of AFs used in this paper reflects the proportion of cases that can be attributed to a certain risk factor in a population.</p></sec><sec><title>Levin's formula</title><p>One of the most frequently applied approaches calculating the AF is the Levin formula. It is named after its first describer who introduced the concept of calculating attributable risks in 1953 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The idea is to separate the number of cases into expected and excess cases. The expected cases are calculated under the assumption that the proportion of cases should be equal among the exposed and unexposed. The cases among the exposed exceeding the expected number of cases based on the estimate derived from the prevalence of the disease among the unexposed are supposed to be cases attributable to the risk factor. Based on this assumption Levin described a formula that requires only the relative risk estimate (<italic>RR</italic>) and the prevalence of the risk factor (<italic>p</italic>):</p><p><disp-formula><mml:math id="M1" name="1471-2288-9-7-i1" overflow="scroll"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x022c5;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x022c5;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The relative risk is often approximated by the odds ratio e.g. in cross-sectional studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Plug-in and Bruzzi's method</title><p>One approach sometimes used to adjust AFs for other known risk factors considers adjusted odds ratio estimates from multivariable logistic regression analysis in Levin's formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This approach has a couple of disadvantages as we outline in the discussion section. Another approach using logistic regression estimates was suggested by Bruzzi et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This method provides adjusted AFs and was originally presented for case-control data but can also be applied in cross-sectional studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequential and average AF</title><p>The concept of obtaining AFs directly from logistic regression was introduced by Greenland and Drescher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The basic idea behind this approach is to estimate a logistic regression model with all known/available risk factors. The AF of the risk factor of interest is then calculated as follows:</p><p>1. The risk factor has to be coded dichotomously. It is 'removed' from the population by classifying all individuals as unexposed, irrespective of their real status.</p><p>2. A logistic model using this modified dataset is used to estimate predicted probabilities for each individual:</p><p><disp-formula><mml:math id="M2" name="1471-2288-9-7-i2" overflow="scroll"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02061;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>&#x003b1;</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mo>'</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where &#x003b1; represents the estimate for the intercept of the logistic regression model, &#x003b2; denotes the parameter vector for the covariates included in the model, and <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i </italic></sub>denoting the observations of the covariates for each individual, however, with the 'removed' covariate set to zero for all individuals.</p><p>3. The sum of all predicted probabilities is the adjusted number of cases of the disease that would be expected if the risk factor was absent in the population.</p><p>4. The AF is then calculated by subtracting these expected cases from the observed cases and dividing by the observed cases.</p><p>This procedure can be repeated for any dichotomous risk factor in the logistic regression model. It is also applicable when removing risk factors sequentially from the model and has been called 'sequential attributable fraction' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, when using the latter approach, the result is sensitive to the order of the risk factor removal from the model.</p><p>The dependence on the removal sequence can be simply addressed. If the risk factors are removed in every possible order and averaged over all obtained AFs, the average estimate does not depend on the order sequence anymore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This approach has to be repeated <italic>k</italic>! times with <italic>k </italic>as the number of risk factors in the model.

Average AFs seem to provide the most plausible estimates of the approaches examined.</p><p>The results derived from the models are in accordance with the evidence for cardiovascular risk factors. Like others we observed cholesterol levels, hypertension, smoking and diabetes as important cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Our approach additionally allows assessing the impact of these risk factors on population level.</p><p>The approach with the most plausible results, the average AF has the advantage of not adding up to more than 100%. In contrast, the simple Levin approach often yields cumulative AFs of more than 100%. Some authors argue that this makes sense since an individual can have several risk factors and the disease can be therefore prevented in several ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, if there are a considerable number of risk factors which are possibly correlated, it is obvious that unadjusted AFs from bivariate analyses may be biased providing an overestimation of the preventive potential and adjusted AFs should be rather considered.</p><p>Unfortunately there is no test statistic or other indicator of the appropriateness of a certain model including the covariates considered. The appropriateness of a model should be considered as regards content. The need to develop the 'most appropriate model' to investigate the research question, thus, remains the top priority since the overall AF and AFs of single risk factors possibly change after withdrawal of risk factors due to confounding or risk factors on the causal pathway. For example, hypertension as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease might be on the causal pathway of smoking related pathologies or confounded by smoking or an independent risk factor. Risk factors on the causal pathway of other considered risk factors should be omitted from respective models. To assess if hypertension is on the causal pathway of smoking similar decisions have to be made as in the estimation of individual risk factors. Since e.g. the AF for smoking status was similar in the model containing and not containing hypertension, hypertension does not seem to be exclusively on the causal pathway of the effect of smoking on cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Surprisingly, the approach of average AFs has only rarely been applied. The original article by Eide, published in 1995 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], has been cited 46 times according to ISI web of knowledge (22<sup>nd </sup>September 2008). Among these 44 citations there are 11 self-citations, 15 papers with methodological considerations, and only 20 articles applying the approach. The low number of applications might be due to the lack of inclusion of this method in statistical program packages. Therefore we provide functions/macros for commonly used statistical programs to encourage other researchers to calculate average AFs [see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>].</p><sec><title>Methodological Considerations</title><p>The accuracy of AF estimates by the algorithms presented in this paper still depends on the completeness of the multivariable model. If important confounders are not considered in the model, an overestimation of AFs can occur similarly to an overestimation of individual risk factors in multivariable regression models. Other potential confounders might not be considered in our model leaving only 10% of cases for factors like heredity and all other environmental factors together. However, such a bias is only dependent on the number of covariates considered and not on the applied method.</p><p>The functions provided for calculating adjusted AFs in the appendix are based on logistic regression analysis. They do not allow for consideration of continuous explanatory variables within the model e.g. age in years. Consideration of continuous covariates is theoretically possible and is a matter of programming. However, an AF for a continuous variable might be difficult to communicate. Calculating an AF for the mean or an inter-quartile range of a continuous variable provides an estimate for a pre-defined but possibly arbitrary parameter change.</p><p>Although the approach of calculating AFs with the Levin formula and adjusted odds ratios from logistic regression has been shown to yield inconsistent estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], we used this approach for illustration and comparison to other approaches and do not recommend it due to biased estimates.</p><p>The calculation of average AFs as discussed and favored in this paper requires access to original observational data. When using the method of average AFs in this paper, it is not possible to estimate adjusted average AFs by published aggregated data as for example in Levin's equation. Following this consideration, combined estimates from several studies (e.g. results from a meta-analysis) cannot be considered in average AFs as proposed in this paper. Although, such a combined estimate may be less subject to variation due to a higher sample size, such a combining of possibly biased estimates does not consider adjustment for confounding. Therefore, average AFs from original data remains important due to control for confounding even if only one data set is available.</p><p>The results generated from an adjusted AF model for a specific population may not be fitting to settings in other populations. This is likely to be due to varying prevalence of risk factors. Additionally, AFs in other populations may differ due to the impact of additional age or ethnic groups that were not included in the original sample. For inferences on population level analyses should be based on representative data from the population of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Preventive strategies in populations have to take into account the magnitude of targeted risk factors and their prevalence in the population for which the respective intervention is planned. The concept of average AFs provides a useful tool to address these issues. Application of simple formulas such as the Levin formula, however, may yield considerable overestimation of potential population impact of specific interventions. The estimation may be improved by the application of average AFs.
