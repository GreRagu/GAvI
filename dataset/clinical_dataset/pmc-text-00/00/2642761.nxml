It was originally identified as a lifespan-extending gene when over-expressed in budding yeast, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. There are seven homologues of SIRT (named SIRT1-7) in mammals, and SIRT1 is the homologue closest to Sir2. Post-translational modification of proteins, like acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, plays a pivotal role in the biological functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recently, several lines of evidence have indicated that SIRT1 regulates various functions such as cellular survival, differentiation, and metabolism by modulating key targets via deacetylation. These targets include FOXO, Ku70, p53, NF-&#x003ba;B, PGC-1&#x003b1; (PPAR-gamma co-activator 1-alpha) and PPAR&#x003b3; (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3;). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The knockout of SIRT1 is not embryonic lethal however most null mice die in the perinatal period, exhibiting growth retardation and developmental defects in various tissues including eye, lung, pancreas, heart, and reproductive system[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This indicates that SIRT1 plays a pivotal role in the development of multiple organ systems. Furthermore, SIRT1 protects neuron from neurodegeneration in cell-based models of Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Wallerian degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanism by which SIRT1 functions in the central nervous system (CNS) or in the development remains unclear. In this study, to identify interacting partners for SIRT1, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening on human fetal brain cDNA library. We found that zyxin is one of binding partners for SIRT1.</p><p>Zyxin is primarily localized at the focal adhesion plaque complex as an adaptor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Zyxin contains a proline-rich domain at the N-terminus and three LIM domains at the C-terminus that are cysteine-rich motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. Zyxin interacts with cytoskeleton-related proteins, including &#x003b1;-actinin, Mena/VASP, CRP, and H-warts/LATS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and signaling molecules, including Vav, CasL, and p130<sup>Cas </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Focal adhesion plaques, where cells interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM), form a structure where multiple interactions and signal transduction networks crosstalk. This not only regulates cell adhesion, spreading, and motility but also transduces signals into the nucleus to regulate gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. LIM domain proteins, including two related subfamily prototypes zyxin and paxillin, have been implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction to convey signals from the ECM to the nucleus at the focal adhesion plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It was recently reported that zyxin can shuttle between the cytosol and the nucleus, where it could affect transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, nuclear-accumulated zyxin executes anti-apoptotic function in cooperation with Akt in myocardiac cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of new binding partner for SIRT1</title><p>Human SIRT1 encodes 748 amino acids protein with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the N-terminus (aa 41&#x02013;46) and a sirtuin homology domain at the center (aa 261&#x02013;447); this domain is a conserved catalytic domain for deacetylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We performed yeast two-hybrid screening on human fetal brain cDNA library. SIRT1 is reported to perform functions by modulating various targets via deacetylation. We used the human SIRT1 aa 185&#x02013;505 region, including the conserved sirtuin catalytic domain, as bait. Through this screening, we found several possible interacting partners for SIRT1 (data not shown). Among them, five clones were identical to human zyxin. Recent studies have shown that zyxin can shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and that it performs anti-apoptotic function in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; these are characteristic features that zyxin shares with SIRT1. Therefore, we decided to perform a functional analysis to study the interaction between SIRT1 and zyxin.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Interaction between SIRT1 and zyxin in yeast</bold>. (A) Schematic representations of SIRT1 are shown with the sirtuin homology domain. The bar below the SIRT1 structure shows the region used as the bait domain in the yeast two-hybrid system. (B) Schematic diagram of zyxin and its deletion mutants are shown with their domain structures and representative binding partners. (C) In the yeast two-hybrid binding assay, the yeast reporter line (AH109) was co-transformed with plasmids encoding the SIRT1 catalytic domain and various zyxin deletion mutants on a 4-DO (drop out) medium. The line was photographed after 14 days of incubation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-10-6-1"/></fig><p>Human zyxin encodes 572 amino acids protein with two major domains: the N-terminal half domain including the proline-rich region and nuclear export signal or nuclear exclusive signal (NES) and three consecutive C-terminal LIM domains (LIM1-3) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Previous reports have shown the binding regions for &#x003b1;-actinin, Ena/VASP, CRP, and h-warts/LATS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], as described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. Since all identified zyxin clones in our screening contained a C-terminal region and since the LIM domain was implicated in protein-protein interaction, we conducted mapping assays concentrating on the LIM domain of zyxin. To map the precise region for zyxin to bind to SIRT1, a yeast two-hybrid assay was performed using the SIRT1 catalytic domain (aa 185&#x02013;505) as bait and various shorter zyxin fragments as prey. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, colonies appeared only when the yeast reporter line (AH109) containing the SIRT1 catalytic domain was transformed with the plasmid encoding the zyxin aa 176&#x02013;572 region on a 4-DO (drop out) medium lacking adenine, histidine, leucin, and tryptophan. Furthermore, these colonies exhibit LacZ+ phenotype on &#x003b2;-Gal assay, indicating that the LIM3 domain (aa 501&#x02013;572) is required for binding to the SIRT1 catalytic domain. Interestingly, we could not detect any colonies where the yeast reporter line (AH109) containing the SIRT1 catalytic domain was transformed with plasmid encoding full-length zyxin on a 4-DO medium. A previous study showed that full-length zyxin interacts with h-warts/LATS1 <italic>in vivo </italic>but not <italic>in vitro</italic>, raising the possibility that LIM1/2 domains are masked in full-length zyxin and some modification might be critical for their interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Based on these data, the LIM3 domain is essential for the interaction between SIRT1 and zyxin in yeast; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that some modification might play a pivotal role for the interaction in physiological conditions.</p><p>To further confirm the region of binding of zyxin to SIRT1, we performed a pull-down assay using bacterially expressed recombinant GST-SIRT1 and various fragments of HA-tagged zyxin expressed in HEK293T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The same amount of GST-SIRT1 fusion proteins bound to glutathione sepharose beads was incubated with various HA-tagged shorter zyxin fragments <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the retained proteins were immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. As shown in the top panel in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, we could detect weak signals in lane 2 and strong signals in lane 6, suggesting that GST-SIRT1 binds to hZyx 375&#x02013;572 aa (&#x00394;2) weakly and 444&#x02013;572 aa (&#x00394;4) strongly <italic>in vitro</italic>. We found strong signals in lane 3 in the top panel in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, indicating nonspecific binding for hZyx 375&#x02013;503 aa (&#x00394;3) to GST and/or glutathione-sepharose beads. Therefore, we could not assess the interaction between hZyx 375&#x02013;503 aa (&#x00394;3) and GST-SIRT1. We also could not assess the interaction between SIRT1 and hZyx 444&#x02013;503 (&#x00394;6), since we could detect no signals in lanes 9 and 10 in the middle panel of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>. This suggested that hZyx 444&#x02013;503 (&#x00394;6) protein might be unstable in HEK293T cells. In addition, we found nonspecific binding of full-length zyxin to GST and/or glutathione-sepharose beads and no signals for the product of hZyx 1&#x02013;378 aa (&#x00394;1) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), therefore we could not assess the interactions for these proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that zyxin interacts with SIRT1 directly <italic>in vitro </italic>and that the LIM2-3 region of zyxin might be critical for binding to SIRT1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, which is consistent with the result that the LIM3 domain of zyxin is essential for binding to SIRT1 in yeast.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In vitro </italic>interaction of SIRT1 and zyxin</bold>.

HEK293T cells expressing the indicated zyxin-deletion mutant were lysed and the resulting lysates were incubated with GST-SIRT1 or control GST proteins immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads.

COS-7 cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged SIRT1 and GFP-zyxin. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, SIRT1 is primarily localized in the nucleus with a diffused pattern. GFP-zyxin, diffusedly localized in the cytosol with some puncta, accumulates in the nucleus after treatment with leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM1-mediated nuclear exportation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The treatment with LMB induced the accumulation of GFP-zyxin in the nucleus, where it is co-localized with SIRT1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). To further confirm the co-localization between SIRT1 and GFP-zyxin, we examined the co-localization using ZX and ZY sections taken by scanning confocal microscopy. As in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, Myc-tagged SIRT1 and GFP-zyxin are clearly co-localized in the nucleus. We then quantified the LMB-induced nuclear accumulation of zyxin. LMB treatment remarkably increases the number of COS-7 cells exhibiting nuclear-accumulated GFP-zyxin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that zyxin, basically localized in the cytosol, translocates into the nucleus, where it is co-localized with SIRT1 in COS-7 cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Leptomycin B treatment causes nuclear accumulation of zyxin and results in co-localization of SIRT1 with zyxin</bold>.

Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP or anti-HA antibody, followed by Western blot analysis with a reciprocal antibody. HA-tagged SIRT1 was detected in the immunoprecipitates with anti-GFP antibody only in the presence of LMB, but not in the absence of LMB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Furthermore, GFP-zyxin was also detected in the immunoprecipitates with anti-HA antibody only in the presence of LMB, but not in the absence of LMB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These data suggest that LMB induces the accumulation of GFP-zyxin in the nucleus, leading to the interaction between HA-tagged SIRT1 and GFP-zyxin probably in the nucleus. This is consistent with our morphological data that indicate SIRT1 and zyxin are co-localized in the nucleus with LMB treatment.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Interaction of SIRT1 with zyxin in mammalian cells</bold>.

GFP-zyxin was detected in the immunoprecipitates with anti-SIRT1 antibody, but not in those with control IgG, indicating the interaction between endogenous SIRT1 and exogenously overexpressed GFP-zyxin.

COS-7 cells were co-transfected with expressing plasmids encoding Myc-tagged SIRT1 and GFP-zyxin in the presence or absence of LMB, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody followed by Western blot analysis using anti-Ac-Lys antibody to monitor acetylation levels. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, the signals for acetylated GFP-zyxin were remarkably reduced in the presence of Myc-tagged SIRT (first panel, lanes 2 and 4) as compared with the control (first panel, lanes 1 and 3), suggesting that SIRT1 can deacetylate zyxin <italic>in vivo</italic>. The signals for acetylated GFP-zyxin without LMB treatment are stronger as compared to those with LMB treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, first panel), while the amounts of total GFP-zyxin protein in immunoprecipitates are comparable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, second panel). This suggests that SIRT1 could deacetylate nuclear-accumulated zyxin. To confirm the specificity of deacetylation by SIRT1, we performed an <italic>in vivo </italic>deacetylation assay using SIRT1 H363Y, a loss-of-function mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The signals for acetylated GFP-zyxin were remarkably enhanced by SIRT1 H363Y overexpression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>), indicating the specificity for deacetylation by SIRT1. To strengthen this result, we then examined the effect of SIRT1 inhibitor, nicotinamide (NAm), in an <italic>in vivo </italic>deacetylation assay. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing GFP-zyxin, with or without NAm treatment for 24 h, and GFP-zyxin was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. The deacetylation levels were monitored by a Western blot analysis with anti-Ac-Lys antibody. The signals for acetylated GFP-zyxin were remarkably enhanced in the presence of NAm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>), indicating the specificity of deacetylation by SIRT1. Taken together, these results clearly show that in mammalian cells, SIRT1 can modulate the deacetylation levels of zyxin, most likely in the nucleus.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study shows that zyxin is a novel interacting partner for SIRT1. SIRT1 and zyxin are co-localized in the nucleus after LMB treatment, suggesting that nuclear-accumulated zyxin interacts with SIRT1. SIRT1 and zyxin transcript are both preferentially expressed in developing mouse brain and various adult tissues, including lungs, spleen, and testis. Furthermore, SIRT1 deacetylates zyxin, especially after LMB treatment, raising the possibility that SIRT1 could modulate zyxin's functions in the nucleus via deacetylation. Zyxin-null mice exhibit almost no abnormal phenotype, probably due to genetic redundancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. On the other hand, SIRT1-null mice show growth retardation and developmental defects in various tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which suggests a critical role of SIRT1 in the developmental stage. Based on these reports, our data could raise the possibility that zyxin is one of the downstream effectors necessary for SIRT1 to execute some biological functions in the developing brain and various adult tissues.</p><p>There is an apparent contradiction between the yeast and mammalian results. Apparently SIRT1 does not bind to full length zyxin in yeast because of some hypothesized masking of the LIM3. However, the mammalian cell experiments do show apparent association between full-length zyxin and SIRT1. As mentioned above, a previous study showed that full-length zyxin interacts with h-warts/LATS1 <italic>in vivo </italic>but not <italic>in vitro</italic>, raising the possibility that LIM1/2 domains are masked in full-length zyxin and some modification might be critical for their interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore we also hypothesize some modification would be required for full-length zyxin to bind to SIRT1 in mammalian cells.</p><p>Then what is the biological function of the interaction between SIRT1 and zyxin? Cell survival effect is one of the features shared by these proteins. SIRT1 can protect neurons from oxidative stress in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], neurotoxicity in cell-based models for AD/tauopathies, ALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and Wallerian degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. SIRT1 expression levels are induced in mouse models of neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and moderate heart-specific overexpression of SIRT1 in mice delays aging of the heart by conferring resistance to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. On the other hand, nuclear-accumulated zyxin can protect cardiomyctes from oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These reports raise the possibility that the interaction of these proteins could be implicated in cellular survival, especially in the brain and heart, during physiological senescence. Since zyxin could affect transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and since nuclear-accumulated zyxin executes anti-apoptotic function cooperating with Akt in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], it is possible SIRT1 could modulate these functions of zyxin via deacetylation. Considering that SIRT1-null mice exhibit developmental defects with frequent exencephaly and retinal phenotype with abnormal proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], it is possible that the interaction of these proteins could be implicated in cellular survival pathways in the developmental stage.</p><p>In addition, shuttling between the cytosol and the nucleus is a characteristic feature shared by SIRT1 and zyxin. In this study, it was not determined whether the acetylation status of zyxin affects its cellular localization or whether deacetylated zyxin is retained in the nucleus. Recently, it was reported that nuclear zyxin, phosphorylated by Akt, interacts with acinus-S to prevent apoptosis and 14-3-3&#x003b3; plays a pivotal role in the nuclear translocation of zyxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The morphological studies in the present study show that zyxin is localized primarily in the cytosol with puncta and it accumulates in the nucleus only with the LMB treatment, but not with insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) or LY294002 treatment, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, in COS-7 cells (data not shown). This suggests that some unknown stimuli other than the IGF-1-Akt-related pathway could play a critical role for zyxin to translocate into the nucleus. The nuclear accumulation of zyxin is not induced by co-expression with SIRT1, suggesting that it is unlikely SIRT1 enhances the accumulation and/or translocation of zyxin into the nucleus. Since the sub-cellular localization of SIRT1 differs based on cell type and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], it is possible that SIRT1 could interact with zyxin in the cytosol depending on the cell type and differentiation.</p><p>ECM, beyond scaffolding functions, is responsible for transmitting environmental signals into cells, thereby essentially affecting all aspects of cell life, including its proliferation, differentiation, and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Since zyxin is considered to convey signals from ECM into the nucleus at the focal adhesion plaques, we now assume that SIRT1 could regulate the signal transmission from ECM into the nucleus by modulating zyxin's functions via deacetylation, thereby reflecting its biological functions.</p><p>Finally as described in above, several functional significances could be assumed for the interaction, including the cell survival effect especially in development and/or regulation of signal transmission from ECM into the nucleus. Actually we had performed experiments to investigate whether the interaction of these proteins could affect the apoptosis under stress condition or the transcriptional activity of zyxin in luciferase reporter gene assay (data not shown). Thus far, we could not obtain the result to indicate the biological significance of the interaction in such simple systems. Additional experiments are required to clarify the functional significance of the interaction in the future.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, zyxin could be a novel interacting partner of SIRT1. Zyxin is an adaptor protein at focal adhesion plaque, regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction to convey signal from the ECM (extracellular matrix) to the nucleus. Our results raise the possibility that SIRT1 regulates signal transmission from ECM to the nucleus by modulating the functions of zyxin via deacetylation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293T cells and African green monkey kidney fibroblast like cell line COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (50 U penicillin-streptomycin) at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere inside a humidified incubator.
