Adenocarcinoid is a rare but well recognised tumour of the appendix which exhibits features of both carcinoid and adenocarcinoma. We report a patient with combined adenocarcinoid and mucinous cystadenoma of the appendix. To the best of our knowledge, only six cases have been reported in the literature to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Case presentation</title><sec><title>Case report</title><p>A 71-year-old man presented to the surgical department with a 2-week history of colicky right iliac fossa pain and a 1-week history of diarrhoea. He did not have rectal bleeding or weight loss. On examination, he was found to have a right iliac fossa mass. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was &#x0003c;2 &#x003bc;g/L and the computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an appendiceal mass (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) without any surrounding lymph node enlargement. Laparoscopy showed an appendiceal mass with mucinous discharge and a laparoscopic appendicectomy was performed. Histology revealed both an adenocarcinoid involving the resected margin and a mucinous cystadenoma of the tip. The patient subsequently underwent a laparoscopic radical right hemicolectomy. The right colon and all of the 15 lymph nodes resected were clear of tumour.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Computed tomography scan showing appendix mucocele</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1752-1947-3-28-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Pathology</title><p>Macroscopically, the normal anatomy of the appendix was distorted with dilatation and mucocele formation. Histology revealed a mucinous cystadenoma involving the tip of the appendix. Proximally, the appendix was infiltrated by adenocarcinoid composed of islands of epithelial cells with abundant intracellular mucin and eosinophilic granules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The tumour measured at least 12 mm in maximum diameter with extension to the serosal surface and into the mesoappendix. The tumour was present at the surgical resection margin. Mucin stains were positive and immunohistochemical stains showed strong positivity for chromogranin, CD56 and CK20, whilst CK7 was negative. The resected right colon showed no residual tumour and the lymph nodes were not involved.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>(A) Mucinous cystadenoma and goblet cell carcinoid with hematoxylin and eosin (&#x000d7;200)</bold>.

It is widely known by different names such as goblet cell carcinoid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], crypt cell carcinoid, and amphicrine cell carcinoma. There is still debate about the origin of this tumour and several hypotheses exist, hence the various nomenclature. Adenocarcinoma arises from primordial endodermal elements while carcinoid arises from neural crest cells. Some authors suggest that goblet cell carcinoids arise from a pluripotent cell with divergent neuroendocrine and mucinous differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Mucinous cystadenoma is rare but is the commonest of the benign appendiceal tumours. It can present as appendicitis, mucocele or if the tumour ruptures, as pseudomyxoma peritonei. Treatment is usually appendicectomy with care taken not to spill the mucin intraperitoneally.</p><p>Adenocarcinoids account for 2% of primary appendiceal malignancies. Most tumours are less than 2 cm in diameter and 20% of them metastasize to the ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The mean age at presentation is 59 years and the 5-year survival rate ranges from 60% to 84% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The tumour usually spares the mucosa, infiltrates muscularis propria and peri-appendiceal fat and can stain positively for mucin, CEA, cytokeratin, lysozyme, chromogranin A, serotonin and synaptophysin. Goblet cell carcinoids have increased expression of NAP1L1, MAGE-D2, and MTA-1 genes compared with benign carcinoids. Ki 67 is a tumour marker which is expressed in higher levels in metastatic adenocarcinoids compared to localized ones. This can be useful in predicting tumour behaviour and subsequent surgical management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that goblet cell carcinoids have biological and immunohistochemical profiles more similar to adenocarcinoma than to classical carcinoids which may explain their more aggressive behaviour and therefore substantiate more extensive treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>There is ongoing surgical controversy as to whether appendicectomy or right hemicolectomy is necessary for appendiceal carcinoid tumours. For classical carcinoid tumours, most centres consider tumour size to be the main discretionary factor. Those &#x0003c;2 cm are usually treated with appendicectomy alone. For adenocarcinoids, right hemicolectomy is generally advised if any of the following features are present: tumours greater than 2 cm, involvement of resected margins, greater than 2 mitoses/10 high-power fields (hpf), extension of tumour beyond serosa, lymphovascular invasion or lymph node metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Some authors recommend right hemicolectomy for adenocarcinoids of any size due to their propensity to metastasize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], while others use similar determinative histological criteria as those for classical carcinoids to plan treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A meta-analysis of retrospective chart reviews by Varisco <italic>et al. </italic>evaluated the efficacy of appendicectomy versus hemicolectomy for localized adenocarcinoids. Their analysis suggests appendicectomy alone has a role in the treatment of localized tumours. However, in the presence of unfavourable features including moderate to severe atypia, involvement of caecum, and more than 2 mitoses per hpf, they recommend an interval hemicolectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Chemotherapy mostly with 5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin is advised for remnant disease after surgery. Cytoreductive surgery with intraperitoneal chemotherapy can offer improved survival for advanced peritoneal dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In female patients regardless of age, bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy is advocated, as there is a significant risk of ovarian involvement. Irrespective of the type of surgical intervention, all patients warrant lifelong colonoscopic surveillance.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.
