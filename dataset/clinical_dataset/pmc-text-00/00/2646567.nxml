PVs resist fusion with host cell endosomes and lysosomes and are thus distinct from phagosomes. Because the parasite remains sequestered within the PV, it is unclear how <italic>T. gondii</italic>&#x02013;derived antigens (Ag&#x02019;s) access the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway for presentation to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We demonstrate that recruitment of host endoplasmic reticulum (hER) to the PV in <italic>T. gondii</italic>&#x02013;infected dendritic cells (DCs) directly correlates with cross-priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, we document by immunoelectron microscopy the transfer of hER components into the PV, a process indicative of direct fusion between the two compartments. In strong contrast, no association between hER and phagosomes or Ag presentation activity was observed in DCs containing phagocytosed live or dead parasites. Importantly, cross-presentation of parasite-derived Ag in actively infected cells was blocked when hER retrotranslocation was inhibited, indicating that the hER serves as a conduit for the transport of Ag between the PV and host cytosol. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that pathogen-driven hER&#x02013;PV interaction can serve as an important mechanism for Ag entry into the MHC class I pathway and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cross-priming.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>DCs are specialized antigen (Ag)-presenting cells adept at loading peptides derived from exogenous proteins onto both MHC class I and II molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Although MHC class II loading occurs entirely within endosomes or lysosomes, the mechanism of cross-presentation on MHC class I is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Protein Ag&#x02019;s are thought to exit endocytic compartments and reach the cytosol for proteasomal processing. The resulting peptides are then translocated by the transporter associated with Ag processing (TAP) 1/TAP2 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; or possibly endosomes) for loading onto MHC class I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). The pathway of Ag presentation is particularly unclear for intracellular pathogens that dwell in vacuoles sequestered from the cytosol. An important example is provided by <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, an apicomplexan parasite that resides within a highly specialized parasitophorous vacuole (PV), which is known not to participate in endocytosis or recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Nevertheless, <italic>T. gondii</italic> mounts strong protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses required for persistent host infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>Tachyzoite-stage parasites infect host cells by an active process that involves the sequential discharge of secretory organelles (micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules), leading to the formation of a replication-permissive PV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Micronemal proteins secreted during the initial steps of invasion facilitate attachment to host cells, and this is followed by the discharge of rhoptries into the cytosol and the evolving PV. Proteins derived from dense granules then actively remodel the PV membrane (PVM), in turn rendering the PV incapable of endosome/lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). At the same time, <italic>T. gondii</italic> modifies the PVM to allow for nutrient acquisition by generating pores that permit free diffusion of small molecules &#x0003c;1.3 kD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), by recruiting host mitochondria and ER that may serve as a potential source of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) and by scavenging cholesterol from the host endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>).</p><p>Although the PVM provides a barrier for intact protein Ag escape, recent studies have indicated that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming by <italic>T. gondii</italic>&#x02013;infected cells requires TAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) as well as proteasomal processing, but is independent of endosomal pH and protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), arguing that it involves the cytosolic MHC class I machinery. In this study, we have directly investigated the pathway by which <italic>T. gondii</italic>&#x02013;derived Ag exits the PV for MHC class I presentation. We demonstrate that this process involves interconnectivity between the host ER (hER) and PV, and the subsequent retrotranslocation of parasite molecules into the host cell cytoplasm. In marked contrast, internalization of live or dead <italic>T. gondii</italic> into conventional phagosomes that do not fuse with ER fails to facilitate cross-presentation. Our findings thus implicate pathogen-driven recruitment of hER as an important route of entry for exogenous Ag&#x02019;s into the MHC class I pathway for <italic>T. gondii</italic> and, possibly, other vacuole-dwelling microbes.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming requires active infection</title><p>Previous work suggested that <italic>T. gondii</italic>&#x02013;derived Ag&#x02019;s access the host cell cytosol and there intersect the MHC class I pathway for cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). This could reflect the phagocytosis of infected cells or dead parasites by professional Ag-presenting cells (e.g., DCs) or the direct infection of DCs. Because a system to detect natural <italic>T. gondii</italic> CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes in common haplotypes was unavailable, we used as a model transgenic parasites expressing a truncated form of OVA, secreted via dense granules that release their contents inside the PV (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1</ext-link>), to track Ag-specific T cell responses to the parasite.</p><p>To determine whether active infection of DCs is required for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming in vivo, B6.SLJ congenic mice that had received purified CFSE-labeled naive transgenic OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for the OVA-derived peptide SIINFEKL were subsequently injected with live, live irradiated (irr), or paraformaldehyde-killed (fix) OVA-expressing <italic>T. gondii</italic> (TgOVA), TgOVA-infected MHC class I&#x02013;deficient (MHC-I<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) DCs, or the nontransgenic parental RH parasite strain. Draining lymph nodes were harvested 3 d after challenge and OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation was measured. The transferred cells were found to proliferate only in those mice that were challenged with live TgOVA or irr TgOVA (TgOVAirr) parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This T cell priming was not caused by the increased Ag load resulting from parasite replication, as nonmultiplying irr tachyzoites, which also form a PV, induced the same level of T cell activation. As an additional positive control, we showed that OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation is also observed in mice that received TgOVA-infected WT DCs (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1</ext-link>). Because MHC-I<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DCs that are as efficiently infected as their WT counterparts (Fig. S2 B) cannot directly present Ag to CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, these data support previous in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) indicating that direct infection rather than uptake of dead parasites or bystander infected cells is required for cross-presentation of <italic>T. gondii</italic>&#x02013;derived OVA. Similarly, only actively infected DCs stimulated IFN-&#x003b3; production from polyclonal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from nontransgenic mice infected with an avirulent strain of <italic>T. gondii</italic> (ME-49; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), suggesting that active infection is also required for cross-presentation of natural parasite Ag.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Only actively infected DCs cross-present <italic>T. gondii</italic>&#x02013;derived Ag to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</bold> (A) CFSE-labeled naive OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were transferred into congenic recipients, which were subsequently challenged with either live, live irr, or noninfective killed (fix) TgOVA, TgOVA&#x02013;infected MHC-I<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DCs (MHC-I<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> inf), nontransgenic parasites (Tg), or PBS. Proliferation of OT-I cells was measured 3 d later in the draining lymph nodes. (B) Purified CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from infected C57BL/6 mice were restimulated with DCs exposed to live Tgirr or TgHK tachyzoites, or to soluble parasite extract (STAg), and IFN-&#x003b3; production was measured by ELISA in 48-h supernatants.

After fixation, the parasite-exposed DCs were co-cultured with CFSE-labeled naive OT-I cells, and T cell proliferation was measured as a readout of Ag processing and presentation. In agreement with the in vivo data, DCs that were actively infected induced strong CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Although DCs that had phagocytosed dead parasites efficiently processed and presented parasite-derived OVA peptide to naive transgenic OT-II CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, they were unable to cross-present parasite-derived SIINFEKL peptide to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). A similar lack of response was observed when splenic-derived DCs were substituted for BMDCs (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>The inability of DCs to cross-present phagocytosed parasites led us to ask if dead tachyzoites could exert an inhibitory effect in trans that would block cross-presentation of Ag derived from live parasites. DCs were incubated with a mixture of TgOVAirr and HK <italic>T. gondii</italic> (TgHK), or TgOVAHK and irr <italic>T. gondii</italic> (Tgirr) tachyzoites. Although the majority of the infected DCs also contained phagocytosed parasites (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1</ext-link>), proliferation of naive OT-I cells was observed only with DCs in which OVA was expressed by irr tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>), thus indicating that phagocytosis of dead parasites does not inhibit cross-presentation of vacuole-derived Ag, nor does active infection promote presentation of Ag derived from tachyzoites within phagosomes. In parallel experiments, uptake of dead <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites failed to inhibit cross-presentation of Ag from phagosomes containing OVA-coated latex beads (ova-LB; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref> and Fig. S4 B), confirming that phagocytosed tachyzoites do not have a generalized suppressive effect on MHC class I presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Blocking parasite invasion inhibits cross-presentation</title><p>Because dead parasites were not cross-presented to OT-I T cells, we next asked if phagocytosis of live tachyzoites can lead to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming. Live TgOVA parasites were pretreated with 4-p-bromophenacyl bromide (4-p-BPB), an irreversible inhibitor of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> that completely blocks the host cell invasion process without metabolically disabling the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). 4-p-BPB suppressed parasite invasion in a dose-dependent fashion and, in a quantitatively similar manner, inhibited cross-presentation to OT-I T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Nevertheless, 4-p-BPB&#x02013;treated parasites were clearly phagocytosed and targeted to LAMP1<sup>+</sup> compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref> and not depicted) and, as expected, efficiently presented to CD4<sup>+</sup> OT-II cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). As a control, it was shown that 4-p-BPB&#x02013;treated tachyzoites secreted similar amounts of OVA as their untreated counterparts (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, phagocytosis fails to lead to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming even after uptake of live parasites. Similarly, treatment with cytochalasin D (CytD), which blocks tachyzoite invasion without inhibiting discharge of the rhoptry secretory organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), also prevented Ag cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>). The latter observation argues against a role for direct injection of parasite-derived Ag into the cytosolic MHC class I presentation pathway.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Blocking different steps of the invasion process inhibits cross-presentation.</bold> (A&#x02013;D) TgOVA parasites were pretreated with 4-p-BPB or the DMSO vehicle alone and were incubated with DCs.

(E and F) DCs were incubated with Tg or TgOVA parasites in the presence or absence of CytD for 30 min, washed, and incubated for an additional 3.5 h before fixation. Microscopic examination revealed that CytD treatment completely inhibited cell invasion (not depicted). In another set of samples, CytD-pretreated or untreated DCs were incubated with 1 mg/ml of soluble OVA for the same time period and fixed. OT-I T cells were then added to the DC cultures, and IFN-&#x003b3; production (E) and thymidine incorporation (F) were measured at 48 and 72 h, respectively.

In other systems, uptake of Ag through Fc&#x003b3;R ligation is known to promote cross-presentation by DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). However, targeting of either live (4-p-BPB&#x02013;treated) or dead parasites to Fc&#x003b3;R by means of antibody opsonization failed to result in MHC class I cross-presentation while efficiently priming MHC class II&#x02013;dependent OT-II T cell proliferation (Fig. S5). Again, this was shown not to be caused by an effect of opsonization on OVA secretion by the parasites (Fig. S5).</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence for fusion between hER and PV during active infection of DCs</title><p>Recruitment of ER components into Ag containing endo-/phagocytic organelles has been proposed as a mechanism to explain cross-presentation in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Live <italic>T. gondii</italic> is known to recruit hER in proximity to PV as a potential source of lipids in fibroblasts and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), although direct fusion between hER and PVM has never been documented. Immunofluorescence microscopy performed on actively infected DCs revealed that a luminal ER marker (KDEL-modified proteins) exhibited a circumferential staining pattern colocalizing with the PVM protein GRA7, indicating that these two compartments are in close apposition, which would allow for possible fusion events. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). A similar staining pattern was observed when antibodies against the ER markers Sec61 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>), calnexin, and calreticulin were used (not depicted). The occurrence of fusion events was directly demonstrated by immunogold labeling, which showed that gold particles detecting KDEL proteins localized to the PV lumen, between the parasite plasma membrane (PM) and the PVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). In contrast, no delivery of hER contents to the phagosomal lumen was detected in phagosomes after ingestion of opsonized live or dead parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, PVM fusion with host lysosomes was not observed in infected cells, whereas lysosomal fusion was clearly evident in <italic>T. gondii</italic>&#x02013;containing phagosomes (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).

Exotoxin A (ExoA) from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> has previously been shown to block the ERAD translocon subunit sec61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). ExoA treatment was found to markedly inhibit activation of naive OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by TgOVA-infected DCs while not affecting the presentation of exogenously added peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). Importantly, ExoA treatment had no effect on the presentation of endogenously generated SIINFEKL when DCs were infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing OVA (rVV-OVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>). ExoA treatment of parasite-infected DCs also resulted in decreased expression of cell-surface MHC class I (K<sup>b</sup>)&#x02013;SIINFEKL complexes, as detected by staining with the 25.D1.16 specific antibody, thus confirming that the observed effects on T cell activation are caused by a lack of OVA cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>). In contrast, ExoA treatment had no effect on surface expression of MHC class I in parasite-infected DCs or MHC class I&#x02013;peptide complexes in rVV-OVA&#x02013;infected or peptide-pulsed DCs (Fig. S7, A&#x02013;C, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082108/DC1</ext-link>).

Of particular note is the striking dependence, both in vitro and in vivo, of MHC class I presentation on active <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection and the inability of DCs to cross-present phagocytosed live or dead parasites or infected cells. Our findings indicate that the PV, in contrast to the phagosome, facilitates entry of <italic>T. gondii</italic> Ag into the class I pathway and further argue that the ability of parasite-containing PV to recruit and physically interact with hER is intimately associated with the process of cross-presentation.</p><p>In addition to its involvement here, retrotranslocation has also been implicated as an important step in the cross-presentation of both soluble and particulate-bound Ag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). In the latter situation, ER-phagosome fusion has been proposed in several studies as a mechanism by which exogenous Ag exits from the phagosomal vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), although the physiological relevance of these findings has been contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). It is of particular interest, then, that in the case of <italic>T. gondii</italic>&#x02013;infected DCs, parasite-containing phagosomes fail to recruit or fuse with the ER, nor do they permit the transit of Ag into the cytosolic MHC class I pathway. Instead, active remodeling of the PV by the parasite is required for both processes, arguing that for intracellular pathogens, cross-presentation requires more than simple delivery of live or dead organisms into a phagosome. The ability of phagosomes to cross-present Ag derived from protein-coated beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), although seemingly contradictory, may simply reflect the distinct nature of the phagosomal cargo and perhaps the levels of Ag available for presentation.</p><p>In this paper, we argue, based on the observation of molecular exchange between hER and PV, that direct fusion of these two compartments is a major route of Ag export into the cytosol. Because no defined channels or breaches could be detected at the points of hER&#x02013;PV membrane contact, it is likely that if such structures exist they are spatially restricted or highly transient. Alternatively, it is possible that exchange between the two compartments is mediated by &#x0201c;kiss-and-run&#x0201d;&#x02013;like events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>) that would allow for transfer of contents between hER and PV with very little or no exchange of membrane constituents, or perhaps by specialized fine membrane extensions analogous to the mitochondria-associated membranes that facilitate communication between ER and mitochondria in mammalian cells and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). In this regard, we and others have noted vesicle-like structures emanating from the PV that could also serve as an exit route for Ag. Regardless of whether these structures are involved in Ag transport, they too must eventually fuse with hER to allow for the observed requirement for retrotranslocation. Given that both immunogold and immunofluorescence labeling clearly indicate hER membrane components and the PV membrane to be continuous, it appears that the interaction between these two compartments is stable rather than transient and that direct fusion is the more likely explanation for Ag transfer.</p><p>The observed requirement for retrotranslocation argues strongly against several alternative mechanisms that might explain cross-presentation in <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. As noted above, previous work has documented the presence of pores in the PVM that allow the exchange of small molecules between the PV and cytosol. Nevertheless, if direct loading of MHC class I with peptides introduced into the cytoplasm by this route was the major mechanism by which <italic>T. gondii</italic> Ag access the class I pathway, then no requirement for retrotranslocation as well as proteasomal degradation would be expected. Similarly, it has been shown that during the invasion process parasite proteins are injected directly into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), thereby providing yet another possible route for entry of <italic>T. gondii</italic> Ag into the class I pathway. However, our finding that Ag cross-presentation is inhibited by CytD argues against such a mechanism, which again also would not necessarily require retrotranslocation. Although recent studies have described autophagy in association with PV disruption and parasite degradation in activated <italic>T. gondii</italic>&#x02013;infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>), we have not observed this process in infected DCs, nor is cross-presentation blocked by treatment of the cells with drugs that inhibit autophagy (unpublished data). Therefore, although autophagy may play an important role in parasite clearance, it seems unlikely that the process contributes significantly to cross-presentation of parasite-derived Ag by <italic>T. gondii</italic>&#x02013;infected DCs.</p><p>In summary, we propose that in the situation of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, active infection associated with PV formation results in the establishment of PVM&#x02013;hER junctions. Ag secreted into the PV gain access to the hER through these junctions, and then retrotranslocate through the ERAD system to enter the cytosol for processing and loading onto MHC class I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Recent findings demonstrating a role for the ER aminopeptidase associated with Ag processing in the final trimming of a <italic>T. gondii</italic> GRA6&#x02013;derived epitope are consistent with such a pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Although our evidence supports a major role for hER&#x02013;PV fusion in cross-presentation of <italic>T. gondii</italic>&#x02013;derived Ag by infected DCs, formal proof of this hypothesis would require selective blockade of hER recruitment to the PV. Unfortunately, there are as yet no inhibitors available that specifically target this process. In addition, it will be important to confirm these findings using the model Ag OVA with studies using naturally occurring parasite epitopes. Several endogenous parasite CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes that were described after the completion of this project are possible candidates for such an analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed mechanism for cross-presentation of <italic>T. gondii</italic>&#x02013;derived Ag.</bold> (left) Shown are events occurring after active invasion of DCs by live tachyzoites.

It is tempting to speculate that <italic>T. gondii</italic> exploits the same intracellular pathway to present Ag for the induction of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses that are critical for promoting pathogen latency and interhost transmission, and thus, for its success as a vertebrate parasite.
