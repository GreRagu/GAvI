As the official organ of the International CCN Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ccnsociety.com">http://ccnsociety.com</ext-link>), JCCS was launched a little more than a year ago to disseminate research achievements in the emerging fields of CCN proteins and intercellular communication. Our journal targets a wide readership composed of both researchers who already work in the fields of communication and others who wish to get acquainted with modern approaches of molecular and cellular biology.</p><p>The matricellular CCN proteins constitute a new family of proteins with features of signaling regulators (for a recent review see Holbourn et al. TIBS Oct 2008). Since these proteins interact with a handful of ligands, receptors and regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation, it became obvious that their functions are closely related to those of several other families of key regulatory proteins. Hence our desire to expand the scope of JCCS and open our readership to all colleagues interested in intracellular and/or extracellular signaling.</p><p>JCCS is not just another journal&#x02014;it aims to foster interactions between researchers and students of various backgrounds, providing the research community with original research, topical reviews written, as well as commentaries and opinions on recent topics.</p><p>We kindly invite you to consider JCCS as a media for publication of your research and participate in promoting JCCS as an important platform for disseminating new results in the fields of cell signaling.</p><p>Professor Bernard Perbal</p><p>Editor in Chief of JCCS</p><p>President ICCNS</p></body><back><ack><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack></back></article>
