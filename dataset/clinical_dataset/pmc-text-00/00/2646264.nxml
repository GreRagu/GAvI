Sumoylation has been indicated to regulate the stability of protein function, nuclear cytoplasm protein transport and gene transcription. Three members of the SUMO family have been described in vertebrates, SUMO-1, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>. In invertebrates, such as yeast, insects and nematodes, only a single <italic>SUMO </italic>gene termed <italic>SMT3</italic> is expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, whereas in plants up to eight version of SUMO are expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>.</p><p>SUMO-1 has been reported with various synonyms, such as GMP1, PIC1, sentrin, UBL1 or SMT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. The first mammalian protein shown to be sumoylated was RanGAP1, a GTPase-activating protein, which is known to play an important role in transport of proteins across the nuclear pore complex. Sumoylation facilitates the binding of RanGAP1 to nuclear pore, and changes its intracellular localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>. SUMO-1 modifications of heat shock transcription factors (HSF1 and HSF2) increase their DNA binding activities while blocking the modifications by mutation decreases HSF1 transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>. Similarly, SUMO-1 modified p53 tumor suppressor by increasing its transcriptional and apoptotic response. The sumoylation sites in p53 are located in the carboxy-terminal region, which is known to regulate its DNA binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>. Another transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT), can be sumoylated on the residues K684 and K897 when treated with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. In addition, several other transcription factors were reported to undergo SUMO modifications, including Ets transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, androgent receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, c-Myb<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, AP-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref> and c-Jun (Muller et al., 2000).

One of the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling proteins, namely Smad4, was identified as a target protein for SUMO-1 at two evolutionarily conserved lysine residues (Lys-113 and Lys-159) in the MH1 domain. Sumoylation of Smad4 by over-expression of SUMO-1 enhanced transcriptional responses and cellular responses induced by TGF-&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>. Another TGF-&#x003b2; signal protein, SnoN, is also regulated by sumoylation. Loss of sumoylation in the Lys-50 site (via a Lys-to-Arg point mutation) in SnoN potently activates muscle-specific gene expression and enhances myotube formation. These results suggests that SUMO modification plays an important role in regulation of myogenic differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>.</p><p>Sumoylation in invertebrate was mainly reported in <italic>Drosophila. </italic>Transcriptional repressor Tramtrack69 protein (Ttk69), which inhibits neuronal differentiation, was identified as one of the most important substrates for SUMO conjugation. SUMO and Ttk69 proteins localize together on polytene chromosome. SUMO-conjugated Ttk69 proteins are present at the sites of Ttk69 action <italic>in vivo </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>.

Phage lift hybridization method was used for screening TGF-&#x003b2; family and other related proteins by a mixture of six biotin-labeled degenerated oligonucleotide DNA probes. A total of 112 positive clones were isolated and sequenced. One of the cDNA sequences (664 nucleotides) showed a high homology to SUMO-1, named as <italic>LvSUMO-1. </italic>The cDNA sequence contains a protein-coding sequence of 282 nucleotides and 5' (37 nucleotides) and 3' (347 nucleotides) untranslated regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

All SUMO proteins from yeast to human share the conserved the C-terminal diglycine cleavage/attachment, which is the critical domain for SUMO protein maturation and conjugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>. The results from sequence alignment also revealed that SUMO-1 is highly evolutionarily conserved from human SUMO-1 to yeast Smt3 proteins, particularly the double glycine site. A prominent difference between the SUMO proteins and ubiquitin is the presence of a highly variable N-terminal extension in SUMO proteins, wherein it includes several charged amino acids such as glycines and prolines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>. The function of this N-terminal extension in SUMOs is not presently known. The homology of LvSUMO-1 and SMT3 of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is only 45% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Protein alignment of human SUMO1/2/3, mouse SUMO1/2/3, SMT3 Drosophila and LvSUMO-1 suggests that LvSUMO-1 has a high homology to human and mouse SUMO-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

The antibody to SUMO-1 is generated from rabbits immunized with a KLH conjugated synthetic peptide selected from the C-terminal region of human SUMO1. The cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins from different tissues were extracted and tested for LvSUMO-1 protein. In the cytoplasmic protein fraction, LvSUMO-1 was detected at the position of 10 KD in hepatopancreas, heart and intestine tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>a). The expression of LvSUMO-1 protein in nuclear fraction was also detected in hepatopancreas, intestine and lymphoid (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>b). In both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, LvSUMO-1 protein showed a high level of expression in hepatopancreas. The protein blot by this antibody also showed LvSUMO-1 conjugated protein bands since their molecular weight are more 10 KD. The free form of LvSUMO-1 protein was not detected in the abdominal muscle tissue while several conjugated protein signals with higher molecular weights were detected in the tissue (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>Most of the SUMO-1 protein was previously shown to localized on nuclear membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>. Unlike SUMO-2/3 that has an apparent free form, human SUMO-1 has no free form to be detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>. The LvSUMO-1 protein was detected in free form in intestine and hepatopancreas of cytosolic fraction and in hepatopancrease and lymphoid of nuclear fraction, which are more like the human SUMO-2/3. Many of sumolylated proteins have been found. For example, SUMO-1 is believed to form an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl terminus of SUMO-1 and a lysine side chain(s) of the target protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>. All SUMO forms are initially processed as inactive precursors, then mature by a carboxy-terminal proteolytic cleavage event, which yields the mature modifiers with exposed carboxy-terminal glycine residues. These residues are required for the formation of and isopeptide bond between the carboxyl terminus of SUMO with an &#x003b5;-amino group of lysine residue of a target protein. The processing reaction is catalyzed by a group of cysteine proteases, termed ULPs (ubiquitin-like protein-processing enzyme) or SUMO-specific proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>. The mechanism of SUMO conjugation has been proposed by Ronald T. Hay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, which consists of three enzymes cascade involving a Ubl activating enzyme(E1), a Ubl conjugating enzyme(E2), and typically a Ubl protein ligase(E3). To initiate the SUMO modification reaction, activating enzyme catalyzes the formation of adenylated SUMO in which the C-terminal carboxyl group of SUMO is covalently linked to AMP. SUMO was transesterified to conjugating enzyme. The conjugating enzyme called Ubc9 can directly recognize substrate protein that contain the SUMO modification consensus motif, &#x003c8;KXE motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>. In the case of LvSUMO-1 conjugation, the polymeric SUMO chain may happen because it contains SUMO modification consensus motif. However several key enzymes such as ligase (E3) in the pathways has been reported in shrimp or crustacean yet.</p></sec><sec><title>LvSUMO-1 mRNA expression and shrimp muscle development</title><p>The <italic>LvSUMO-1</italic> was originally identified from shrimp muscle cDNA library. Its mRNA expression can be easily detected by RT-PCR although only sumoylated proteins were detected in the abdominal muscle tissue by Western blotting. Therefore, we performed RT-PCR to study the function of <italic>LvSUMO-1</italic> expression in shrimp muscle tissue instead of western blot analysis. The developmental and life cycle of <italic>L. vannamei</italic> can be classified to seven stages, including egg, nauplius, protozoea, mysis, postlarva and juvenile and adult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>. Muscle formation in dendrobranchiate shrimp was reported by Kiernan and Hertzler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>. In the dendrobranchiate malacostracan <italic>Sicyonia ingentis</italic>, F-actin staining was first detected in limb setae at 12 h. Staining of F-actin was detected in the trunk at 15 h and grew into naupliar limbs. Sarcomeres were detected at 19 h, identifying the structures as extrinsic limp muscles. The extrinsic limb muscles enlarged but retain their general pattern during the later nauplius stages. Longitudinal trunk muscle and circumferential visceral muscle developed in the post-naupliar region during nauplius instars 4 and 5, at the time when the gut also formed. Among decapod malacostracan larvae, abdominal muscle development was described in zuea and mysis larvae of the caridean shrimp <italic>Crangon vulgaris </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>. And the adult muscle of dendrobranchiate shrimp <italic>Penaeus</italic> (<italic>Litopenaeus</italic>) <italic>setiferus</italic> have been carefully examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we sampled shrimp tissue over several developmental stages, mainly nauplius as the larva stage, postlarva and juvenile to study LvSUMO-1 expression. The <italic>LvSUMO-1 </italic>mRNA expression was detected in a low level in nauplius (Nau) stage and then followed by increased up-regulation in postlarva(PL) stage 1, 10 and 19. The expression was also presented in juvenile (Jn) (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>LvSUMO-1</italic> was up-regulated during the muscle formation. Other studies have showed that sumoylation of SnoN by SUMO-1 plays a role in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, which is known to regulate myogenesis. The over-expression of c-Ski/SnoN induces skeletal muscle differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>. Loss of sumoylation activates muscle-specific gene expression and enhanced myotube formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>. Most regulatory genes related to shrimp muscle formation and development are not known. This study suggests possible target protein by LvSUMO-1 modification may play a role in the regulation of shrimp myogenic differentiation and muscle formation.</p><p>Growth in shrimps, like other crustacean, is intermittent, and muscle mass accumulation occurs through molting-shedding of exoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>. Muscle morphology and biochemical changes of <italic>L. vannamei</italic> during molting process have been studied by Yang and his research group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>. Muscle structural &#x003b1;-actin and cytoskeleton &#x003b2;-actin were increased during intermolt and premolt stage, suggesting high muscle growth during these stages. However, the mRNA encoding for ubiquitin and Hsp70 did not increase significantly in premolt stages. In this study, three molting stages, including postmolt, intermolt and premolt, were used for RNA extraction. The <italic>LvSUMO-1</italic> transcript was detected in the abdominal muscle tissue in all molting stages tested. The <italic>LvSUMO-1</italic> mRNA expression was high at premolt (C) stage, and low during postmolt stage (A) and intermolt stages (B) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The <italic>LvSUMO-1</italic> expression in intermolt stage is much lower than in postmolt stage. As the overall muscle protein synthesis is higher in intermolt than in postmolt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, the result may indicate that LvSUMO-1 play an important role in the regulation of muscle protein synthesis and degradation during the molt cycle. Further comparisons of LvSUMO-1 and ubiquitin during molting stage are needed to clarify their expression patterns in relation to protein accumulation during shrimp molt cycle.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p><italic>LvSUMO-1</italic> cDNA contains a protein-coding sequence of 282 nucleotides and 37 untranslated nucleotides at 5' and 347 untranslated nucleotides at 3' ends. The deduced 93 amino acids was found to exhibit 83% identity with the Western Honeybee SUMO-1 and 65% identity with human and mouse SUMO-1. The homology of LvSUMO-1 and of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> SUMO-1 (SMT3) is only 45%. LvSUMO-1 has a sumoylation motif that is conserved from mouse to human. This is the first report of SUMO-1 in crustacean species. The expression of <italic>LvSUMO-1</italic> mRNA was identified in most shrimp tissues. <italic>LvSUMO-1</italic> protein was found in both cytoplasm and nucleus while mostly detectable proteins were located in cytoplasm. By using SUMO-1 antibody detection, the free form of LvSUMO-1 protein was detected mostly in hepatopancreas, cytosolic and lymphoid. Several SUMO-1 conjugated proteins were detected in abdominal muscle tissue. <italic>LvSUMO-1</italic> level also showed a progressive increase over the early developmental stages. The expression patterns in abdominal muscle during the molt cycle indicate that <italic>LvSUMO-1</italic> may be involved in the regulation of muscle protein synthesis and degradation in shrimp.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the USDA-CSREES-TSTAR programs (Award #2008-34135-19343) and National Research Council of Thailand.
