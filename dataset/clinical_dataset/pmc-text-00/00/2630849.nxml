Introduction</title><p>Certain species of the marine diatom <italic>Pseudo-nitzschia</italic> produce the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA), which fish and shellfish can concentrate, putting consumers of these species such as marine mammals and humans at risk for adverse effects during and subsequent to harmful algal bloom (HAB) or &#x02018;red tide&#x02019; events. Over the last several decades, the frequency and global distribution of HAB incidents appear to have increased and may be related to human activity, such as increased pollution runoff into aquatic ecosystems or global warming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-md-06-00636">1</xref>]. HAB toxins, including brevetoxin, microcystin, and saxitoxin, are immunotoxic in humans, mice, and aquatic mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-md-06-00636">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-md-06-00636">5</xref>]. DA is immunotoxic in oysters and mussels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-md-06-00636">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-md-06-00636">7</xref>]. However, the potential immunotoxicity of DA in mammals has not been investigated. As human and wildlife exposure to DA is expected to continue, a better understanding of the sub-lethal effects of DA, as well as other HAB toxins, is warranted.</p><p>In humans, DA is the causative agent of amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, seizures and permanent loss of short term memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-md-06-00636">8</xref>]. In 1987, over 100 people became ill and 4 people died after eating DA-contaminated mussels originating from Prince Edward Island [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-md-06-00636">9</xref>]. Since 1998, hundreds of California sea lion deaths were linked to exposure to DA, resulting from the trophic transfer of DA from diatoms to prey such as northern anchovy during DA HAB events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-md-06-00636">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-md-06-00636">12</xref>]. The rate of re-stranding following treatment for DA exposure was approximately 20 times higher than for animals stranded for other reasons, suggesting chronic changes may have affected their survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-md-06-00636">12</xref>]. Sub-clinical DA-induced immunomodulation may have predisposed those animals to such chronic manifestations.</p><p>DA is a rigid analog of the neurotransmitter glutamate and a potent agonist of kainate and alpha amino-5-methyl-3-hydroxyisoxazolone-4-propionate (AMPA) subtypes of the glutamate receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-md-06-00636">13</xref>]. Persistent activation of these receptor subtypes results in rapid excitotoxicity, with the secondary activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors and voltage dependent calcium channels, which leads to calcium dependent cell death and neuronal lesions in areas of the brain where glutamatergic pathways are heavily concentrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-md-06-00636">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-md-06-00636">15</xref>].</p><p>Recent evidence emerged that glutamatergic pathways also exist in non-neuronal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-md-06-00636">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-md-06-00636">20</xref>]. For immune cells, NMDA receptors were identified in rat macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-md-06-00636">21</xref>], while both NMDA and kainate/AMPA subtypes were detected in human and rodent lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-md-06-00636">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-md-06-00636">25</xref>] and were suggested to play a role in cell signaling and functional events, such as cell division.</p><p>The weight of evidence suggest that DA may be immunotoxic in mammals, as (1) DA was shown to be immunotoxic in bivalves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-md-06-00636">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-md-06-00636">7</xref>], (2) glutamate receptors (similar to receptors implicated in mediating neurotoxic effects) were demonstrated on mouse and human immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-md-06-00636">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-md-06-00636">25</xref>], and (3) exposure to glutamate modulated human mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-md-06-00636">24</xref>]. The hypothesis for the present study is that DA is immunotoxic in a mammalian species following both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure as measured by changes in immune cell functions. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies were performed to determine the direct effects, i.e. without the potential influence of administration, distribution, metabolism or excretion (ADME), of DA on immune cells and their functions by co-incubating isolated immune cells with DA. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies were performed to determine the potential indirect effects of DA on immune cells and their functions, i.e. with the potential influence of ADME and/or complex system interactions, for example, between the nervous and immune systems.</p><p>Assays to measure immunotoxicity included peripheral blood leukocyte phagocytosis and mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte (splenocyte) proliferation upon DA exposure. Both functional immune assays were validated by and are part of the National Toxicology Program to predict the immunotoxicity of chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-md-06-00636">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-md-06-00636">27</xref>]. Phagocytosis is a key innate immune function performed predominately by peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes, providing the first line of defense against invading organisms, particularly bacteria. Lymphocyte proliferation is a key adaptive immune response in which lymphocytes proliferate upon stimulation by an antigen or mitogen and represents the first step towards the production of effector and memory B and T lymphocytes.</p><p>DA has not been reported to bind directly to immune cells, however, as DA is an analog of glutamate, it is possible that it binds to immune cell glutamate receptor(s) in order to mediate immune functions. Modulation of cytosolic calcium is a mechanism involved in DA-induced neurotoxicity and involves cell membrane ionotropic glutamate receptors, such as AMPA and kainate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-md-06-00636">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-md-06-00636">20</xref>]. In an initial attempt to identify the most likely cell surface glutamate receptor(s) by which DA modulates immune functions, qualitative changes in cytosolic calcium mobilization induced by several ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists were compared to that of DA. This study provides the foundation to determine the immunotoxicity of DA (the hazard identification step in risk assessment) and elucidate the mechanisms and pathways involved in the response to toxic levels of DA in mammals, which may be relevant to marine mammals and humans with documented DA exposure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>2.

However, the magnitude of the change induced by those agonists was consistently less than that induced by DA for neutrophils and lymphocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>3. Discussion and Conclusion</title><p>To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the immunotoxic effects of DA in any mammalian species. Previous reports demonstrated that DA was not immunotoxic either upon i<italic>n vitro</italic> exposure of isolated human dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-md-06-00636">28</xref>] or rats exposed <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-md-06-00636">29</xref>], although different cell types and route of exposure were employed. When exposed to physiologically relevant concentrations of DA, different responses were observed between <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure. This may reflect differences in exposure times, ADME (especially excretion, see below) and the potential for both direct and indirect effects of DA on immune cells following <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure.</p><sec><title>3.1 In vivo exposure</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic> exposure to DA modulated both innate and adaptive immune cell functions and effects appeared to be cell type- and time-specific. In general, it appeared that <italic>in vivo</italic> DA exposure acutely enhanced innate immune function (monocyte phagocytosis) by 12 hr, followed by immune suppression of both innate (neutrophil phagocytosis) and adaptive (T lymphocyte proliferation) immune functions by 24 hr, and with return to control levels 48 hr after exposure. This time course correlates well with the clearance of DA from mouse blood, with almost 99% clearance by 24 hr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-md-06-00636">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-md-06-00636">31</xref>].</p><p>In a similar study following <italic>in vivo</italic> DA exposure, gene expression in mouse peripheral blood leukocytes was assayed (Ryan, J., personal communication). Several chemokines were found to be differentially expressed, including the down regulation of Ccl5/Rantes, which was also shown to be down regulated in monocytes exposed to glucocorticoids <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-md-06-00636">32</xref>]. In addition, DA exposure <italic>in vivo</italic> also produced an up regulation in integrin alpha 4, which was shown to be important in recruitment of mononuclear cells to sites of inflammation but also necessary for immune cells to permeate the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-md-06-00636">33</xref>]. Interestingly, isolated rat astrocytes exposed to 10 &#x003bc;M DA showed up regulation of chemokine genes for IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-md-06-00636">34</xref>]. The relationships between changes in immune cell gene expression and immune functions, which may be related to or independent of glucocorticoid and glutamate receptors, warrant future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>3.2 In vitro exposure</title><p><italic>In vitro</italic> exposure to DA directly modulated innate and adaptive immune cell functions, although the effects were different (direction of change and affected cell types) from <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure. Neutrophil (1 and 2 or more beads) and monocyte (1 or more beads) phagocytosis were significantly reduced only at the lowest concentration tested. It is possible that the most active phagocytic cells (3+) may not have been the preferential targets of DA. Lymphocyte proliferation, including spontaneous as well as T and B cell induced, was increased at low concentrations and decreased at high concentrations (further discussed below). Hormetic immune responses are not unusual following exposure to various endogenous and exogenous chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-md-06-00636">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-md-06-00636">36</xref>]. T cell proliferation was significantly modulated by DA using only the sub-optimal concentration of ConA. In this case, lymphocytes that were proliferating at a slower rate proved to be more sensitive to the immunotoxic effects of DA than lymphocytes proliferation at a higher rate. Importantly, this effect would have been missed if only using the optimal ConA mitogen concentration. This highlights the need to test both suboptimal and optimal concentrations of mitogens when assessing the immunotoxicity of chemicals on lymphocyte proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-md-06-00636">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>3.3 Potential mechanism(s)/pathways(s) mediating in vitro DA-induced immunotoxicty</title><p>Experiments were initiated to determine the mechanisms and pathways by which DA may exert its immunotoxic effects. Experiments were performed with limited numbers of mice (n=3) to assess qualitative trends in modulation of cytosolic calcium by DA, a well described effect documented in various neural and non-neural cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-md-06-00636">15</xref>], to determine whether the presence of glutamate receptors (and their different sub-types) on immune cells may be involved in DA-induced immunotoxicity.</p><p>DA exposure resulted in qualitative reductions and increases in cytosolic calcium compared to unexposed control in all three leukocyte subtypes tested in the present study. Numerous reports have documented increases in cytosolic calcium in different cell types (see review by Pulido, 2008). Similarly, cytosolic calcium slightly increased in all cell types upon exposure to 100 &#x003bc;M DA, with the greatest increase in monocytes. However, upon exposure to 1 &#x003bc;M (for all cell types) and 10 &#x003bc;M (for neutrophils and lymphocytes), cytosolic calcium was decreased. In this case, DA may have induced calcium sequestration into the endoplasmic recticulum and/or mitochondria, a response documented by glutamate receptor agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-md-06-00636">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-md-06-00636">40</xref>].</p><p>For all three immune cell subtypes, changes in cytosolic calcium were compared to changes in immune functions (upon <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure) in an initial attempt to explain DA-induced immunotoxicity. For neutrophils and monocytes, phagocytosis was significantly reduced only at 1 &#x003bc;M DA, the same concentration that also reduced cytosolic calcium in both cell types. As calcium mobilization is necessary for phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-md-06-00636">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-md-06-00636">42</xref>], the lack of free cytosolic calcium may help explain the reduction in phagocytosis. Although calcium was reduced by 10 &#x003bc;M in both cell types, no significant changes in phagocytosis were observed, an observation not easily explained at this time. At 100 &#x003bc;M, no significant changes in phagocytosis were observed and corresponded with modest to moderate increases in calcium in neutrophils and monocytes, respectively, suggesting that these increases in calcium were not involved in modulating phagocytosis.</p><p>Limited data exists for glutamate receptors on differentiated monocytes. U937 cells (human histiocytic lymphoma derived) demonstrated differential growth and morphology upon exposure to glutamate receptor agonists depending on external glutamate concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-md-06-00636">25</xref>]. In primary rat microglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-md-06-00636">43</xref>], kainate induced rapid redistribution of the actin cytoskeleton, a necessary step in the process of phagocytosis. NMDA receptors have been identified on rat macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-md-06-00636">21</xref>]. Our results also demonstrated a consistent reduction in cytosolic calcium upon stimulation with L-glutamate receptors in monocytes that was consistent with that for DA (at least 4 and 6 min. post-exposure), suggesting the presence and functionality of Glutamate-responsive receptors on mouse monocytes, and the possibility that they could be involved in mediating the toxicity of DA on those cells. Taken together, these data suggest that glutamate receptors exist on monocytes and may be involved in modulating phagocytosis. Nevertheless, the presence and potential role of glutamate receptors responsive to DA on neutrophils are unknown at this time, and none of the receptor subtypes matched the direction and magnitude of change in cytosolic calcium obtained with DA.</p><p>For both T and B lymphocyte, 100 &#x003bc;M DA significantly reduced lymphocyte proliferation, which corresponded with a very modest increase in calcium mobilization. Although increases in cytosolic calcium have been show to reduce lymphocyte proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-md-06-00636">44</xref>], it is not possible to conclude that this was the case in this study. Interestingly, 1 and 10 &#x003bc;M DA significantly increased proliferation, which corresponded with reduced cytosolic calcium in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The role of reduced calcium in mediating proliferation appears unlikely. Alternatively, modulation of voltage-activated potassium channels by glutamate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-md-06-00636">45</xref>] may be one mechanism that explains both enhancement and suppression of T lymphocyte proliferation. Poulopoulou et al. (2005) demonstrated that low glutamate concentrations (below 100 &#x003bc;M) positively modulated potassium channel gating resulting in T lymphocytes that were readily responsive to stimuli with a maximal effect at 1 &#x003bc;M. In contrast, glutamate at concentrations &#x0003e;100 &#x003bc;M was shown to decrease potassium channel currents thereby inhibiting T lymphocyte responsiveness to stimuli. The previous study may help explain how the low and medium concentrations of DA enhanced lymphocyte proliferation while high concentrations of DA reduced proliferation in the current study. Although no report has demonstrated the effects of glutamate on B cells, they may share common mechanisms and pathways with T cells. Taken together, these data support that glutamate receptors may be involved in modulation of lymphocyte proliferation, but our studies have not identified a receptor sub-type that could match the magnitude of cytosolic calcium mobilization induced by DA.</p><p>Though studies have identified glutamate receptor subtypes on human and rodent immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-md-06-00636">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-md-06-00636">24</xref>], clearly, additional work must be performed to confirm that DA can exert its immunomodulatory effects through these receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>3.4 Differences between direct vs indirect effects</title><p>There are two possible explanations to account for differences in DA-induced immunotoxicity between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure. First, <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure was carried out at fixed concentrations for the entire incubation period, whereas following <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure, immune cells would not be exposed to prolonged high concentrations due to the rapid renal excretion of DA, which reduces the ultimate concentration of DA in blood to which immune cells are exposed. Therefore, the final concentration of DA &#x02018;seen&#x02019; by immune cells would differ between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> exposure.</p><p>Second, modulation of immune functions <italic>in vivo</italic> may be secondary to the direct effects of DA on other organ systems. There is clear evidence that the central nervous system modulates the peripheral immune system through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-md-06-00636">46</xref>]. It is possible that DA binding to glutamate receptors in the hippocampus, the well-described mechanism by which DA exerts its neurotoxic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-md-06-00636">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-md-06-00636">48</xref>], may activate the HPA axis, resulting in release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Microinjection of agonists to hippocampal glutamate receptors, including the AMPA subtype receptor which DA can bind, induced elevation of plasma ATCH in a dose-dependent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-md-06-00636">49</xref>]. ACTH, in turn, induces adrenal release of glucocorticoids, which modulate innate and adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-md-06-00636">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-md-06-00636">52</xref>]. Glucocorticoids exert their effects by binding to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor (GC), a ligand-dependent transcription factor, which regulates gene expression and functions in immune cells. For example, human monocytes exposed <italic>in vitro</italic> to glucocorticoids resulted in an induction of &#x0201c;phagocytic&#x0201d; genes and was associated with an approximate 2.5-fold increase in phagocytosis of fluorescent latex beads and complement opsonized <italic>Leishmania major</italic>, compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-md-06-00636">32</xref>]. In the present study, monocyte phagocytosis of fluorescent latex beads was enhanced at 12 hr. Glucocorticoids were shown to suppress neutrophil phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-md-06-00636">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-md-06-00636">53</xref>] and suppress lymphocyte proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-md-06-00636">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-md-06-00636">55</xref>], similar to the effects observed in the present study. Gene expression changes seen in the brain after DA exposure are consistent with an increase in glucocorticoid production with the up-regulation of serum and glucocorticoid kinase, and Gilz (glucocorticoid induced leucine zipper) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-md-06-00636">56</xref>]. Further in the same study, several immune relevant genes were differentially expressed in the brain such as cyclooxygenase 2, CSA-conditional T cell activation dependent protein, and alpha and beta subunits of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 2. In the current study, glucocorticoid levels were not measured, but should be explored in future experiments to help elucidate indirect mechanisms upon <italic>in vivo</italic> DA exposure.</p><p>Different glutamate receptor types/expression/activity between neutrophils, monocytes, and T lymphocytes could help explain why monocytes were acutely sensitive to the effects of DA, while the response by neutrophils and T lymphocyte was delayed. Interestingly, no effects were observed for B lymphocytes, suggesting differences in surface receptors and/or signaling pathways among immune cells.</p></sec><sec><title>3.5. Relevancy of immune modulation</title><p>Any modulation of immune functions, whether in increase or decrease, is of concern. Although the magnitudes of the changes in immune functions were sometimes small, these changes could have significant biological consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-md-06-00636">57</xref>]. Reduction of phagocytosis may lead to decreased pathogen clearance, allowing opportunistic pathogens to produce disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-md-06-00636">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-md-06-00636">59</xref>]. Enhancement of phagocytosis could lead to premature release of cytosolic lysosomal content and reactive oxygen species, resulting in local inflammation and tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-md-06-00636">60</xref>]. Non-specific and unregulated increases in lymphocyte proliferation may be the initiating step in the transformation of a lymphocyte into a cancer cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-md-06-00636">61</xref>]. Interestingly, glutamate receptors antagonists have been shown to be important in the suppression of some tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-md-06-00636">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63-md-06-00636">63</xref>], while DA has been show to increase chromosomal abnormalities in the Caco-2 cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-md-06-00636">64</xref>], suggesting a potential role of DA in tumor formation. In addition, non-specific stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation may potentially contribute to autoimmune diseases or anergy, an active state of unresponsiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-md-06-00636">61</xref>]. A reduction in lymphocyte proliferation may prevent the expansion of effector and memory T and B lymphocytes, thus increasing an individual&#x02019;s susceptibility to opportunistic infection or neoplasms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-md-06-00636">65</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>3.6 Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to demonstrate the immunomodulatory effects of both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure to DA in a mammalian species. In the risk assessment scheme, DA can be viewed as a hazard, requiring additional studies, including elucidating the mechanism(s) of action. The present study provides initial data to suggest that calcium mobilization and glutamate sub type cell surface receptors as potential mechanisms and pathways involved in the response to toxic levels of domoic acid in mammals. In addition, future gene expression profiles may help identify specific biomarkers in blood that may lead to a biomonitoring system for subacute exposure in humans and protected marine species whose populations are exposed annually to toxic algal blooms.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>4.

Adult, 25&#x02013;28 g ICR female mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were weighed and received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 2.5 &#x003bc;g/g DA (n=10 mice per exposure period) or vehicle control (PBS; n=10 mice per exposure period) with a U-100 Insulin syringe and a 28 gauge needle. This dose was chosen as it was previously shown in mice to be symptomatic but sub-lethal (Ryan, personal communication) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-md-06-00636">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-md-06-00636">56</xref>], as well as inducing changes in brain gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-md-06-00636">30</xref>]. Mice were observed for one hr after dosing for any clinical signs of acute DA toxicity. At the end of each exposure period (12, 24 or 48 hr), mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. Blood was immediately collected via cardiac puncture followed by cervical dislocation to ensure death, and spleen was removed and stored in ice cold DMEM until processing (below). The study design and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Connecticut.</p></sec><sec><title>4.2 Phagocytosis</title><p>From individual mouse whole blood samples, erythrocytes were lysed using NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and the leukocytes were re-suspended in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY). Cells were washed twice with HBSS, and their viability was assessed using the exclusion dye trypan blue. Leukocytes were adjusted to 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>/ml in HBSS and plated (100 &#x003bc;l per well) in a round bottom 96-well plate (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) in triplicate. One &#x003bc;m-diameter fluorescent latex beads (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were added to the cell suspension to obtain a ratio of approximately 100 beads/cell, and cells were incubated for one hr at 37&#x000b0;C, under agitation at 300 rpm using a Thermomixer R (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The cell suspension from each well was then layered on a cushion of ice cold 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and centrifuged at 150g for 8 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant containing the free beads was discarded and the cells were re-suspended in 200 &#x003bc;l of PBS containing 1% neutral buffered formalin (Decal Corp, Tallman, NY). Cells were stored at 4&#x000b0;C until analysis (within 24 hr). The fluorescence of approximately 10,000 cells was read with a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Rutherford, NJ) flow cytometer using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry System, San Jose, CA). Neutrophils and monocytes were gated electronically according to their relative size (forward scatter; FSC) and complexity (side scatter; SCC). The fluorescence of the cells was read at 530 nm (FL-1) on a logarithmic scale using the fluorescence of free beads as reference. Cells acquired a fluorescence equal to that of the number of beads they ingested. Phagocytosis was evaluated as the proportion of neutrophil and monocytes that had phagocytized one or more beads (1+, the proportion of all cells that participate in phagocytosis, includes 2+ and 3+), two or more beads (2+, includes 3+) and three or more beads (3+, the proportion of cells that are most efficient in phagocytosis), the endpoint of phagocytosis routinely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-md-06-00636">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68-md-06-00636">68</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>4.3.

Mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque plus (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala Sweden) for 35 min at 990 g. The mononuclear cells were re-suspended in complete DMEM, washed once, and enumerated with their viability assessed using the exclusion dye trypan blue. Lymphocytes in complete DMEM were plated (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml final concentration, 100 &#x003bc;l per well) in triplicate in 96 well flat bottom tissue culture plates (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for a total of 66 hr with the T cell mitogen concanavalin A (Con A Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or the B cell mitogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Con A was used at a sub-optimal concentration (0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml), as well as at an optimal concentration (1 &#x003bc;g/ml). LPS was used at a sub-optimal concentration (0.05 &#x003bc;g/ml), as well as at an optimal concentration (5 &#x003bc;g/ml). Suboptimal concentrations were used as they proved more sensitive in detecting immunotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-md-06-00636">37</xref>].

Cell fluorescence was recorded for 10 sec 1 min before (baseline fluorescence) and every 2 min (for 6 min) immediately following the addition of DA (time 0). Glutamate receptor agonists, kainate, AMPA, NMDA, and L-glutamate (all from Sigma, St. Louis, MO), were tested at 0 and 1&#x003bc;M, the same molar concentration shown to modulate phagocytosis upon <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure (see Results). It was reasoned that if the pattern of calcium mobilization for one or more of the selected agonists was similar to that produced by DA, it could be inferred that DA exerts its effects through that particular agonist receptor(s). Cell fluorescence was simultaneously recorded for all leukocytes. Neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes were then analyzed separately based on electron gates.
