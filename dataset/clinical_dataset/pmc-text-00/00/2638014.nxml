A lot of effort has been put into combating the parasite, and the result has been a large drop in the number of infected people over the last decades. The average infected person also now has few worms, and hence excretes few eggs in stool. This has made it increasingly difficult to get a correct diagnosis by the diagnostic tests traditionally used. Tests based on detecting eggs in stool can be false-negative and tests detecting antibodies can be false-positive due to persisting antibodies or antibodies from other worm infections. Hence there is a need for new diagnostic strategies. Formol-ethyl acetate sedimentation concentration is a technique for detecting eggs in stool by microscopy, but has not to our knowledge been evaluated for <italic>S. japonicum</italic>. We compared the technique, using a single stool sample and a commercial preparation kit, with three tests traditionally used in the endemic countries (Kato-Katz thick smear, hatching test and indirect hemagglutination antibody detection). The sedimentation technique detected disappointing few positives and seems not to be an advantage in the diagnosis of low-intensity <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infection, compared to the traditionally used tests.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="4"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schistosomiasis japonica is still a major public health problem, especially in China, despite great achievements during the past 50 years in controlling this parasitic disease. Diagnosis is a key for decision-making, both on individual and community levels. The current epidemiologic situation in the <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic>-endemic countries (China, the Philippines and Indonesia) has made the use of many common diagnostic assays problematic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Utzinger1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Low-intensity infections reduce the sensitivity of tests which demonstrate eggs in stool such as the Kato-Katz thick smear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Katz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and the hatching test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Ye1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, especially when only a single stool sample is available for examination. Antibody detection tests suffer from low specificity, often due to persistent antibodies from previously treated infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Feldmeier1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Zhou1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Stool concentration techniques, especially formol (formalin)-ether or formol-ethyl acetate sedimentation concentration is the preferred method for detection of helminth eggs and protozoa cysts in many clinical parasitology laboratories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Allen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Truant1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, although to a lesser extent in Africa and Asia. The formol-ethyl acetate sedimentation concentration technique (subsequently termed &#x02018;sedimentation technique&#x02019;) is one of the methods recommended in the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly NCCLS) guidelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Clinical1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and the Cumitech guidelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Garcia1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> for recovery of parasites from the intestinal tract. The sedimentation technique processes a relatively large stool sample and is thus theoretically more sensitive than alternative techniques in low-intensity helminth infections. To our knowledge there are no published data evaluating this method for the detection of <italic>S. japonicum</italic>. As the sedimentation technique is more resource-demanding than the Kato-Katz technique in terms of equipment and workload, the method should substantially improve the diagnostic yield in order to be cost-effective. The primary aim of this study was to assess whether the sedimentation technique could be a sensitive alternative to the tests traditionally used in the endemic areas, and hence potentially play a role in a diagnostic algorithm of the control programs. Additionally, as diagnosing light infections is a challenge in the individual patient too, information from this study might find interest in travel medicine (where the sedimentation technique is traditionally used) and at clinics in endemic areas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study area, population and ethical considerations</title><p>Stool samples and sera were collected in the villages Guanghui and Heping in Laozhou township, located on an island in the Yangtze River in Tongling county, Anhui province, China.

However, 38 samples were discarded because of inadequate sample size or missing results thus leaving 106 samples for further analysis. This study population of 106 persons consisted of 56&#x00025; males and 44&#x00025; females aged 7&#x02013;76 years (mean 39 years). The number of positive persons for each test was 47 (44&#x00025;) for IHA, 19 (18&#x00025;) for Kato-Katz thick smear, 27 (26&#x00025;) for hatching test and 10 (9&#x00025;) for the sedimentation test. A person was considered positive by the &#x0201c;reference standard&#x0201d; if IHA was positive together with Kato-Katz positive and/or hatching test positive.

Eight persons were positive in both tests.

Several authors have compared sedimentation techniques and Kato-Katz in the diagnosis of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> with divergent conclusions as to which has the highest sensitivity. The two largest comparative studies conclude that the sensitivity of 2 or 3 Kato-Katz slides from a single stool is superior to the sedimentation technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Brown1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Ebrahim1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

They are often surrounded by stool material. Hence a particularly watchful eye is needed to detect low-intensity infections.</p><p>The sedimentation technique had a low sensitivity in this study. Even if we used a positive Kato-Katz or a positive hatching test as the only positive reference standard criterion, regardless of IHA, the test properties of the sedimentation technique remained almost the same with a sensitivity of 23.7&#x00025; and specificity 98.8&#x00025;. There may be several explanations for the low sensitivity. When the egg output is very low, it will be a matter of chance whether there is an egg on the slide or not. This may also explain why only few in the reference standard group were positive for both Kato-Katz and hatching. Knight <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Knight1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and Ebrahim <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Ebrahim1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> both calculated that half of all <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs were lost in the sedimentation technique procedure compared to Kato-Katz. Examination of more than one sedimentation technique slide from each sample would most likely increase the sensitivity, but also be very time-consuming compared to Kato-Katz. We used approximately 15 min to examine each sedimentation technique slide, while an experienced technician uses approximately 3 min on each Kato-Katz slide. It has been shown that the number of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> eggs may vary between consecutive stool samples from the same person, favouring examination of repeated samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Yu2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Collecting repeated stool samples in large control programs is often not feasible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Lin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-AlarcondeNoya1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in handling individual patients, such as in travel medicine and in clinics in endemic areas, examining repeated stool samples is easier to accomplish, and are indeed often recommended. In the present study we examined a single stool sample, and hence could not determine the value, especially in terms of sensitivity, of repeated sampling. The sedimentation technique gives the opportunity to examine for intestinal protozoa as well. Hookworm eggs clear rapidly in the Kato-Katz procedure and will usually not be visible unless the smears are examined soon after preparation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-World1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Ramsan1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Booth1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

The ability to detect a broad range of intestinal parasites is usually important when taking care of individual patients, while both intestinal protozoa and hookworm are in most cases of secondary interest in <italic>S. japonicum</italic> control programs. The sedimentation technique had high specificity in this study, and even the two &#x0201c;false positive&#x0201d; sedimentation technique samples might possibly be the result of a false negative reference standard when interpreted in light of the aforementioned low sensitivity of Kato-Katz and hatching tests, especially when only a single stool sample is examined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Yu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Zhou1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Yu2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000386-Lin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We found the Parasep Midi Faecal Parasite Concentrator kit to be very practical for field sampling and preparation with limited hands-on time required.
