However, there is a lackof consensus regarding the treatment most appropriate for CI. The aim of the study was to investigate thetreatment for CI by surveying the ophthalmologists regarding the most common treatment modalities usedin India.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Four hundred questionnaires were distributed amongst ophthalmologists attendingdifferent sessions of the Delhi Ophthalmological Society annual conference held in April 2007. Two hundredand three ophthalmologists responded (response rate 50.75%). The responders included 109 privatepractitioners, 57 consultants attached to teaching institutes and 37 residents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of ophthalmologists (66.7%) claimed encountering &#x0003e;5% outpatient departmentpatients with CI. Pencil push-ups therapy (PPT) was the most common first line of treatment offeredby ophthalmologists (79%) followed by synoptophore exercises (18%). Only 3% referred the patients tooptometrists. Thirty per cent ophthalmologists claimed good results with PPT, which was significantly higherin private practitioners (35%). Only 26% ophthalmologists explained physiological diplopia to patients ona regular basis and reported significantly higher percentage of patients (46.3%) with good results. Only12.3% ophthalmologists needed to refer &#x0003e;30% patients for synoptophore exercises. For failure of PPT 86.7%considered lack of compliance as the major reason as perceived by ophthalmologists.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This survey suggested that most ophthalmic practitioners prescribed PPT as the initial treatmentfor CI and had satisfactory results with PPT. The majority of the practitioners did not explain to the patientabout physiological diplopia. Explaining physiological diplopia may improve outcome, as perceived fromthe survey.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Convergence insufficiency</kwd><kwd>near point of convergence</kwd><kwd>orthoptic exercises</kwd><kwd>vision therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Convergence insufficiency (CI) is a common problem(2 to 8%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Different modalities of exercisessuch as home exercises, pencil push-ups therapy (PPT), use of prismsand lenses, jump vergence are used for treatment.

The results suggest thatthe most common treatment prescribed by optometrists wasPPT (36%) followed by home-based vision therapy (22%) andoffice-based vision therapy (16%). For the ophthalmologists, themost common treatment prescribed was PPT (50%) followed byhome-based vision therapy (21%) and base-in prism (10%).</p><p>There is no such survey of Indian ophthalmologists to ourknowledge.

The majority of theophthalmologists belonged to Delhi and the northern states ofIndia. Four hundred questionnaires [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] were distributedamongst ophthalmologists attending different sessions and203 ophthalmologists responded (response rate 50.75%). Theresponders included 109 private practitioners, 57 consultantsattached to teaching institutes and 37 residents. Total numberof members of the Delhi Ophthalmological Society is 4000. Fourhundred constitute 10% and 203 respondents constitute 5.07%of the total members.</p><p>The data was analyzed using SPSS 11.5 for Windows.Descriptive statistics was derived and chi-square test was used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thirty four per cent ophthalmologists claimed &#x0003e;10% patients inthe outpatient department (OPD) with CI requiring treatment,while 22.7% ophthalmologists suggested that they attend to6-10% OPD patients with CI [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Patients of CI presentedto ophthalmologists with major symptoms of eye strain(75.3%) and headache (71.4%). Diplopia, blurring of vision,near reading problem, confusion between lines accounted for10.3% of complaints according to the ophthalmologists [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>].For diagnosis all the ophthalmologists used symptoms ascriteria. Of the ophthalmologists, 42.4% measured near pointof convergence (NPC) as well as fusion range (FR) along withsymptoms, while 9.9% used FR and 39.9% measured NPC fordiagnosis in addition to symptoms. Only 7.9% relied merelyon symptoms to diagnose CI.</p><p>Pencil push-ups therapy was the most common first lineof treatment (78.8%). While 17.7% ophthalmologists reliedon synoptophore exercises as the first line of treatment, only3.4% ophthalmologists referred patients to the optometristfor prescribing treatment [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Of the ophthalmologists23.2% had no access to synoptophore. Amongst others, 12.3%ophthalmologists referred &#x0003e;30% patients for synoptophoreexercises and the rest (64.5%) referred less than 30% patientsfor synoptophore exercises.</p><p>Thirty per cent ophthalmologists reported good resultsin patients treated with PPT. Fifty-one per cent experiencedfair results and only 19% suggested poor results. Privatepractitioners claimed significantly better success rate (34.9%having good or excellent results) than consultants and residents(<italic>P</italic> = 0.016). Duration of exercises given was 5 min per day by33.5%, 10 min per day by 33% and 15 min or more by 33.5%ophthalmologists. The majority of the ophthalmologists (81.3%)gave exercises for &#x02265; four weeks.</p><p>Physiological diplopia was explained to every patient byonly 26.6% ophthalmologists. While 55.2% ophthalmologistssometimes explained, 18.2% had never heard of physiologicaldiplopia. Those who explained physiological diplopia ona regular basis reported significantly higher percentage ofpatients (46.3%) with good results as compared to those whosometimes explained (29.5%) and those who never explained(5.4%) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>].</p><p>For failure of PPT 86.7% ophthalmologists claimed lackof compliance as the major reason [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>]. While 54.8%ophthalmologists used placebo drugs, 45.2% did not use any,but there was no significant difference in the results.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Convergence insufficiency is a failure of the normal fusionalability of the eyes to maintain singular binocular vision ofany object at working distance. Duke-Elder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> defined CI as acondition with symptoms associated with NPC &#x0003e; 9.5 cm (fromthe apex of cornea) and FR &#x0003c; 30&#x000b0;.</p><p>Duke-Elder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> gave a detailed account of treatments givenfor CI. He found satisfactory results with described PPT. Othermodalities include synoptophore, use of lenses, bead strings,aperture rule, stereograms. In case active exercises fail, passivetreatment with base-in prisms is also suggested but not foundto be effective.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></p><p>Despite being a common problem there are only a fewstudies evaluating and comparing different treatmentmodalities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> The data about actual preferredmodalities by practicing ophthalmologists is not available. There is onlyone survey available of preferred clinical practices amongstophthalmologists and optometrists in the United States.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Theresults of that survey suggested that for the ophthalmologists,the most common treatment prescribed was PPT (50%) followedby home-based vision therapy (21%) and base-in prism (10%).The present survey is the first such survey in India.</p><p>The survey confirmed that CI is a common problem asperceived by ophthalmologists with 66.7% respondentssuggesting &#x0003e;5% of OPD patients with CI which is in agreementwith previous studies claiming 2-8% incidence, though it ismerely an estimate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> The criteria for diagnosis werevariable amongst ophthalmologists signifying lack of consensusamongst ophthalmologists regarding the diagnosis of CI.</p><p>Pencil push-ups therapy was used most commonly as thefirst line of treatment for CI (78.8% ophthalmologists). Only3.4% ophthalmologists preferred to refer the patient to theoptometrist, which indicated that in India the problem ofCI was mainly handled by the ophthalmologists rather thanoptometrists. Only 19% of the ophthalmologists claimedpoor results with PPT. The success rate was claimed to besignificantly higher when patients were treated by privatepractitioners (34.9%). This could be because of more timespent with the patient while explaining the exercises and moremotivation of the patients.</p><p>Those who explained physiological diplopia on a regularbasis claimed significantly better results as compared to thosewho sometimes explained and those who never explained(<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) This is a very important finding of the study. Ofthe ophthalmologists, 73.4% did not consider explainingphysiological diplopia as an integral part of convergenceexercises. This indicated lack of consensus and knowledgeabout PPT amongst the ophthalmologists which translatedinto poorer results than expected.</p><p>The majority of the ophthalmologists (86.7%) believed thatpoor compliance is the major cause of failure of PPT. Thisconcern has been repeatedly raised by many investigators.There was no significant difference in the perceived resultsamong those who used and did not use placebo drugs. Thissuggested that CI is not merely a psychogenic problem whichcan be treated by placebo therapy.</p><p>Synoptophore exercises are a good alternative to PPT, but23.2% ophthalmologists had no access to synoptophore. Amongothers, despite having access to synoptophore, only 12.3%referred &#x0003e;30% patients for synoptophore exercises.</p><p>Since this survey is based on the perception of the respondersand not on actual data, recall bias remains its major limitation,as with any other survey. Despite the limitation it provides theonly source of information about the clinical practice amongstprivate practitioners, consultants and residents.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This survey showed the perception of ophthalmologists that ahigh proportion of OPD patients complained of CI. There waslack of consensus and knowledge amongst the ophthalmologistsregarding the method of prescribing PPT, though PPT was themost common first line of treatment (78.8% ophthalmologists).Synoptophore is considered a good alternative to PPT, but therewas relative unavailability of instrument.</p><p>Explaining to the patient about physiological diplopia mightresult in improved success. Lack of compliance is a major causeof failure of exercises as believed by the ophthalmologists.Spending more time explaining to the patient the right wayto do the exercise and emphasis on compliance may improvethe success of treatment.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Source of Support: Nil</p></fn><fn><p>Conflict of Interest: None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref
