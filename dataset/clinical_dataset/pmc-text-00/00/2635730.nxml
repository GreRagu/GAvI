Of the cytokines measured interleukin (IL) -18 was the most prominently up-regulated cytokine in the serum of patients under long term JTT administration. We next evaluated the effects of JTT in mice, focusing especially on natural killer T (NKT) cell induction. Mice fed JTT were compared to control group ones. After sacrifice, the liver was fixed, embedded and stained. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations were performed. Although the mice receiving the herbal medicine had same appearance, their livers were infiltrated with massive mononuclear cells, some of which were aggregated to form clusters. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that there was abundant cytokine expression of IL-12 and IL-18 in the liver of JTT treated mice. To clarify what the key molecules that induce immunological restoration with JTT might be, we next examined <italic>in vitro</italic> lymphocyte cultures. Mononuclear cells isolated and prepared from healthy volunteers were cultured with and without JTT. Within 24 hours, JTT induced the IL-12 and IL-18 production and later (72 hours) induction of interferon (IFN)-gamma. Oral administration of JTT may induce the expression of IL-12 in the early stage, and IL-18 in the chronic stage, followed by NKT induction. Their activation, following immunological restoration could contribute to anti-tumor effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Japanese botanical medicine</kwd><kwd>Juzentaihoto</kwd><kwd>NKT</kwd><kwd>IL-12</kwd><kwd>IL-18</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Before the modern use of synthetic drugs, many medicines worldwide were derived from natural plant sources, including the nuts, roots and leaves. In Asian countries, especially in ancient China, many botanical materials had been adapted into medicines and these compositions have been described in old medicical encyclopedias.</p><p>Kampo originally means &#x0201c;Chinese style&#x0201d;, not only in medicine, but also for other Japanese words describing life styles. Kampo these days has come to mean &#x0201c;ethnical traditional medicine&#x0201d;. The principles of Kampo drugs were originally based on old Chinese traditional medicines and comprise about one hundred and fifty kinds of compositions of natural herbs and other natural products. Kampo medicine is generally characterized by its low frequency of severe adverse effects and is used in current clinical practice all over Japan and other countries.</p><p>Kampo products, for example, herbal extract granules for ethical use, were first included under the coverage of the Japanese public health insurance system in 1976 and currently, many clinical doctors in Japan apply these Kampo medicines along with Western chemically synthesized drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-7-1142">1</xref>].</p><p>Kampo traditional medicine is based on the long experience with its use in China and other oriental countries. The main theory of this medicine is based on the concept that diseases are caused from a disharmony of bodily flow and the aim of therapy is treating the patient as a body, not the disease. Consequently there can many ways to treat individual patients with the same disease.</p><p>&#x0201c;Sho&#x0201d;, the term of traditional Kampo medicine, refers to a particular pathological status of a patient evaluated by Kampo diagnosis, and is patterned according to the patient'sconstitution and symptoms, among other considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-7-1142">1</xref>]. Kampo preparations, including Japanese traditional botanical medicines, should be used after confirmation that it is suitable for the identified Sho of the patient.</p><p>Based on the particular diagnosis for Sho, some herbs and other natural materials should be compound into drugs. Originally they were taken as soluble extract in hot water just like tea, but now it can easily be taken as granular essence style drugs controlled under the Japanese Pharmacopoeia. Over ten pharmaceutical companies in Japan produce these granular style Kampo drugs for increased patient convenience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-7-1142">1</xref>].</p><p>Recently the use of alternative and complementary medicines in the Western countries has become more popular and some Kampo medicines can now be used in these countries. The use of Kampo style medicines is evolving how comprehensive medicine is practiced with established Western medical drugs.</p><p>Juzentaihoto (JTT), one of the Kampo Japanese herbal medicines was first described as SiQuan-Da-Bu-Tang in Daipinghuimin-Hejijufang (the Drug text book in Song Dynasty, 1151 A.D. in ancient China) and introduced into Japan in the Kamakura dynasty, about eight hundred years ago. The name of this drug originates from its Han&#x02013;letters. This is composed with four parts of characters in the name, &#x0201c;Juzen&#x0201d; means perfect, &#x0201c;tai&#x0201d; means great, &#x0201c;ho&#x0201d; means supplement, and &#x0201c;to&#x0201d; means water drug, respectively, and it consists from ten crude components obtained from natural herbs (shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-7-1142">Table 1</xref> from the 2006 Japanese Pharmacopoeia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-7-1142">2</xref>].</p><p>It has been mainly administrated to patients depressed or weakened by long illness to improve their general condition. The intended effect of this drug is to treat weakened conditions after illness, pale complexion, general fatigue, loss of appetite, night sweats, cold extremities, dry skin, dry mouth and anemia. Recently there have been some reports that JTT has anti-tumor effects and may prolong the survival of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-9-7-1142">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-9-7-1142">6</xref>]. Other reports describe that decreased occurrence of secondary carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-9-7-1142">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-9-7-1142">11</xref>].</p><p>These pharmacological mechanisms by which JTT exerts its effects have not yet been clarified. One study reports JTT cause the induction of interleukin (IL)-12 and subsequent activation of natural killer T (NKT) lymphoid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-7-1142">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-7-1142">13</xref>]. Other work mentions IL-18 induction as a possible result of JTT.</p><p>NKT cells are a type of lymphocyte characterized by their morphology which displays large granules in the plasma and has T cell receptors (TCR) with NK receptors, such as NK1.1. These cells have a role in both innate and adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-7-1142">14</xref>]. Cytokines, such as IL-12 and IL-18, are important activators of NKT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-9-7-1142">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-7-1142">18</xref>].</p><p>In this paper we describe experiments in designed to determine the ability of JTT to induce IL-12 and IL-18 and subsequent activation of NKT cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>2.

The quality of ten crude drugs shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-7-1142">Table 1</xref> is described by the 2006 Japanese Pharmacopeia. The patients who were treated in our hospital were taking JTT at a dosage of 7.5 g/day, 125 mg /kg/day or 4600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of. Mice were treated with 0.2% or 1.0% (w/w) drug mixed with chow. Assuming the mice weighed 25 g and ate 5 g per day, their exposures ranged from 1,200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> to 6,000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. The estimated dose levels in mice were calculated to bracket the estimated human exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2.

Results</title><sec><title>3.1. Serum cytokines</title><p>Serum from patients treated with JTT medicine showed no changes in the concentration of several serum cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, data not shown). These cytokines were undetectable by the ELISA in this study. These results of serum IL-18 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-7-1142">Figure 1</xref>. IL-18 levels were increased in patients treated with JTT for over one year, compared with sera from non-treated patients and healthy volunteers.

Discussion</title><p>Herbal prescriptions like Japanese Kampo medicine have been recognized for their potential and clinical usefulness. Recently, Juzentaihoto (JTT), one of these Japanese botanical medicines, has been reported to experimentally display anti-tumor effects against liver metastasis. Through this study we attempted to reveal a possible pharmacological mechanism of JTT's anti-tumor effects.</p><p>First we compared the serum cytokines from treated and non-treated patients. JTT treated patients in our study appeared to have high serum concentrations of IL-18, compared with non-treated patients, but the levels of IL -18 showed no relation to their disease status, as indicated by serum CRP. IL-18 was also up-regulated in serum from non JTT treated patients with liver cirrhosis, but to a lesser extent than in subjects treated with JTT. Although these patients do not formally have hepatocellular carcinoma, they represent a patient population at risk for developing liver cancer and may be viewed as pre-cancerous, which might be the reason for the elevated IL-18 levels in the untreated cirrhotic patients. IL-18 from the serum of autoimmune disease patients were also slightly up-regulated compared with healthy volunteers. This might be from activated immuno-reaction, but there is still question why the other cytokines were not changed. The evaluation of cytokines was performed with commercial ELISA kits according to manufacturer's methods. These kits have satisfactory potential of detection of cytokine in these sensitivity (most have pg/mL sensitivity) and specificity. We were unable to detect measureable levels of several cytokines in this study, but since many cytokines are transiently expressed <italic>in vivo</italic>, and decline rapidly following induction, the fact that we could not detect several of the cytokines tested is not surprising.</p><p>As the evaluation results of serum cytokines were not detected sufficiently in patient sera, we next constructed two experimental models. One is the cell culture method for <italic>in vitro</italic> cytokine production; the other is an animal model to look for tissue expression of cytokines <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Human lymphocyte cultures incubated with JTT produced elevated levels of both IL-12 and IL-18. One possible additional source of increased cytokines (i.e., IL -18) in the peripheral blood could be from mononuclear cells in tissues. INF-&#x003b3; production was also up-regulated following after IL-12 and IL-18. Up-regulation of this pathway could be involved in the anti-tumor effects of JTT administration via TH1 lymphoid effects.</p><p>Treatment of mice with JTT produced no significant changes for growth and liver function, yet in this study there were some interesting pathological results in the livers of JTT treated mice. Massive mononuclear cell infiltration and some of these were aggregated in clusters. These aggregated mononuclear cells are mainly considered NKT cells for their specific surface markers and for their characteristic intracellular structures.</p><p>This report also shows that JTT administration might induce IL-12, which has been originally described as a NKT cell stimulatory factor, as well as IL-18 expression. Our results revealed many mononuclear cells, including dendritic cells and Kupffer cells in liver tissue of JTT treated mice and expressed abundant IL-12 and 1L-18.</p><p>These cytokine expressions induced by JTT might be the reason of massive mononuclear cells, especially NKT cells infiltration and their activation, following immunological restoration could contribute to anti-tumor effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although there is some vagueness concerning the ingredients and pharmacological efficiency of the ten crude components of the Japanese botanical medicine Juzentaihoto, the consumption of natural herbs has certain inductive effect on NKT cells. Further studies for elucidate the efficacy of natural herbs for disease treatment are recommended. Cancer patients are always at risk of developing a secondary malignancy, and JTT may help to decrease this risk without severe adverse effects. JTT, one of Japanese herbal medicine administration might be the alternative strategy of treatment for cancer patients to prevent secondary oncogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are very thankful to Dr. Dennis M.
