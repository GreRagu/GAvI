Here, we use biochemical and cellular approaches to probe the impact of XLF on LX activities. We show that XLF stimulates adenylation of LX complexes de-adenylated by pyrophosphate or following LX decharging during ligation. XLF enhances LX ligation activity in an ATP-independent and dependent manner. ATP-independent stimulation can be attributed to enhanced end-bridging. Whilst ATP alone fails to stimulate LX ligation activity, addition of XLF and ATP promotes ligation in a manner consistent with XLF-stimulated readenylation linked to ligation. We show that XLF is a weakly bound partner of the tightly associated LX complex and, unlike XRCC4, is dispensable for LX stability. 2BN cells, which have little, if any, residual XLF activity, show a 3-fold decreased ability to repair DNA double strand breaks covering a range of complexity. These findings strongly suggest that XLF is not essential for NHEJ but promotes LX adenylation and hence ligation. We propose a model in which XLF, by <italic>in situ</italic> recharging DNA ligase IV after the first ligation event, promotes double stranded ligation by a single LX complex.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is the major mechanism for the repair of radiation induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. Cell lines lacking NHEJ components are exquisitely radiosensitive and DSB repair defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). NHEJ also functions to effect rearrangements at site-specific DSBs introduced during V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Consequently, viable mice lacking NHEJ proteins show severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Patients deficient in NHEJ components have also been described. Most patients show varying degrees of combined immunodeficiency, microcephaly and developmental delay and cell lines derived from them display radiosensitivity, which leads to the classification of radiosensitive-(RS)-SCID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6 B7">4&#x02013;7</xref>). One patient received radiotherapy and dramatically over-responded to treatment demonstrating clinical radiosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>The first step of NHEJ is binding of the heterodimeric Ku protein to double stranded (ds) DNA ends. Crystallography studies on Ku have shown that it can encircle DNA with a central core of sufficient diameter to allow the threading and translocation of Ku onto dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Once bound to DNA, Ku recruits the DNA&#x02013;PK catalytic subunit (DNA&#x02013;PKcs), creating the active DNA&#x02013;PK holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that DNA&#x02013;PK undergoes autophosphorylation, which regulates the process and/or facilitates the recruitment of additional proteins required for end processing, such as Artemis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The assembled DNA&#x02013;PK complex facilitates the recruitment of a ligation complex encompassing XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>XLF-Cernunnos, hereafter called XLF, was identified via the analysis of a class of RS-SCID patients with features closely resembling those of LIG4 syndrome patients, a disorder caused by mutations in DNA ligase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This strongly suggested that XLF is a component of the NHEJ machinery, which is substantiated by the finding that XLF interacts with XRCC4 and is co-recruited with NHEJ components to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Furthermore, it has recently been reported that Ku plays a role in recruiting XLF to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Interestingly, XLF was predicted, and has now been shown, to have a structure similar to, but distinct from, that of XRCC4 with an N-terminal globular head domain and C-terminal coiled coil structure, which is shorter than that in XRCC4 and directed towards the N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Furthermore, XLF represents the mammalian homologue of the yeast Nej1p protein, a factor regulating NHEJ in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Since both <italic>LIG4</italic> and <italic>XLF</italic>-deficient cell lines are proficient in Ku end-binding activity and display normal DNA&#x02013;PK activity, the available data provides strong evidence that XLF is a further factor required for ligation during NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The co-immunoprecipitation of XLF with LX has lead to the suggestion of a tripartite XLF&#x02013;XRCC4&#x02013;ligase IV complex, although a more recent study has suggested that XLF does not impact on LX association or DSB recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). XLF has been reported to promote LX ligation potentially by enhancing end-bridging because of its ability to bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, multiple proteins are able to promote end-bridging <italic>in vitro</italic> including DNA&#x02013;PKcs and Ku, and DNA ends might also be partially tethered by higher order DNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25">23&#x02013;25</xref>). XLF has also been reported to be involved specifically in the ligation of mismatched and noncohesive DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Here, we examine in further detail the impact of XLF on LX activities.</p><p>The ligation reaction involves an initial charging step generating a DNA ligase IV&#x02013;adenylate complex followed by transfer of the AMP moiety to the 5&#x02032; phosphate on DNA creating a DNA&#x02013;adenylate complex and releasing uncharged DNA ligase IV, which needs to be re-adenylated for subsequent ligation. A recent study characterizing LX based on its nick ligation activity highlighted that, in contrast to other DNA ligases, LX re-adenylation following ligation proceeds very slowly and is rate limiting <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In support of this, we have never observed any stimulation of LX-mediated ds ligation by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have used biochemical and cellular approaches to probe the role of XLF in NHEJ. We provide the first demonstration that XLF stimulates LX adenylation following ligation, which enhances the ability of LX complexes to stimulate ds ligation in the presence of ATP. To gain insight into the <italic>in vivo</italic> impact of XLF function, we examined two lines harbouring mutations in XLF. We demonstrate that 2BN cells have little, if any, residual XLF function but manifest only a 3-fold decrease in rejoining DSBs covering a range of complexities. Our findings provide evidence that XLF stimulates but is non-essential for NHEJ.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary fibroblasts, 1BR3 (control), 2BN and F07/402 (XLF-deficient), 180BR and 495GOS (LIGIV-deficient), hTERT immortalized fibroblasts, 48BRhT (control), 2BNhT, 180BRhT, 495GOShT, and SV-40 transformed human fibroblasts, MRC5BIVA, were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).

Firstly, we examined whether XLF impacts upon LX adenylation activity. Since we were unable to purify a co-expressed trimeric complex because of the weak association of XLF with LX at greater than physiological salt concentrations (see below), we used separately purified, bacterially expressed XLF and insect cell-expressed LX. LX is expressed in insect cells as a pre-adenylate complex and assessment of adenylation activity is normally carried out following de-adenylation by inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), which causes AMP release. Incubation of the de-adenylated complex with radioactively labelled &#x003b1;-ATP generates a labelled AMP&#x02013;LX (adenylate) complex that can be detected on an SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel. Using 5 pmol of XLF and 1 pmol of LX, we observed 2&#x02013;3-fold stimulation in the rate of adenylation over 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A; gels shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn957/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1A</ext-link>). A similar degree of stimulation was observed using between 5 and 30 pmol XLF (data not shown).<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>XLF stimulates ligase IV re-adenylation following ligation. (<bold>A</bold>) LX was treated with pyrophosphate (PPi) for 15 min at room temperature. Following dialysis, 1 pmol LX was incubated with &#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP with or without 5 pmol XLF.

(<bold>D</bold>) Samples treated as in (C) were examined for ligation by gel electrophoresis. Ligation occurred during the preincubation step and peaked by 15 min. (<bold>E</bold>) Total 0.2 pmol LX were incubated with 0.8 pmol DNA ends with or without 1 pmol XLF without ATP for 15 min. Samples were examined for ligation.

The graph shows arbitrary units of intensity of adenylation normalized to protein levels.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn957f1"/></fig></p><p>We and others have previously observed that re-adenylation of LX following ligation is very inefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Therefore, we considered the possibility that XLF might play a role in recharging LX following ligation. We first examined the impact of ligatable DNA on adenylation using LX complexes previously de-adenylated by PPi treatment. We utilized a 445-bp pBluescript fragment, which we have previously used in ds ligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), and observed that the presence of DNA decreases adenylate complex formation regardless of the presence of XLF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn957/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1B</ext-link>). This suppressive impact was more marked at later times consistent with ligation causing LX de-adenylation thereby reducing the overall amount of adenylate complex observed.</p><p>To determine whether XLF stimulates re-adenylation following ligation, we adapted our assay to examine adenylate complex formation without prior de-charging of LX complexes by PPi treatment. Instead, we examined re-adenylation of LX following de-charging by ligation. To achieve this, we allowed ligation to take place in the absence of ATP, with or without XLF, during a 15 min pre-incubation step prior to addition of radiolabelled &#x003b1;-ATP to monitor adenylate complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn957/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1C</ext-link>). XLF promoted LX adenylation following incubation in the presence of DNA, while such activity occurred slowly in the absence of XLF, providing the first demonstration that significant re-adenylation of LX can occur following ligation. To verify that ligation had taken place, we monitored ligation during the pre-incubation phase in the absence of ATP and subsequently when ATP (with or without XLF) was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). We observed ligation products during the pre-incubation reaction consistent with de-adenylation occurring as a consequence of ligation. However, ligation peaked at 15 min and further stimulation following addition of ATP was not observed either in the presence or absence of XLF. This is likely due to the fact that only a small fraction of LX complexes are recharged during the reaction since optimization of our ability to detect LX&#x02013;<sup>32</sup>P&#x02013;adenylate complex formation required using radiolabelled ATP without added cold ATP. Thus, the ATP concentrations (66 nM) are likely below the optimal <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for ATP for DNA ligase IV. The presence of XLF during the 15 min pre-incubation step did not increase either the rate of LX adenylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) or the level of ligation (data not shown), suggesting that XLF may not enhance ligation without prior de-adenylation of LX. However, in this experiment an excess of LX to substrate (5:1) was utilized, potentially limiting any ability to detect XLF stimulatory activity. We, therefore, modified the assay to examine the impact of XLF on ligation under LX rate-limiting conditions (1:4 ratio of LX to DNA ends) but still failed to observe any marked stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). These findings show that while XLF does not markedly stimulate ligation during the pre-incubation phase, it markedly enhances the rate of adenylation. Thus, we demonstrate that there is an impact on LX re-charging that cannot be attributed to any marked impact of XLF on ligation. We also examined the stimulation of adenylation in the presence of non-ligatable DNA. We used a blunt ended DNA substrate since blunt ended DNA is a poor substrate in our <italic>in vitro</italic> ligation reaction. Blunt-ended DNA failed to stimulate either adenylation or ligation activity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn957/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). Thus, we conclude that the stimulation of adenylation by XLF in this assay follows de-adenylation by ligation.</p><p>Finally, to examine whether XLF stimulates LX adenylation using physiologically relevant ratios of XLF and LX, we used &#x003b1;-XRCC4 antibodies to immunoprecipitate LX-XLF complexes from extracts from a human pre-B cell line using 0.12 M NaCl and employed a high salt (1 M NaCl) wash to discharge XLF (see below). This allows a comparison of the impact of XLF in the same cellular background. De-adenylation of LX was carried out by PPi treatment or by incubation with DNA (445-bp pBluescript fragment). XLF stimulated LX adenylation activity following PPi treatment (+PPi, 1 M NaCl versus +PPi, 0.12 M NaCl) but strikingly, stimulation was even greater when LX was de-charged by DNA (+DNA, 1 M NaCl versus +DNA, 0.12 M NaCl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F). Thus, even though our biochemical studies require a ratio of XLF to LX greater than one, potentially due to a percentage of inactive XLF in the XLF preparations, the ratio of XLF to LX obtained by co-immunoprecipitation was also able to stimulate LX re-adenylation linked to ligation, confirming our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings.</p></sec><sec><title>ATP-dependent and independent stimulation of LX double-stranded ligation by XLF</title><p>Previous studies have shown that XLF stimulates LX ds ligation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Our finding that XLF stimulates LX recharging following ligation predicted that XLF stimulation of ligation should be ATP-dependent. Although we were unable to observe XLF stimulation of ligation in the experiments described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), this was potentially attributable to the low ATP concentration utilized in the assay. We, therefore, examined the impact of concentrations of ATP in the physiological range (2 mM) on the ability of XLF to stimulate LX ds ligation. First, we titrated the amount of XLF stimulating 125 fmol LX, which effects only a low level of ligation and observed a broad peak of stimulation from 2.5 to 30 pmol XLF, which varied slightly with individual LX preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). We next examined the ability of 17 pmol XLF to stimulate ligation effected by differing amounts of LX in the presence or absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). In the absence of XLF, little ds ligation was observed. In agreement with previous findings and the discussion above, addition of ATP alone did not stimulate LX activity consistent with the dramatically reduced ability of LX to undergo re-adenylation post ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, compare left and right panels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). XLF provided some stimulation in the absence of ATP but further stimulation was observed in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, right panel). Significantly, when high amounts of LX were employed (50 fmol) with or without ATP, XLF provided no further stimulation, consistent with the notion that LX is not rate limiting and that ds ligation can occur by two independent ligation events. These findings provide strong evidence that XLF can stimulate adenylation under physiological ATP concentrations and moreover, that such stimulation can enhance ds ligation.<fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>XLF stimulates LX double stranded ligation in an ATP-dependent and independent manner.

XLF could not stimulate the ligation reaction in the presence of AMPCPP to the level reach in the presence of ATP.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn957f2"/></fig></p><p>It has been suggested that XLF might function as a bridging factor to facilitate alignment and rejoining of ds DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). To examine this, we used a pull-down assay in which the 445-bp duplex substrate used for ligation was biotin labelled and bound to magnetic streptavidin beads and incubated together with XLF and <sup>32</sup>P-end-labelled substrate. Intermolecular substrate association was assessed by monitoring the ability of streptavidin beads to retain the <sup>32</sup>P-labelled duplex following multiple washes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). XLF enhanced the recovery of radiolabelled DNA associated with beads demonstrating that it facilitates DNA end-bridging. As a control, DNA&#x02013;PK holoenzyme (DNA&#x02013;PKcs&#x02013;Ku80/70), which also promotes end-bridging, caused a similar increase in duplex-bridging activity, and XLF and DNA&#x02013;PK holoenzyme together did not show any additive effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). These findings support the notion that XLF promotion of ligation in the absence of ATP might be attributable to its ability to promote end-bridging. The experiments carried out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D used a low XLF to LX molar ratio (&#x0223c;5:1), optimized to observe the stimulatory effect of XLF on LX adenylation. In contrast, the ligation experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B used a higher molar ratio of XLF to LX (&#x0223c;75:1). Since the ratio of LX to DNA ends remains essentially the same (&#x0223c;5:1 versus &#x0223c;2:1, respectively), it is possible that the higher level of XLF is required to promote DNA end bridging. Multiple proteins promote end-bridging and stimulate <italic>in vitro</italic> ligation reactions. Since XLF interacts with LX, we considered that this might provide an added impact on ligation <italic>in</italic> vivo but was unlikely to represent the unique function of XLF in NHEJ.</p><p>The ATP-dependent impact of XLF is unique, however, and consistent with the notion that XLF promotes LX recharging. To further examine this, we looked at the impact of XLF on the kinetics and maximal level of ligation with or without ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). In the absence of XLF (diamonds), there is hardly any ligation going on. In the absence of ATP, stimulation of ligation by XLF occurred within the first few minutes and little further stimulation was observed (squares). ATP together with XLF also enhanced the ligation within the first few minutes (triangles) but the maximal level obtained was higher than that observed in the absence of ATP. We conclude that XLF stimulates ds LX ligation activity in two ways, one being ATP-independent and the other ATP-dependent. In the presence of ATP, XLF enhances the maximal level of ligation consistent with our findings that it promotes recharging of LX following ligation. We also used an ATP analogue, AMPCPP, which cannot be hydrolysed to AMP and thus cannot generate an LX&#x02013;adenylate complex. The level of stimulation of ligation observed in the presence of AMPCPP was less than that observed in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E) and, interestingly, was similar to that observed in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D).</p></sec><sec><title>XLF is dispensable for DNA ligase IV stability and is a weaker binding partner of the stable LX complex</title><p>To examine XLF function <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used the 2BN cell line, which was derived from a patient with SCID with a single base pair (+T) insertion at position 11 (11insT) in the first coding exon of <italic>XLF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The insertion introduces a frameshift and creates a termination codon at position 139. Thus, the mutant protein only shares the first four amino acids with the wild-type protein. Using polyclonal antibodies raised to bacterially expressed, full-length, human XLF (&#x003b1;-XLF), we were unable to detect any residual XLF protein in 2BN cell extracts by immunofluorescence or immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B) despite a strong signal obtained with control cell extracts consolidating previous analysis of 2BN cells using a distinct &#x003b1;-XLF antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). We were also unable to detect any smaller XLF fragments in 2BN cell extracts providing no evidence for translational re-initiation (data not shown). Given the lack of any significant XLF expression in 2BN cells, we examined the interdependence of XLF, XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV expression on protein stability. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence showed that XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV are expressed normally and localize to the nucleus in 2BN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). In contrast, XR-1 cells, which lack XRCC4, express low levels of DNA ligase IV, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Moreover, XRCC4 expression in a <italic>LIG4</italic> null cell line, N114P2, is approximately one third reduced compared to the parent line, Nalm6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). XLF was expressed normally in DNA ligase IV-defective N114P2 cells. XLF expression in XR-1 cells could not be assessed since the &#x003b1;-XLF antibodies do not cross-react with hamster XLF. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that, whereas XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV are co-dependent for normal expression, XLF is dispensable for the stability of both XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV. Conversely, DNA ligase IV is dispensable for XLF stability and nuclear localization.<fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>XLF is dispensable for DNA ligase IV stability and can be dissociated from the stable LX complex.

We included two LIG4 cell lines for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

The second XLF defective patient, F07/402, was similar in severity displaying SCID, microcephaly and developmental delay. Both XLF-deficient cell lines showed slow but residual DSB rejoining similar to that observed in the LIG4 cell lines.

Cells treated with scrambled siRNA gave identical results to untreated cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn957f4"/></fig></p><p>The interpretation of these findings requires an evaluation of the impact of the mutational changes. F07/402 harbours a homozygous R57X (C169T) mutation, which is predicted to result in a severely truncated protein. Even a point mutational change at R57, which was observed in another XLF patient and was modelled onto the XLF structure, was predicted to be highly destabilizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Thus, it is highly likely that this cell line will not retain residual XLF function. We were unable to examine XLF expression in these poorly growing cells. 2BN cells harbour a homozygous 11insT mutation and have no detectable residual XLF protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Even if there was a low level of read through of the termination codon at position 139, the majority of the cDNA would be out of frame and likely non-functional. However, the use of in-frame translational initiation codons producing a C-terminal fragment could potentially lead to residual activity. Using polyclonal antibodies raised to bacterially expressed full-length human XLF protein (&#x003b1;-XLF), we failed to detect expression of any fragments in 2BN cell extracts of the anticipated size (data not shown). To examine further whether a downstream initiation codon might be utilized, we transfected wild type or mutant C-terminal HA-tagged <italic>XLF</italic> cDNA (C-HA-XLF<sup>WT</sup> or C-HA-XLF<sup>11insT</sup>) into MRC5BIVA cells and examined protein expression using &#x003b1;-XLF and &#x003b1;-HA antibodies from cell extracts or following immunoprecipitation using &#x003b1;-HA antibodies. Transfection with C-HA-XLF<sup>WT</sup> cDNA resulted in expression of XLF detectable using &#x003b1;-XLF and &#x003b1;-HA antibodies, either with or without &#x003b1;-HA immunoprecipitation. No residual XLF protein or any smaller fragments were detectable following transfection with C-HA-XLF<sup>11insT</sup> cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Indeed, the only bands present were those observed using an empty vector expressing HA alone. We conclude that there is unlikely to be residual expression of C-terminal XLF fragments in 2BN cells.</p><p>To gain further evidence that 2BN cells might lack residual XLF function, we carried out XLF siRNA using 1BRhT cells and observed impaired DSB rejoining albeit less marked than that observed in 2BNhT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Notably, the DSB rejoining in 2BNhT cells subjected to XLF siRNA was unchanged. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that 2BN cells are unlikely to retain significant residual XLF expression and hence function. Since their rate of DSB rejoining is reduced only 3-fold compared to control cells, this strongly suggests that XLF facilitates but is not essential for NHEJ.</p></sec><sec><title>2BN cells are similarly impaired in rejoining DSBs induced by Etoposide and Neocarzinostatin</title><p>To examine whether XLF might be required for the repair of a specific class of DNA ends, we examined the rate of DSB repair in 2BN following exposure to two additional DNA damaging agents that induce different types of DSBs. Neocarzinostatin produces a relatively homogenous type of DSB possessing 3&#x02032; phosphoglycolate and 5&#x02032; phosphate termini, which lack the complexity of radiation induced DSBs. Etoposide, an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, also induces a homogenous class of DSB bound by an inactive topoisomerase II molecule.

Two impacts for XLF on ligation have been described; first, the stimulation of ligation has been suggested to occur via an end-bridging mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) and second, XLF has been reported to promote the ligation of mismatched and noncohesive DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>We examined the impact of XLF on LX activities. XLF stimulated LX adenylation activity following de-adenylation by PPi treatment, and also promoted its re-adenylation following ligation, a rate limiting reaction. As a consequence of this recharging, we observed a stimulation of LX-mediated ds ligation under physiological concentrations of ATP. This stimulation did not occur in the presence of an ATP analogue that cannot be hydrolysed to AMP and PPi. Taken together, our findings show that XLF enhances a range of LX activities in the presence or absence of DNA. A fundamental impact on LX activities is consistent with structural studies and demonstrates an effect that does not depend solely on enhanced end-bridging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>XRCC4 has also been shown to stimulate adenylation in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). We have not been able to express sufficient levels of DNA ligase IV alone to examine whether XLF stimulates DNA ligase IV in the absence of XRCC4. However, since our experiments are conducted with LX complexes, the impact of XLF must be additive to any impact of XRCC4.</p><p>XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV form a stable complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Moreover, DNA ligase IV is poorly expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of XRCC4 and, although less dramatic, XRCC4 expression is reduced <italic>in vivo</italic> in the absence of DNA ligase IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). In contrast, 2BN cells, despite having no detectable XLF protein or residual function, have normal levels of XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV. Furthermore, XLF is stable in the absence of DNA ligase IV. The interaction of XLF with LX is severely reduced even at moderate ionic strength (&#x02265;0.3 M NaCl) and, although we were able to co-express XLF, XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV in insect cells, we failed to purify an intact complex with XLF separating from the LX complex even following a mild purification procedure. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the XLF&#x02013;XRCC4&#x02013;DNA ligase IV relationship is not an equal partnership with XLF being less tightly bound to the strongly associated XRCC4&#x02013;DNA LigIV heterodimer. Moreover, XLF cannot fulfil an important function of XRCC4, namely the stabilization and solubilization of DNA ligase IV. These findings are consistent with the recently described structural studies on XLF, which have revealed a structure that overlaps with, but is distinct, to XRCC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Our findings are also consistent with a study showing that XLF does not impact on LX association or recruitment to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>The clinical features of LIG4 syndrome and XLF-deficient patients are overlapping, which is, perhaps, surprising given that XLF stimulates but is non-essential for LX activity. We compared two XLF-deficient cell lines, F07/402 and 2BN, with two LIG4-deficient lines. Since LIG4 is essential, all LIG4 cell lines harbour hypomorphic mutations with residual protein being detectable, and residual activity, where analysed in detail, ranging from 1% to 10% of control activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). 180BR cells were derived from a mild LIG4 patient who did not display overt immunodeficiency but showed an over-response to radiotherapy. The cells harbour a homozygous point mutational change (R287H) that reduces LIG4 ds ligation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). 495GOS cells were derived from a more clinically severe patient who required bone marrow transplantation at an early age but expressed detectable residual DNA ligase IV protein. The two XLF patients also had severe immunodeficiency that necessitated bone marrow transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) (unpublished clinical investigations). 2BN cells retain little, if any, residual function since (i) the mutation causes a highly truncated protein with no evidence of re-initiation, (ii) there is no detectable residual protein and (iii) there is no added impact of XLF siRNA on DSB repair. Whilst LigIV and XRCC4 null cell lines show a near lack of DSB rejoining in G0 phase, the LIG4 and XLF patient cell lines show markedly impaired but residual DSB rejoining. The residual DSB rejoining in LIG4 syndrome cell lines demonstrates the substantial residual DSB rejoining conferred by the hypomorphic mutations. Interestingly, the 180BR cell line, derived from the clinically mild patient, displays a slightly milder DSB repair defect in the &#x003b3;H2AX assay compared to the more clinically severe 495GOS patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). The DSB repair defects in both XLF cell lines lie between the two LIG4 syndrome cell lines. Thus, despite the differential impacts of XLF and DNA ligase IV on ligation activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, the patient cell lines display overlapping DSB repair deficiencies, providing an explanation for their overlapping clinical features. Although it is difficult to entirely rule out the impact of low residual XLF activity, these cellular studies, taken together with our biochemical analysis, strongly suggest that, unlike DNA ligase IV and XRCC4, which are essential for NHEJ, XLF is facilitating but non-essential and enhances DSB rejoining around 3-fold <italic>in vivo</italic>. Recently, Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) described an XLF-deficient mouse deleted for exons 4/5. Although it is unclear if this represents a null phenotype, the mouse was viable unlike XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV null mice. Since the essential role of XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV appears to represent NHEJ, this finding is consistent with our notion that XLF has a non-essential role in NHEJ compared to XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV. Interestingly, XLF appears to be dispensable for lymphoid development in mice suggesting that in lymphoid cells, at least, it is not an essential NHEJ component.</p><p>On the basis of our findings, we propose a working model whereby LX can be recharged <italic>in situ</italic> following ligation to promote ds ligation by a single DNA ligase IV molecule. The reduced rate of DSB rejoining in the absence of XLF could reflect its occurrence by two independent ligation events. The stoichiometry of NHEJ rejoining proteins is currently unknown. It is likely that a Ku heterodimer binds to a DSB end and recruits one DNA&#x02013;PKcs subunit per end. However, whether one or two ligase complexes are recruited to carry out the two ligation reactions is currently unclear. The recent structural studies show that the interaction between XRCC4 and XLF occurs through their head domains, but the exact stoichiometry of the complex has not been defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Li <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that the most consistent stoichiometry was a 2:2:1 XRCC4&#x02013;XLF&#x02013;ligase IV complex but the number of these complexes at a DSB is not clear. Our model would predict a complex which would only contain a single molecule of ligase IV.</p><p>XLF has also been shown to promote rejoining of mismatched and non-cohesive ends <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Our findings are not incompatible with these results, since the ability to recharge LX could enhance end processing linked to ligation. It is important to note, however, that our ligation uses compatible DNA ends. Furthermore, we did not observe any evidence from our <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis for a differential impact of XLF-mediated rejoining of readily ligatable ends generated by Etoposide compared to ends generated by Neocarzinostatin, which are relatively homogeneous and thus should all require or be independent of XLF, nor those generated by radiation, which cover a range of complexities. It is also noteworthy that XLF is required for the rejoining of the signal ends generated during V(D)J recombination <italic>in vivo</italic>, which arise as blunt ds ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Our findings are consistent with the ability of XLF to enhance, but not be essential for, all DSB rejoining <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is interesting to note also that, Nej1p, the yeast homologue of XLF, appears to be dispensable for NHEJ at low levels of DSBs, which would be consistent with a non-essential role in promoting re-adenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we provide the first demonstration that XLF stimulates LX adenylation activity, and that this can promote ds ligation in the presence of ATP by recharging LX following ligation. We examine two XLF-deficient cell lines, which have little, if any, residual XLF function and show that they have approximately 3-fold slower DSB rejoining activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. We suggest that XLF is non-essential for NHEJ but facilitates DSB rejoining by enhancing LX adenylation and hence ligation. We suggest a model whereby XLF enhances ds ligation by recharging LX to promote ds ligation by a single DNA ligase IV molecule.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn957/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Medical Research Council; the Association for International Cancer Research; the Department of Health, European Community Integrated project DNA repair (LSHG-CT-2005-512113); European Union RiscRad (FI6R-CT-2003-508842-).
