Due to the inherent difficulties created by cysteine, the power of one-bead one-compound (OBOC) libraries has never been applied to the discovery of short cysteine-rich peptides. We have developed the first method for the synthesis, screening, and sequencing of cysteine-rich OBOC peptide libraries. First, we synthesized a heavily biased cysteine-rich OBOC library, incorporating 50% cysteine at each position (Ac-X<sub>8</sub>-KM-TentaGel). Then, we developed conditions for cysteine alkylation, cyanogen bromide cleavage, and direct MS/MS sequencing of that library at the single bead level. The sequencing efficiency of this library was comparable to a traditional cysteine-free library. To validate screening of cysteine-rich OBOC libraries, we reacted a library with the biarsenical FlAsH and identified beads bearing the known biarsenical-binding motif (CCXXCC). These results enable OBOC libraries to be used in high-throughput discovery of cysteine-rich peptides for protein tagging, environmental remediation of metal contaminants, or cysteine-rich pharmaceuticals.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>cc800087y</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>cc-2008-00087y</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cysteine-rich peptides are of significant and growing interest due to the increasing use of tetracysteine tags for fluorescence imaging of living cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>) and as tools for bioremediation and phytoremediation of toxic heavy metal contaminants such as cadmium and mercury.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>) A library of 205 designed tetracysteine peptides immobilized on cellulose has been successfully screened against biarsenical probes.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>) But, the drawback is that these spatially addressed libraries tend to be orders of magnitude smaller than biological or bead-based libraries.

After screening an OBOC library and isolating bead hits, there are either indirect or direct approaches to identify the sequences of these library hits.

The first problem we encountered was centered on the reactivity of the cysteine thiols. While there is precedent for chemoselective cyanogen bromide cleavage of full-length proteins containing cysteine,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) we found that cyanogen bromide cleavage of the cysteine-rich peptide led to a wide range of side products (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), presumably due to thiocyanate and disulfide formation. To overcome these problems with cyanogen bromide cleavage, we first treated the beads with dithiothreitol (DTT) and then alkylated the cysteine thiols with iodoacetamide in a sodium carbonate buffer.

Ile was excluded because Leu and Ile are isobaric (have exactly the same mass). Lysine was included near the C-terminus to favor the formation of y-ions in the MS/MS spectrum of the doubly charged peptide. The library was biased toward cysteine by coupling half of the resin to Fmoc-tritylcysteine during each round of coupling. Fourteen beads were selected at random from the library and subjected to the cysteine alkylation and cyanogen bromide cleavage conditions. The samples were then subjected to nanoflow LC-MS/MS for sequencing of the doubly charged molecular ions. For these cleaved peptides, which are different from traditional tryptic peptides, manual interpretation of the MS/MS spectra proved to be more reliable than automated interpretation. The MS/MS for the peptide cleaved from bead Cys01 (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), and all beads from this library, exhibits a peak at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 230 corresponding to the y<sub>2</sub>-ion derived from the C-terminal Lys-Hsl.

In cases where the y-series of ions was incomplete, b-ions could resolve ambiguities near the N-terminus. Of the 14 crude cleavage samples, four did not exhibit a significant doubly charged ion required for good MS/MS fragmentation. Ten of the samples exhibited a doubly charged molecular ion amenable to sequencing, and nine of these samples yielded unambiguous sequences for Cys01&#x02212;Cys09 (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The main product from bead Cys06 was found to be a truncated peptide, probably due to a problematic coupling step during synthesis.

The protecting groups were removed by treatment of the resin with 94% TFA, 2.5% ethanedithiol, 2.5% H<sub>2</sub>O, and 1% triisopropylsilane for 3 h. Following cleavage, the beads were washed with methanol (3 &#x000d7; 50 mL) and pH 7.2 buffer (3 &#x000d7; 50 mL).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Single Bead Isolation and Preparation</title><p>The bead library was suspended in 50 mL pH 7.2 aqueous solution. To select random beads from the library, 200 &#x003bc;L of suspended beads were transferred to a 90 mm Petri dish using a P200 Pipetman. Individual beads were taken up with the P200 Pipetman under a 50&#x000d7; dissecting microscope and transferred to a prewashed (2 &#x000d7; 250 &#x003bc;L, methanol) Millipore Ultrafree-MC spin tube with a 0.22 &#x003bc;m Durapore PVDF membrane. The bead was separated from solvent by centrifugal filtration by spinning at 12&#x02009;000 rpm in a benchtop microcentrifuge. To avoid loss of the single bead, it is essential to confirm by microscope that the bead is at the bottom of the spin tube between washes. Beads were subsequently washed with 30% aqueous methanol (2 &#x000d7; 100 &#x003bc;L). Small wash volumes and gentle agitation were used to confine the bead to the bottom of the spin filter.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>Bead Sample Alkylation</title><p>The cysteine sidechains of beads isolated from cysteine-containing libraries were reduced and alkylated to prevent side reactions during cyanogen bromide cleavage: to each tube was added 100 &#x003bc;L of 50 mM DTT buffered with 0.4 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> in 30% aqueous methanol, and the tube was shaken for 1 h. Next, 40 &#x003bc;L of 0.5 M iodoacetamide in 30% aqueous methanol was added to each tube. After shaking for 30 min, 150 &#x003bc;L of 50 mM DTT buffered with 0.4 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> in 30% aqueous methanol was added and the tube was shaken for 15 min. Finally, the alkylation mixture was spun through the spin tube and the tube progresses to the rinsing phase.</p><p>Still inside of the spin tube, the bead was rinsed with 3:7 methanol/0.1% aqueous formic acid (2 &#x000d7; 100 &#x003bc;L) and 1:1 CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>/MeOH (2 &#x000d7; 100 &#x003bc;L). The bead was then transferred as a suspension in 50 &#x003bc;L MeOH to a PCR tube. The MeOH was evaporated under vacuum, leaving the bead in bottom of the tube. The presence and location of the bead was verified under the microscope. To each PCR tube was added 30 &#x003bc;L of a solution of 20 mg/mL cyanogen bromide in 0.1 M HCl. The cleavage reactions were run for 8 h at room temperature in the dark. Each tube was covered from light and was then frozen at &#x02212;78 &#x000b0;C, and the solvent was removed by lyophilization. A solution of aqueous formic acid in acetonitrile (30 &#x003bc;L of 1:1 (V/V) 0.1% formic acid/MeCN) was added to the PCR tubes, that were then vortexed for one minute to dissolve the residue. The solution was then transferred to a vial for LC-QTOF analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>Bead Sample Sequencing</title><p>Samples were analyzed on a Waters QTOF2 mass spectrometer in positive ion mode equipped with a Waters nanoAcquity HPLC (column: Waters Symmetry 100 &#x003bc; &#x000d7; 100 mm C18 1.7 &#x003bc;m particle size). Doubly charged ions were selected and isolated for sequencing by survey scanning during chromatographic analyses. The flow rate was 350 nL/min ramped from 5% B to 80% B over 40 min. (A = 94.9% H<sub>2</sub>O 5% acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid. B = acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid.) The electrospray voltage was 3 kV and the cone voltage 30 V. To assist nebulization, nitrogen gas was used at approximately 5 psi. Argon was used as the collision gas at 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> Torr on the analyzer&#x02019;s Penning gauge.</p><p>The MS/MS spectra were interpreted manually, primarily by assigning the peaks corresponding to the C-terminal y-ions. The y-ion peaks were abundant since every cleaved peptide had LysHsl (Hsl = homoserine lactone) at the C-terminus. The interpretation of the spectra was simplified because the formation of b-ions was suppressed as a result of <italic>N</italic>-terminal acetylation.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><title>Screening a Cysteine-Biased Library with FlAsH-EDT<sub>2</sub></title><p>A cysteine-rich OBOC library (0.33 g; Ac-(Xxx)<sub>8</sub>LysMet; Xxx = 50% Cys; &#x02260; Met, Ile) was first prescreened to remove fluorescent beads. The beads were transferred to a 50 mL solid phase synthesis vessel. Once inside the 50 mL vessel, the library was washed with 70:30 100 mM potassium bicarbonate/MeOH (2 &#x000d7; 30 &#x003bc;L). The beads were transferred to, and suspended in, a 90 mm Petri dish using 30 mL of 100 mM potassium bicarbonate and observed in the dark under an 8 W long wave UV lamp (Spectroline ENF-280C) with a stereo microscope (15&#x000d7;&#x02212;45&#x000d7; magnification). Seven weakly fluorescent beads were removed from the library.</p><p>The library was then transferred back to the solid phase synthesis vessel for screenng using 100 mM potassium bicarbonate. At this point three beads bearing the sequence Ac-WDCCPGCCKM, suspended in 10 mL deionized water, were added to the vessel using a 200 &#x003bc;L Pipetman. The library was then washed (3 &#x000d7; 50 mL) with a potassium-rich phosphate buffer (15 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2) containing 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100. To the washed library in the solid phase synthesis vessel was added 50 mL of the potassium-rich phosphate buffer containing 0.03% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM BAL, and 2.6 mM tris-carboxyethylphosphine&#x000b7;HCl. FlAsH-EDT<sub>2</sub> (5 &#x003bc;L) was added as a 1 mM stock solution in DMSO. The vessel was then agitated on a shaker for 6 h.</p><p>After 6 h, the screening solution was drained and the resin was extensively washed. The library was first washed with potassium-rich phosphate buffer containing 0.01% Triton X-100 (v/v) (3 &#x000d7; 30 &#x003bc;L). Then, a phosphate buffer containing 0.03% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM BAL, and 2.5 mM tris-carboxyethylphosphine&#x000b7;HCl was added to the vessel, and the vessel was shaken for 10 h. After 10 h, the solution was drained and the resin was washed extensively with 100 mM potassium bicarbonate buffer (6 &#x000d7; 30 &#x003bc;L) until the odor of thiols from the resin was no longer diminished. Finally, the library was suspended in 200 mL of 100 mM potassium bicarbonate buffer and divided equally into four 90 mm Petri dishes for visualization/bead selection.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.6"><title>Visualization and Isolation of Fluorescent Beads</title><p>Each of the four library fractions 90 mm Petri dish was observed under an 8 W long wave UV lamp, held 10 cm from the beads, using a stereo microscope to identify fluorescent beads. Fluorescent beads were photographed with a Nikon Coolpix E4500 digital camera, top-mounted on the microscope (exposure times between 1 and 8 s were used). A small amount of MeOH was added by pipet to sink floating beads into the focal plane. After being photographed, the fluorescent beads were isolated from the surrounding nonfluorescent beads using the tip of a 200 &#x003bc;L Pipetman. Once the surrounding beads were cleared, the fluorescent bead was drawn into the tip of the 200 &#x003bc;L Pipetman with about 10 &#x003bc;L of the screening solution. In each case, the presence of a single fluorescent bead was confirmed by observing the pipet tip under the long wave UV lamp. The bead was transferred to a Millipore Ultrafree-MC spin tube by placing the bead-loaded tip of the Pipetman near (but not resting on) the bottom of the tube before dispensing the contents. The presence of the fluorescent bead in the spin tube was confirmed under a UV lamp using a stereo microscope.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.7"><title>Preparation and Alkylation of Fluorescent Bead Hits</title><p>These procedures were performed in the manner discussed above, with three exceptions. One, the prewashing of the Millipore Ultrafree-MC spin tube consisted of a water wash (2 &#x000d7; 250 &#x003bc;L), followed by a methanol wash (2 &#x000d7; 250 &#x003bc;L), and finished with a dichloromethane wash (2 &#x000d7; 250 &#x003bc;L). Two, just before adding the CNBr solution, the beads are placed in a drying oven for 5 min, then removed and allowed to cool for an additional 5 min. Third, the CNBr cleavage was shortened to 6.5 h.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to Shirin Sorooshian for her assistance with mass spectrometry.
