Dendritic cells (DC) play a major role in the allo T cell stimulation causing GVHD. Current immunosuppressive measures to control GVHD target T cells but compromise posttransplant immunity in the patient, particularly to cytomegalovirus (CMV) and residual malignant cells. We showed that treatment of allo mixed lymphocyte cultures with activated human DC-depleting CD83 antibody suppressed alloproliferation but preserved T cell numbers, including those specific for CMV. We also tested CD83 antibody in the human T cell&#x02013;dependent peripheral blood mononuclear cell transplanted SCID (hu-SCID) mouse model of GVHD. We showed that this model requires human DC and that CD83 antibody treatment prevented GVHD but, unlike conventional immunosuppressants, did not prevent engraftment of human T cells, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) responsive to viruses and malignant cells. Immunization of CD83 antibody-treated hu-SCID mice with irradiated human leukemic cell lines induced allo antileukemic CTL effectors in vivo that lysed <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled leukemic target cells in vitro without further stimulation. Antibodies that target activated DC are a promising new therapeutic approach to the control of GVHD.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Allogeneic (allo) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an effective therapy for many malignant and nonmalignant hematological and some nonhematological conditions. Conditioning the recipient with radiation and chemotherapy enables donor hematopoietic and immune systems to engraft and provide immune effectors, which confer protective immunity and, for leukemia patients, the desired therapeutic graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect. Donor T cell&#x02013;mediated acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which targets recipient skin, gut, liver, lung, and lymphoid tissue, is an inevitable consequence of alloHSCT and a major cause of morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). GVHD arises within the conditioning-induced inflammatory milieu as donor CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are stimulated to generate alloreactive antihost effector cells. Mouse alloHSCT models indicate that the donor antihost T cell response is stimulated by direct alloantigen presentation by host APC, particularly DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Donor APC also contribute, presumably via the indirect pathway by processing and presenting host antigens to donor T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). That they may be an appropriate therapeutic target in their own right is further supported by recent studies showing that donor APC propagate GVHD initiated by host APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), that they can independently induce GVHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), and that they play a key role in HSCT rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>Prophylactic, and often additional therapeutic immunosuppression, is used to control GVHD but, being nonspecific, this neither spares preexisting donor memory cells nor discriminates between alloreactive and nonalloreactive donor T cells. Thus, although GVHD can be controlled, it is at the cost of increased incidence of graft failure, leukemia relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), and compromised immunity to posttransplant infection, particularly to CMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). GVHD and/or immunosuppression-associated complications prevent the application of alloHSCT to older patients and limit its wider use for the treatment of nonhematopoietic tumors, common nonmalignant conditions (autoimmune disease, thalassemia, and immunodeficiencies), and for gene replacement therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>An alternative strategy that primarily targets DC might prevent GVHD without the complications associated with T cell immunosuppression. Depletion of APC (including DC) in mice with liposomal clodronate reduced development of liver GVHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), and UV radiation to deplete host skin DC prevented mouse skin GVHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). More practical methods aimed at DC are required for clinical therapy. Antibodies can be used to target specific cells and some are available for therapeutic T cell depletion and immunosuppression. However, there are no pan-DC&#x02013;specific antibodies; therefore, it is not currently possible, and possibly not desirable, to specifically deplete all human DC to achieve immunosuppression. However, a proportion of human DC spontaneously up-regulate the DC surface activation markers CD83 and CMRF-44 after overnight culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). These activated DC are the prime stimulators of allo T cell proliferation in vitro and their depletion with antibody specific for CD83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) or CMRF-44 antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) significantly reduces the allo proliferative response, suggesting that such antibodies may have a role in the control of GVHD. We show in this paper that treatment of MLC with anti-human CD83 antibody markedly reduced allo T cell proliferation but preserved preexisting antiviral, particularly anti-CMV effector/memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In contrast, the therapeutic immunosuppressive antibody alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) prevented allo T cell proliferation by depleting virtually all cells including virus-specific T cells.</p><p>To investigate the antihuman CD83 antibody in vivo, we used a chimeric human/mouse model of xenogeneic GVHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) in which SCID mice are engrafted with human PBMC. These hu-SCID mice develop a fatal human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell&#x02013;dependent GVHD-like syndrome affecting multiple organs, which has histological features similar to those seen in allo human and mouse GVHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). We show in this paper that human DC were required to induce GVHD in this model. Treatment of the hu-SCID mice with CD83 antibody prevented GVHD yet allowed human leukocyte engraftment and preserved T cells, including CTL precursors specific for CMV, influenza, and the malignancy-associated antigen Mart1. Moreover, CD83 antibody treatment of hu-SCID mice did not impair in vivo induction of antileukemic cytolytic T cell effectors in response to immunization with human leukemic cell lines.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Anti-CD83 antibody in allo MLC reduces T cell proliferation and IFN-&#x003b3; expression but maintains cell numbers</title><p>Polyclonal rabbit antihuman CD83 (RA83) induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic (ADCC) lysis of activated DC, thereby reducing DC-stimulated allo T cell proliferation in MLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>).

To investigate this, antibody-treated 7-d allo MLCs using CMV<sup>+</sup> HLA-A*0201<sup>+</sup> responder PBMC were tested for the presence of CMV and influenza-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. For each of three donors, approximately similar absolute numbers of CMVpp65-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were recovered from untreated MLCs and those treated with RA83 or negative control antibody (RAneg). Much lower numbers were recovered from alemtuzumab-treated MLCs (0, 1.3, and 7.7% of respective RA83 values for the three donors; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 a</xref>). The same number of total live cells from each MLC were stimulated with CMVpp65 peptide or influenza matrix protein (FMP) peptide and irradiated autologous PBMC and then tested for specific cytotoxic activity.

In our hands, conditioned SCID mice injected i.p. with 50 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> human PBMC reliably developed a fatal GVHD-like syndrome within 8&#x02013;13 d. Histological examination showed periportal lymphocytic infiltration (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070723/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070723/DC1</ext-link>), which is typical of GVHD in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) and in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Mice were killed when an overall GVHD score of 5 was attained, reflecting severe GVHD, at which time human donor cells were detected in spleen, bone marrow, and peritoneal cavity (Fig. S2).</p><p>Mouse APC are weak stimulators of human T cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>); therefore, we considered it likely that APC in the human donor PBMC graft provided the primary stimulation of the human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell GVHD effectors in the hu-SCID model. Supporting this view, purified human T cell (97% CD3<sup>+</sup>) grafts alone induced GVHD in only 30% of SCID mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>). A high incidence of GVHD was fully restored by coadministration of 2.5% human autologous monocyte&#x02013;derived DC with the purified T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>). Thus, human APC are required to induce full GVHD in the hu-SCID model. To explore the role of other human APC besides DC and of other human leukocytes, we depleted PBMC, before transplant, of CD14<sup>+</sup> cells (monocytes), CD19<sup>+</sup> cells (B cells), CD16<sup>+</sup>/CD56<sup>+</sup> cells (NK cells), and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (T cells). None of these depletions significantly affected induction of GVHD (&#x02265;80% of mice achieved a GVHD score of 5 within 13 d; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 b</xref>). This confirmed that human DC are required to stimulate the human antimouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell effectors to induce GVHD and validated the hu-SCID model for evaluating human DC targeted therapy.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Hu-SCID model of GVHD.</bold> (a) Human DC enable full GVHD induction. Administration of purified T cells (97% CD3<sup>+</sup>) alone induced severe GVHD in only 3 out of 10 mice (&#x025a1;; not significantly different from untransplanted controls [&#x025b5;]), but coadministration of 2.5% autologous monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) restored the incidence of severe GVHD (six out of seven mice; &#x025cb;) to PBMC levels (10 out of 10 mice; &#x022c4;, P &#x0003e; 0.05 for MoDC + T cells vs. PBMC).

Our in vitro and in vivo evidence shows that CD83 antibody not only limits the uncontrolled T cell proliferative response that characterizes GVHD but preserves the donor T cell repertoire, in particular, potentially life saving antiviral memory T cells and antileukemic effectors. Current GVHD prophylaxis, be it ex vivo T cell depletion of the graft before transplant or nonspecific immunosuppression, does not spare these vital components of the donor graft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).</p><p>Our in vitro comparison of the polyclonal anti-CD83 antibody (RA83) with the CD52 mAb alemtuzumab provided insight into their mechanisms of immunosuppression. Both antibodies reduced allo T cell proliferation and expression of the TH1 cytokine IFN-&#x003b3;, but alemtuzumab also reduced the TH2 cytokine IL-5 and the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, presumably as a result of its pan-leukocyte&#x02013;depleting capacity. RA83 had little direct effect on T cells, as it did not significantly reduce the number of viable mononuclear cells recovered from the allo MLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 b</xref>), nor did it destroy preexisting CMV-specific nor flu-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>Alloproliferating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell blasts, which were generated during MLC and found in the highest numbers after 96 h, express low levels of CD83 and are also susceptible targets of RA83-mediated ADCC lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) but to a lesser extent than activated CD83<sup>+</sup> DC (4.4-fold less lysis at 10:1 E/T ratio [calculated from data in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>]). Delayed addition of RA83 to the MLC reduced its inhibitory effect on alloproliferation, completely negating its effect, when administered after 96 h to target the alloresponding T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Thus, the functional cellular target of RA83 is present early rather than late during the course of MLC, which is consistent with the principal target being the DC.</p><p>To obtain in vivo evidence for immunosuppressive efficacy of CD83 antibody, we chose a chimeric human/mouse model of GVHD because antibodies specific for human CD83 and CD52 antigens, such as RA83 and alemtuzumab, can be tested. The SCID mouse was used in preference to other immunodeficient strains, despite the requirement for higher donor cell doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), because the hu-SCID model of GVHD has been used more extensively than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), it is complement replete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), and functional human NK cells are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), allowing for antibody-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity and ADCC lysis of human target cells in vivo. The hu-SCID model of GVHD requires human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), but the stimulatory cells had not previously been identified and mouse APC are known to be weak stimulators of human T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). We therefore considered it likely that human DC in the graft would play a major role, and this was supported by finding that purified human T cells required supplementation with human DC to be fully effective at inducing GVHD in conditioned SCID mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 a</xref>).</p><p>Using the hu-SCID model, we found that RA83 prevented GVHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 c</xref>). RA83-treated mice had significantly lower GVHD scores and less weight loss than RAneg-treated or untreated controls when the latter had severe GVHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, a and b</xref>). Circulating levels of human IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-8 were substantially reduced in RA83-treated mice but not IL-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 e</xref>), which is consistent with a GVHD-ameliorative TH2 cytokine milieu predicted by the in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>). RA83 treatment is expected to leave potentially tolerogenic nonactivated (CD83<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) DC intact, and these may induce regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>) with potential allosuppressive benefits. RA83 may also selectively retain TH2 inducing plasmacytoid DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), as they express comparatively low levels of CD83 when activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>Alemtuzumab treatment also prevented GVHD in the hu-SCID model but at the expense of T cell engraftment, particularly CMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 c</xref>). In marked contrast, RA83 treatment prevented GVHD without the loss of specific donor T cell immune memory. Treating transplant patients with CD83 antibody at the time of conditioning should limit the generation of a large pool of alloreactive GVHD inducing effector/memory T cells immediately after transplantation, which, at least in an allo mouse model, can induce GVHD at any time subsequently in the absence of host DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Antibody that targets activated DC, such as that studied here, should also preserve donor T cell immunity to common infections such as CMV, which cause major posttransplant mortality and morbidity. Current immunosuppressants that target T cells, exemplified here by alemtuzumab and ATG, compromise posttransplant immunity, particularly to CMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>) and other infectious agents.</p><p>T cell depletion also compromises the GVL effect and predisposes to recurrence of leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Theoretically, specific depletion of activated DC to control GVHD in clinical alloHSCT should preserve the antileukemia T cell repertoire. Supporting this, from cells recovered from RA83 treated hu-SCID mice, we obtained human effector T cell responses to the naive tumor-associated antigen Mart1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 b</xref>) and to allo human leukemic cell lines, particularly to U937 (AML; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 c</xref>) and Raji (B cell lymphoma; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 d</xref>) cells.</p><p>A potential disadvantage of targeting CD83<sup>+</sup> DC for the prevention of GVHD in alloHSCT patients is that these DC may be required for the induction of GVL effectors from antileukemic precursors, be they T or NK cells. Reddy et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>) showed in a mouse &#x0201c;acute leukemia&#x0201d; model that host and, to a lesser extent, donor DC are required for effective GVL after alloHSCT, although the role of DC activation was not explored. Encouragingly, we found that RA83 did not prevent in vitro induction of allo cytotoxic antileukemic cell line activity by cocultured PBMC (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070723/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070723/DC1</ext-link>). Furthermore, RA83 treatment of hu-SCID mice immunized with the human leukemic cell lines U937 and Raji did not impair in vivo induction of antileukemic cytotoxic T cell effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig.7</xref>). Nevertheless, if GVL proves to be compromised by peritransplant DC-targeted treatment, it could be managed by subsequent vaccination with leukemia antigen-loaded donor DC or by donor leukocyte infusions, perhaps boosted by donor vaccination before transplantation. Alternatively, to retain peritransplant antileukemia priming by host CD83<sup>+</sup> DC, antibody treatment might await the appearance, after transplant, of activated DC in the circulation, an event which precedes clinical GVHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>).</p><p>Any significant improvement in the control of GVHD as a result of targeting DC may allow wider utilization of alloHSCT for malignant conditions and for nonmalignant conditions, which do not require GVL. Our data provides compelling evidence that depletion of activated human DC is a promising alternative GVHD prevention strategy that warrants further investigation. A DC targeted therapy, which prevents alloreactive GVHD-inducing T cell generation, even allowing immature DC-mediated tolerance induction, which nonetheless, still preserves protective and therapeutic T cells, would also have wider applications in allotransplantation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Antibodies.</title><p>Rabbit polyclonal IgG anti&#x02013;human CD83 (RA83) was prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>) but with an added CD83 antigen affinity purification step (see Supplementary Materials and methods [available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070723/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070723/DC1</ext-link>] for preparation and validation).
