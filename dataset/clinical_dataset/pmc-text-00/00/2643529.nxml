How the applied force propagates within proteins determines their mechanical behavior yet remains largely unknown. We present a new method based on molecular dynamics simulations to disclose the distribution of strain in protein structures, here for the newly determined high-resolution crystal structure of I27, a titin immunoglobulin (IG) domain. We obtain a sparse, spatially connected, and highly anisotropic mechanical network. This allows us to detect load-bearing motifs composed of interstrand hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic core interactions, including parts distal to the site to which force was applied. The role of the force distribution pattern for mechanical stability is tested by <italic>in silico</italic> unfolding of I27 mutants. We then compare the observed force pattern to the sparse network of coevolved residues found in this family. We find a remarkable overlap, suggesting the force distribution to reflect constraints for the evolutionary design of mechanical resistance in the IG family. The force distribution analysis provides a molecular interpretation of coevolution and opens the road to the study of the mechanism of signal propagation in proteins in general.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Many biological processes such as cell proliferation and signaling are guided by mechanical stress. Proteins as the molecular machinery behind these processes are reacting to or withstanding mechanical forces in specific ways. How mechanical stress propagates through proteins to induce a certain mechanical response is currently unknown. We here present a new method that detects force distribution in proteins, reminiscent of computational approaches used to engineer macroscopic structures. The method is based on molecular dynamics simulations during which we calculate changes in interatomic forces, here caused by pulling the protein. We apply this method to the extremely robust immunoglobulin domain of the muscle protein titin and obtain the mechanical network of stress-bearing elements spanning the protein scaffold. Mutations in this region were shown to result in a significant loss of mechanical stability. We then ask how the remarkable mechanical stability has been designed during evolution. To this end, we compare the force distribution network with a network of coevolved residues found in the immunoglobulin family. Both networks show a remarkable overlap, thereby suggesting that the observed stress propagation pattern reflects constraints used during evolution to render this protein mechanically robust.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular functions such as growth, motility, and signaling are tightly coupled with mechanical forces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000306-Bustamante1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000306-Johnson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

These data provide important insight into the load-bearing structural motifs of IG. A more fundamental question is how mechanical load distributes through a protein. It is an obvious assumption that force propagates through the structure to parts which, being distant from the application site of the perturbation, cannot be straightforwardly inferred from unfolding forces. Currently, there is no direct way at hand to explain the frequent experimental observation of site specific changes in dynamics (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000306-Clarkson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>). In this study we present a new method to detect the mechanical network sustaining load within a protein from molecular dynamics simulations. We apply the force distribution analysis to I27, an IG domain of the muscle protein titin and one of the most robust protein domains known. The atomic resolution force distribution analysis relies on an accurate three dimensional picture of atomic interactions. We have determined the first high-resolution crystal structure of I27, a cornerstone for the interpretation of force spectroscopy experiments and crucial for our analysis.</p><p>The sparse mechanical network spanning the I27 structure is reminiscent of the molecular networks revealed by statistical coupling analysis on multiple sequence alignments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000306-Lockless1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000306-Sel1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

A direct relation of coevolution with molecular behavior, however, remains to be found. We compare the obtained pattern of force propagation with a network of coevolved residues found in the IG domain family, and find strongly coevolved residues to play a dominant role in force distribution. We therefore suggest internal strain propagation to present a first microscopic interpretation of a coevolved network in a protein with mechanical function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overall Structure of I27</title><p>The crystal structure of wild-type human cardiac muscle I27 (residues 5253&#x02013;5341, renumbered to 1&#x02013;89 for simplicity) has been solved to 1.8&#x000c5; by molecular replacement, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000306-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. There are six I27 molecules in the asymmetric unit arranged around the local non-crystallographic 6-fold axis, with the N-termini of I27 closest to the local axis and the C-termini pointing outward. The entire amino acid sequence from residue 1&#x02013;89 is visible in electron density (except L89 in chain E), as well as an additional 3&#x02013;4 residues left from the TEV cleavage site after the N-terminal H6-tag (-AMA- in chain A; none in chain B; and -GAMA- in chains C&#x02013;F, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The crystal structure reveals the well-known IG-like fold of the titin I-band IG domains and closely resembles the structure of the average NMR ensemble published earlier (PDB code 1TIT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000306-Improta1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>); with 1.23&#x000c5; root mean square distance (RMSD) between C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> carbons from all superposed residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000306.s003">Figure S1</xref>). The largest distance (3.66&#x000c5; for G53) is explained by the presence of a drastically different turn conformation between strands D and E, removing this turn (residues 52&#x02013;55) reduces global RMSD to 1.05&#x000c5;. As a comparison, the RMSD between non-crystallographic symmetry-related chains in the I27 crystal structure ranges from 0.16&#x02013;0.35&#x000c5;. Residues involved in the H-bond pairing across the A'G strand have RMSD between 0.6&#x02013;1.4&#x000c5; (res. 11&#x02013;16) and 0.5&#x02013;1.5&#x000c5; (res. 78&#x02013;87).

While the hydrogen bonding between the A' and G strand largely overlaps, the interaction between Y9-N83 is absent but E12-K87 are within interaction distance, the latter supposedly adding resistance. Of the two residues mutated in the NMR structure, T78 (first residue of strand G) makes a side chain H-bond interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of L2 (preceding strand A) which is absent in the NMR structure and which could potentially add further mechanical resistance to I27. The implications of the differences observed between the interaction networks of both I27 structures for atomic force microscopy (AFM) and molecular dynamics studies are obvious, since site-directed mutagenesis of the residues involved in those interactions has been used as a tool to discern the mechanical properties of I27.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Force Distribution</title><p>To elucidate distribution of mechanical stress in the titin I27 domain, we directly calculate forces <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000306.e001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> between each pair of atoms <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> during MD simulations of the high-resolution crystal structure of I27 described above.

We here are interested in the force propagation within the fully folded protein, the physiologically relevant force-bearing structure.

Remarkably, the mechanical network is sparse in the sense that large parts of the protein including strands C, D, E and F are not part of the network and thus apparently play no direct role in mechanical stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000306-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-1000306-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000306.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Force distribution in I27.</title><p>(A) Graph representation of changes in interatomic forces, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000306.e004.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, observed upon mechanical perturbation of I27.

Mechanical load at the C-terminus is mainly taken up by main-chain interactions around the A'G strand, whereas at the N-terminal side forces are primarily propagating into the protein core by side chain interactions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000306.g002"/></fig><p>The pattern is found to be highly anisotropic, with the terminal strands passing the tension along the strands adjacent to the force application sites and partially into the protein core through a connected network of mainly hydrophobic interactions spanning between I2, V4, N77, I23, L25, V30, W34, H56, F73 and T78 from the N-terminal side and V11, A19, F21, L60, M67, and L84 from the C-terminal side. We observe very different mechanisms of force distribution for the A'G and AB strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000306-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The A'G strand, known to be crucial for mechanical resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000306-Marszalek1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, forms a mechanical clamp. Under load it shows a strong increase in interstrand H-bond (blue) and side chain forces (red). This is accompanied by a stiffening of the strand and neighboring residues as reflected by decreased root mean square fluctuations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000306.s004">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, the AB strand, even though it has been shown to be the first point of rupture of the IG fold, does not show any major contribution to mechanical stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000306-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), in agreement with experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000306-Best1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Instead, force applied at the N-terminus is directly deflected into the protein core via mainly hydrophobic side chain interactions (red edges) between strands A and G, bypassing the AB interstrand hydrogen bonds, what again involves stiffening (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000306.s004">Figure S2</xref>). This illustrates that rupture points are not necessarily involved in taking up large conformational load.

A number of structural features, such as the A'G interstrand hydrogen bonds or the interactions involving T78, which was absent in the NMR structure due to the T78A mutation, are part of the force-bearing network. The determination of a refined crystal structure thus served as an important basis for our force distribution analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Comparison of the Mechanical with the Evolutionary Network in IG Domains</title><p>Sparse networks which span protein molecular structures in a spatially connected and anisotropic way have been previously observed for evolutionary couplings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000306-Lockless1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000306-Sel1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

SCA assigns a &#x0201c;statistical coupling energy&#x0201d; &#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>E</italic> to each position in a multiple sequence alignment. &#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>E</italic> is determined upon perturbation by removal of sequences of the alignment that changes the amino acid distribution at a specific position. If the observed amino acid distribution at position <italic>b</italic> changes with respect to perturbation at position <italic>a</italic>, these positions are &#x0201c;coupled&#x0201d;. Intuitively, if evolution changed residue <italic>a</italic> it is also likely to change residue <italic>b</italic> to maintain the protein's functionality, i.e., <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are statistically dependent throughout evolution. We perform a set of small perturbations to the MSA by removing one row at a time. Each perturbation results in a small fluctuation of &#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>E</italic> values for each position. The matrix containing perturbations versus &#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>E</italic> fluctuations is referred to as perturbation matrix, and PCA was done on this matrix. We then define the coupling score between two positions as the cross product of the two &#x00394;&#x00394;<italic>E</italic> trajectories, which is the norm of the two position vectors in perturbation space.</p><p>We perform SCA on two sets of sequences. The first, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000306.e049.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, contains the sequences of all 152 IG domains in human muscle titin (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Q8WZ42). The second more general alignment <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000306.e050.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> was chosen from the IG I-set (Pfam id: PF07679) family by similarity to I27 and contains 282 sequences. Hereto a Blast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000306-Altschul1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> search against all sequences from the I-set family was done and sequences with e-score &#x0003c;1.00 were selected. All sequences with similarity &#x0003e;90&#x00025; to any other sequence were removed. SCA requires the set of sequences to be sufficiently diverse. Further the set of sequences should be well balanced, in the sense that the average similarity to all other sequences should be roughly the same for each sequence. We checked the diversity of sequences within the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000306.e051.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> alignments and found it to be comparable to results published earlier.
