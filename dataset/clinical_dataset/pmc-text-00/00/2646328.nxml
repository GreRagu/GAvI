Patients with severe sepsis on renal replacement therapy (RRT), who typically receive additional anticoagulation to prevent circuit clotting, may be at higher risk of bleeding when DrotAA is administered in addition to standard anticoagulation. However, the effects of DrotAA on filter duration in the absence of additional anticoagulation have not been established. The aim of this study was to analyse the filter survival time (FST), and to quantify the requirement of packed red cells (PRC) and blood products during DrotAA infusion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a single-centre, retrospective observational study conducted in an adult intensive care unit (ICU). Thirty-five patients with severe sepsis who had received both RRT and DrotAA were identified, and all relevant clinical and laboratory data were retrieved from the departmental electronic patient record. We compared haemofilter parameters, requirement of blood products and haemodynamic data recorded during RRT and the infusion of DrotAA with those recorded on RRT with standard anticoagulation after the DrotAA infusion had been completed (post-DrotAA).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The proportion of filter changes due to filter clotting was similar during DrotAA infusion and with conventional anticoagulation post-DrotAA infusion. There was no difference in the FST and filter parameters during DrotAA in the presence or absence of additional anticoagulation with heparin or epoprostenol. A similar proportion of patients required red cell transfusion, although a greater proportion of patients received platelet and fresh frozen plasma during DrotAA infusion compared with the post-DrotAA period with no difference between medical and surgical patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Additional anticoagulation during DrotAA infusion does not appear to improve FST. The use of DrotAA in patients with severe sepsis requiring RRT is safe and is not associated with an increased need for PRC transfusion or major bleeding events.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta><notes><p>See related commentary by de Pont and Schultz, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ccforum.com/content/13/1/113"/></p></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA; Xigris, Eli Lilly &#x00026; Co., Indianapolis, USA), a recombinant human activated protein C, can reduce mortality in patients with severe sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Data from long-term follow-up studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and from international and national registries have also confirmed that the effects of DrotAA on survival seen in clinical practice are consistent with those seen in randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, despite the beneficial outcome data and acceptable safety profile, intensivists are often reluctant to prescribe DrotAA in certain groups of patients (e.g., patients who have undergone surgery, patients with coagulopathy or those who receive anticoagulants) because the anticoagulant properties of DrotAA might increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the presence of clotting abnormalities associated with sepsis.</p><p>Anticoagulants are generally given to patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) to prolong the duration of the filter and to prevent damage and loss of platelets and erythrocytes in the clotted circuit. However, the risk of bleeding and the lifespan of the RRT circuit in patients who continue anticoagulation while receiving DrotAA compared with patients who receive DrotAA alone is not known. Therefore, the two main issues concerning the use of DrotAA during RRT are: the safety of DrotAA in renal failure requiring RRT; and the need for additional anticoagulation to preserve filter function and prolong filter survival.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that DrotAA is not eliminated by haemofiltration or dialysis, and its serum concentration and drug half-life are similar in patients with or without renal failure; therefore, no dose adjustment is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, no specific data are available on the safety of DrotAA, duration of the RRT circuit survival, bleeding events leading to red cell transfusion or blood products for the correction of clotting abnormalities during RRT in septic patients who receive DrotAA.</p><p>The aims of our study were: to analyse the filter survival time (FST) during DrotAA infusion &#x02013; in the presence or absence of additional anticoagulation compared with the 96 hours post-DrotAA infusion &#x02013; with standard anticoagulation, while still on RRT; and to quantify the use of packed red cell (PRC) and blood products in patients with acute kidney injury requiring RRT treated with DrotAA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>This was a retrospective, single-centre study of patients with severe sepsis admitted to the adult intensive care unit (ICU) at St Thomas' Hospital in London, UK.

Similarly, there was a difference in the number of patients receiving fresh frozen plasma during DrotAA (17% versus 8%), with a median (IQR) of fresh frozen plasma transfused of 1566 (574 to 1884) mL versus 819 (807 to 955) mL in the post-DrotAA period (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>).

In our institution, clinicians made decisions about anticoagulation in these patients according to experience and after taking into account the platelet count, clotting times and filter parameters. This is reflected in the variety of anticoagulation regimens used in our dataset.</p><p>Our data suggest that additional anticoagulation during DrotAA infusion does not improve filter survival time. Also, the lifespan of the circuit during DrotAA is similar to that seen in the presence or absence of additional anticoagulation while on DrotAA and with standard anticoagulation in the 96 hours immediately after DrotAA therapy. Therefore, there is probably no need for routine additional anticoagulation to preserve circuit function and this became our practice after 2006.</p><p>The data also suggest that the use of DrotAA in patients with severe sepsis requiring RRT appears safe and is not associated with an increased need for PRC transfusion or important bleeding events.</p><p>During the DrotAA infusion, there was a greater, albeit not statistically significant, volume of platelets and fresh frozen plasma transfused compared with the post-DrotAA period. It is difficult to understand whether this difference can be entirely attributed to DrotAA, or whether it is multi-factorial. Other possible explanations include variable thresholds among clinicians to correct the commonly observed increased clotting times induced by DrotAA, or attempts to correct a bleeding event or a sepsis-induced coagulopathy.</p><p>There is minimal data on how to manage anticoagulation in patients on RRT during the infusion DrotAA therapy and in clinical practice the choice of RRT modalities and anticoagulation is dependent on expert opinion, and the clinician's level of experience with both treatments. Our data shows that DrotAA is as effective as heparin in terms of FST, and these data are in accordance with a previous report on three patients receiving DrotAA while on RRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Several small studies have also confirmed that in patients at high risk of bleeding and with some degree of coagulopathy, RRT in the absence of anticoagulation does not result in a shorter circuit survival time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, the presence of sepsis-induced coagulopathy and the effects of DrotAA on the APTT make the monitoring of anticoagulation unreliable and can increase the risk of inappropriate anticoagulation. Knowledge of the effect of DrotAA on FST is also important in the presence of thrombocytopenia, which may caution the concomitant use of heparin. Anticoagulation can be recommenced, as per standard practice, when the infusion of DrotAA has been completed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In this study we found that our FSTs were generally short (less than 24 hours). This duration was not solely attributable to filter clotting, but it was often (60.7% of circuit changes during DrotAA and 63.6% post-DrotAA) due to investigations (e.g., computed tomography scan) or a surgical procedure.</p><p>Although our study shows that no additional anticoagulation is necessary for filter survival, it is now probably advisable to continue treatment with prophylactic heparin in all patients who were already receiving it before RRT, as suggested by the Xigris and PRophylactic hEparin in Severe Sepsis (XPRESS) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The decision to use heparin should be taken independently from the decision to use DrotAA and should take into consideration the bleeding risk of each individual patient.</p><p>Our study has the limitation of being a retrospective analysis in a small number of patients; however, this is an area of practice that is clinically important and in which it is difficult for individual clinicians working in smaller centres to gain sufficient experience. Another potential confounder is that during the two periods of time the patients are clearly at different stages of evolution of the sepsis episode. One therefore might expect different patterns of coagulation activity between the two groups. Even so, given these important caveats, it is valuable to be able to show that anticoagulation for RRT can be carried out safely with DrotAA alone and that additional anticoagulation is not routinely necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Additional anticoagulation in patients receiving RRT during DrotAA infusion is not routinely necessary and does not improve FST. The use of DrotAA in patients with severe sepsis requiring RRT is safe and is not associated with an increased need for PRC transfusion. Interpretation of the effects of DrotAA on platelet and fresh frozen plasma transfusion are confounded by the presence of sepsis-induced coagulopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x02022; Additional anticoagulation in patients receiving RRT during DrotAA infusion is not routinely necessary and does not improve FST.</p><p>&#x02022; The use of DrotAA in patients with severe sepsis requiring RRT is safe and is not associated with an increased need for PRC transfusion.</p><p>&#x02022; Interpretation of the effects of DrotAA on platelet and fresh frozen plasma transfusion requirements are confounded by the presence sepsis-induced coagulopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>APTT: activated partial thromboplastin time; DrotAA: Drotrecogin alfa (activated); FST: filter survival time; ICU: intensive care unit; INR: international normalized ratio; IQR: interquartile range; PRC: packed red cells; RRT: renal replacement therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>DW has received lecture fees from Eli Lilly and Company (the manufacturer of drotrecogin alfa) and has acted as a consultant to Eli Lilly and Company over the past six years.
