Although HIV-related proteins including gp120 and Tat can directly cause oxidant stress and cellular dysfunction, their effects in the lung are unknown.

Oxidant stress in the alveolar space was determined by measuring the glutathione redox couple by high performance liquid chromatography, and the expression and membrane localization of key tight junction proteins were assessed.

Despite the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), lung disease continues to be the leading cause of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Interestingly, although infections account for the apparent majority of these lung-related deaths, there is growing evidence that HIV also increases the risk of chronic airway diseases such as emphysema. For example, an analysis of the Veterans Aging Cohort Study showed that HIV-infected subjects were 50&#x02013;60% more likely to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis) than HIV-negative subjects, and that HIV infection was an independent risk factor even after accounting for age, race/ethnicity, smoking histories, and substance abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Other studies show similar results and several recent excellent reviews summarize the clinical data to date as well as some of the laboratory-based research that is beginning to explore possible mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A common target in both acute lung injuries such as pneumonia and chronic lung diseases such as emphysema is alveolar epithelial damage. However, whether or not chronic HIV infection renders the alveolar epithelium susceptible to injury is unknown.</p><p>There is abundant evidence that oxidant stress is associated with a wide range of lung diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Within the alveolar space, the thiol antioxidant glutathione (GSH) plays a key role in detoxifying endogenous and exogenous oxidants and limits the oxidation of cysteine residues in many proteins, thereby regulating redox signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The preservation of an adequate GSH pool within the alveolar space is therefore critical to control cell signaling, the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, cell proliferation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Unfortunately, HIV infection is associated with significant oxidant stress and decreased systemic levels of GSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Within the lung, there is evidence that GSH levels decline as the disease progresses, whereas the lungs of asymptomatic individuals have preserved levels of GSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Importantly, not all of the consequences of HIV infection can be attributed solely to direct viral infection. It has been reported that HIV-related proteins released by infected cells can enter the central nervous system (CNS) from the blood and affect CNS function independently of viral transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For example, the HIV envelope protein, gp120, and the transregulatory protein Tat, can stimulate endothelial cells to secrete neuro-immunoactive substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is interesting to note that gp120 and Tat can directly induce oxidant stress and GSH depletion in isolated endothelial cells, and this appears to contribute to tight junction disruption and compromise of the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although the mechanisms by which these HIV-related proteins cause oxidant stress are not completely understood, it has been shown that Tat can repress the expression of the mitochondrial form of superoxide dismutase in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Whether this repression of superoxide dismutase or some other oxidant stress induced by these proteins decreases the intracellular GSH pool is unclear. Transgenic animal studies extend such <italic>in vitro </italic>studies and provide perhaps the most compelling evidence implicating HIV-related proteins in the pathophysiology of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Reid and colleagues established a non-infectious HIV-1 transgenic (HIV-1 Tg) rat model that expresses an HIV-1 provirus regulated by the viral promoter but with a functional deletion of <italic>gag and pol </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This HIV-1 Tg rat develops a progressive AIDS-like phenotype as it ages including immunologic dysfunction, nephropathy, muscle wasting, skin lesions and cataracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We recently reported that these HIV-1 transgenic rats have soluble gp120 in their alveolar epithelial lining fluid and have significant defects in alveolar macrophage immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These findings were provocative as they suggest that the well-known effects of HIV infection on this resident immune cell within the alveolar space may not be entirely due to viral infection and replication <italic>per se</italic>, but that HIV-related proteins could exert pathophysiological effects within this microenvironment. Further, although the effects of HIV infection on alveolar macrophage function have been studied extensively, very little attention has focused on possible effects on the alveolar epithelium as this cell type is not infected by the virus. However, as HIV-related proteins are present in the alveolar space during chronic infection and have toxic effects on other cell types that are likewise not infected directly by the virus, and because HIV-infected individuals are also susceptible to diseases associated with alveolar epithelial dysfunction, we investigated the effects of HIV-1 transgene expression on alveolar epithelial function in the rat model. In this study, we report that chronic expression of HIV-related proteins <italic>in vivo </italic>causes profound oxidant stress and GSH depletion in the lung. In parallel, these HIV-related proteins cause significant alveolar epithelial barrier dysfunction that is associated with changes in tight junction proteins that can be reproduced in primary alveolar epithelial cells <italic>in vitro </italic>by direct exposure to gp120 and Tat. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that HIV-related proteins affect alveolar epithelial barrier function and could thereby render infected individuals susceptible to acute or chronic causes of respiratory failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>HIV-1 transgene expression caused significant oxidant stress in the lung</title><p>We first determined the relative levels of glutathione (GSH) and its primary oxidized form, glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in the lung lavage fluids of wild type (WT) and HIV-1 transgenic (HIV-1 Tg) rats. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, panel A, GSH levels were decreased &#x0003e;90% (P = 0.0016) in HIV-1 Tg rats compared to WT rats. In parallel, there was evidence of significant GSH oxidation; specifically, and as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, panel B, the relative levels of glutathione disulfide (GSSG; the predominant form of oxidized glutathione) to GSH, expressed as the GSSG:GSH ratio (a commonly used index of oxidant stress), were increased nearly 3-fold (P = 0.0049) in HIV-1 Tg rats compared to WT rats. Further evidence of oxidant stress in the lungs of HIV-1 Tg rats is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Lung tissue levels of hydrogen peroxide were significantly increased (P &#x0003c; 0.0001) in HIV-1 Tg rats compared to WT rats. In contrast, despite the oxidant stress within the alveolar space of HIV-1 transgenic rats, there was no evidence of significant inflammation. Specifically, the cell counts and differentials were not different (P &#x0003e; 0.05) in the lung lavage fluids of HIV-1 transgenic rats when compared to wild type rats (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; shown are the mean values &#x000b1; SEM of 4 rats in each group; for the differential counts, an average of 525 cells per lavage fluid sample were analyzed. In parallel, the levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) were the same (P &#x0003e; 0.05) in the lung lavage fluids of HIV-1 transgenic rats when compared to wild type rats (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>; shown are the mean values &#x000b1; SEM of 4 rats in each group; note the trend toward an increase in IL-2 in the HIV-1 transgenic rats but with significant variation in the levels of this cytokine). Although these latter results do not exclude perturbations in the control of inflammation within the alveolar space, they nevertheless suggest that chronic expression of HIV-1-related proteins causes significant oxidant stress but this is not accompanied by overt chronic inflammation. This is consistent with our previous findings that HIV-1 transgenic expression dampens the immune functions of the resident alveolar macrophage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These findings are also consistent with the effects of chronic alcohol ingestion on the lung, which causes significant glutathione depletion within the alveolar space but does not by itself cause overt lung inflammation or injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of total cells and differential cell counts from rat BAL between wild type and HIV-1 transgenic rats.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" colspan="5"><bold>Cell type</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Group</italic></bold></td><td align="center">Total cells (&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>)</td><td align="center">Macrophages (%)</td><td align="center">Lymphocytes (%)</td><td align="center">Neutrophils (%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>Wild Type</italic></bold></td><td align="center">1.96 &#x000b1; 0.2</td><td align="center">97.92 &#x000b1; 0.7</td><td align="center">1.61 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center">0.47 &#x000b1; 0.2</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>HIV-1 Tg</italic></bold></td><td align="center">2.36 &#x000b1; 0.1</td><td align="center">97.27 &#x000b1; 0.2</td><td align="center">1.90 &#x000b1; 0.2</td><td align="center">0.82 &#x000b1; 0.2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from BAL in wild type and HIV-1 transgenic rats.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center"><bold>Wild Type</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>HIV-1 Tg</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">IL-2 (pg/ml)</td><td align="center">20.2 &#x000b1; 10.8</td><td align="center">98.5 &#x000b1; 58.9</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">TNF&#x003b1; (pg/ml)</td><td align="center">0.5 &#x000b1; 0.2</td><td align="center">1.1 &#x000b1; 0.3</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">IL-4 (pg/ml)</td><td align="center">4.4 &#x000b1; 1.1</td><td align="center">6.4 &#x000b1; 1.2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>HIV-1 transgene expression decreased glutathione levels and altered the glutathione redox balance in the alveolar space</bold>.

This technique provides a sensitive index of overall lung epithelial barrier function, which is the integration of active fluid transport and paracellular permeability. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panel A, wet:dry ratios in HIV-1 Tg rats following saline challenge were increased ~2-fold higher above baseline than comparably challenged WT rats (P &#x0003c; 0.05), reflecting a significantly decreased ability to clear saline from the lung. Note that the baseline wet:dry ratio of the rat lung is 4.7 as we have published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and therefore the data are plotted to reflect the relative increases from this baseline in each group. As decreased lung liquid clearance can reflect either an increase in epithelial paracellular permeability or a decrease in transcellular fluid transport, we next determined alveolar epithelial paracellular permeability <italic>in vitro</italic>. We have used and published this combination of lung liquid clearance <italic>in vivo </italic>and alveolar epithelial paracellular permeability <italic>in vitro </italic>to examine the effects of chronic alcohol ingestion on the alveolar epithelial barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

Therefore, the defect in lung liquid clearance shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panel A appears to be due at least in part to a relative increase in alveolar epithelial permeability induced by HIV-1 transgene expression. Importantly, these effects on the alveolar epithelial barrier could not be explained by transgene expression of HIV-related proteins within the alveolar epithelium <italic>per se</italic>, as gp120 expression was not detected in these cells by ELISA (not shown), even though gp120 protein was easily detectable in even dilute lung lavage fluid in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

Although this short-term exposure did not reproduce the entire pattern of ZO-1 and occludin protein expression seen in monolayers from HIV-1 Tg rats, Tat treatment decreased (P &#x0003c; 0.05) both ZO-1 and occludin protein levels in the membrane/cytoskeleton (Triton X-100 insoluble) fraction when compared to no treatment (control) as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panel B (* P &#x0003c; 0.05 compared to control in each condition). In parallel, immunocytochemical analyses revealed changes in occludin and ZO-1 staining in the plasma membranes of gp120- and Tat-treated monolayers that were similar to those seen in monolayers from HIV-1 Tg rats shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>. Specifically, as shown in the representative images in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> (panel C shows staining for ZO-1 and panel D shows staining for occludin), treatment with either gp120 or Tat caused some discontinuous staining within the plasma membranes and appeared to increase the amount of punctate staining within the cytosol.

Therefore, even short-term treatment of na&#x000ef;ve alveolar epithelial monolayers with gp120 or Tat <italic>in vitro </italic>produced changes in the expression of ZO-1 and occludin that were consistent with what was observed in the alveolar epithelium of rats that expressed these proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Treatment of alveolar epithelial monolayers from wild type rats with either gp120 or Tat for 24 hrs altered expression of occludin and ZO-1</bold>.

Specifically, the pool of glutathione within the alveolar space of HIV-1 Tg rats was decreased &#x0003e;90%, with a concomitant increase in the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione, as well as an increase in tissue levels of hydrogen peroxide. However, despite this significant oxidant stress there was no overt evidence of lung inflammation as reflected by the absence of neutrophil or lymphocyte infiltration of the airways and no change in the levels of several key cytokines. In parallel with the oxidant stress the alveolar epithelial barrier was impaired, with decreased lung liquid clearance <italic>in vivo </italic>that correlated with increased paracellular permeability of alveolar epithelial monolayers <italic>in vitro</italic>. Finally, the expression and membrane localization of two key tight junction proteins, ZO-1 and occludin, were decreased within the alveolar epithelium of HIV-1 Tg rats, consistent with previous findings that Tat alters ZO-1 expression in the blood-brain barrier via redox-sensitive signaling mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Finally, these effects on ZO-1 and occludin expression could be largely reproduced by treating na&#x000ef;ve alveolar epithelial monolayers with gp120 or Tat protein directly <italic>in vitro</italic>. Taken together, these results indicate that HIV-related proteins produce oxidant stress and previously unrecognized barrier dysfunction within the alveolar epithelium, effects that resemble toxicities that have been described in other tissues such as the endothelium of the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Further, these results suggest a novel mechanism by which HIV infection might render individuals susceptible to acute and chronic forms of respiratory failure. For example, an impaired alveolar epithelial barrier would increase lung edema and worsen gas exchange during acute pneumonia, and could potentially increase the susceptibility to chronic damage from smoking and promote the development of emphysema. When these effects on the alveolar epithelium are coupled with the immune suppression of alveolar macrophages that we recently described in this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the experimental evidence argues that chronic exposure of the alveolar epithelium to HIV-related proteins <italic>in vivo </italic>could contribute to the increased risk of acute and chronic lung disease in HIV-infected individuals.</p><p>Many lung disorders are associated with oxidant stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and it is not surprising that HIV infection has long been recognized to cause systemic and pulmonary oxidant stress, including significant lowering of glutathione levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our findings in this study provide compelling evidence that HIV-related proteins exert oxidant stress within the alveolar space independently of active viral replication. Further, as the levels of glutathione were decreased by ~90% in the lung lavage fluid (which largely reflects the alveolar epithelial lining fluid), these results suggest that the alveolar compartment is particularly vulnerable to oxidant damage during HIV infection. The investigation of the mechanisms by which these HIV-related proteins induce oxidant stress within the alveolar space was beyond the scope of this initial study. Whether or not putative mechanisms that have been implicated with individual HIV-related proteins such as gp120 or Tat in cell culture studies <italic>in vitro </italic>are involved in the alveolar space <italic>in vivo </italic>is at present unknown. However, these findings suggest the possibility that therapeutic strategies designed to augment glutathione pools within the airway could mitigate the effects of chronic HIV infection.</p><p>The potential for complementing current HAART strategies with antioxidant supplements is further supported by emerging evidence that the oxidant stress caused by chronic HIV infection could be exacerbated by other factors such as alcohol abuse, which is a common co-morbid condition in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our group has used both animal models and clinical studies to demonstrate that chronic alcohol abuse also causes oxidant stress within the alveolar space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], as well as alveolar epithelial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and macrophage defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] that are remarkably similar to what we have identified in the HIV-1 transgenic rat model, including altered expression and membrane localization of tight junction proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Therefore, chronic alcohol ingestion could exacerbate HIV-mediated oxidant stress as well as epithelial and endothelial barrier dysfunction, and could thereby account for the poorer outcomes in these individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It can be difficult to extrapolate from animal models and separate association from causation in complex human diseases, and to date the evidence supporting the clinical use of anti-oxidants as a treatment for a specific lung disease is lacking. However, the combination of HIV infection and chronic alcohol abuse may represent a uniquely vulnerable population that could respond to dietary supplements with glutathione precursors, such as S-adenosylmethionine. In addition, we recently determined that HIV-1 transgene expression impairs zinc homeostasis within the alveolar space, and that dietary zinc supplementation improves alveolar macrophage immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>There are limitations in this initial study. We did not examine other potential contributors to the oxidant stress such as alterations in nitric oxide balance ("nitrosative stress"). In addition, our evaluation of potential dysregulation of inflammation within the alveolar space was restricted to quantification of inflammatory cells and three key cytokines; although we found no gross evidence of inflammation in the airways of HIV-1 transgenic rats, we clearly did not exclude important changes such as alterations in lymphocyte subsets or other perturbations. In light of the significant dampening of alveolar macrophage immune function that we previously identified in this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], one might expect to see impaired recruitment of neutrophils and/or appropriate lymphocyte subsets during stresses such as pneumonia. Another important limitation of this study is that at present we cannot conclude that the effects of chronic exposure to HIV-1-related proteins in the rat lung mirror the effects in the lungs of HIV-infected humans. Importantly, whether or not human or non-human cells are used to study the effects of these proteins on cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, it remains problematic to extend such findings to the clinical setting. Therefore, our findings in this transgenic rat model can serve as a guide in designing clinical studies but must be confirmed in the human context. Although these experimental findings need to be translated to the clinical setting, it is compelling to consider that glutathione precursors and zinc could be adjunctive therapies in the chronic treatment regimens for HIV infection. Such strategies could be applied fairly easily to determine if the alveolar macrophage dysfunction we identified in this experimental model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] does indeed translate to the clinical setting. For example, if dietary zinc and/or glutathione supplements improved alveolar macrophage function in otherwise healthy HIV-infected individuals (it is not feasible to obtain sufficient quantities of alveolar epithelial cells), this would provide additional validation of the transgenic rat model and more importantly would provide the rationale for a multi-center interventional trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we report that HIV-1 transgene expression causes previously unrecognized oxidant stress within the alveolar space, and that this oxidant stress is associated with changes in tight junction protein expression and barrier dysfunction in the alveolar epithelium even in the absence of any obvious airway inflammation. Although previous studies have determined that HIV-related proteins induce oxidant stress and disrupt the blood-brain endothelial barrier with significant consequences to the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], to our knowledge there are no studies to date that demonstrate comparable toxicities within the alveolar epithelium. These findings are provocative in that they suggest a novel mechanism by which HIV infection renders individuals susceptible to acute and chronic forms of lung injury, and in particular could help explain how HIV infection increases the risk of putatively non-infectious lung diseases such as emphysema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Finally, this study and recent work from our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] suggest that HIV-1 transgenic rodent models offer unique opportunities to determine the pathological effects of HIV-related proteins independently of viral infection and/or replication, and provide powerful tools to perform pre-clinical assessment of complementary therapies such as glutathione and/or zinc supplementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male HIV-1 transgenic Fischer 344 rats and Fischer 344 wild type rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, Indiana) and bred in the animal facility at the Atlanta VA under a 12:12 light-dark cycle.
