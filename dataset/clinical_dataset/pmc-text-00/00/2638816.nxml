These attentional signals are weaker than the feature-selective responses, and their reliability may therefore be limited by the noisiness of neuronal responses. Here we show that it is possible to decode the locus of attention on a single trial from the activity of a small population of neurons in area V1. Previous studies suggested that correlations between the activities of neurons that are part of a population limit the information gain, but here we report that the impact of these noise correlations depends on the relative position of the neurons' receptive fields. Correlations reduce the benefit of pooling neuronal responses evoked by the same object but actually enhance the advantage of pooling responses evoked by different objects. These opposing effects cancelled each other at the population level, so that the net effect of the noise correlations was negligible and attention could be decoded reliably. Our results suggest that noise correlations are caused by large-scale fluctuations in cortical excitability, which can be removed by a comparison of the response strengths evoked by different objects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>discrimination</kwd><kwd>neural coding</kwd><kwd>noise correlation</kwd><kwd>vision</kwd><kwd>visual cortex</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons in the visual cortex act as detectors: they code the properties of the stimulus in their receptive field. In early visual areas, the coding of basic features like orientations and colors is robust, and information about these stimulus properties is present as soon as the neurons are activated by the appropriate visual stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Celebrini et al. 1993</xref>). This suggests that the neurons' selectivity is generated locally within the cortical column or inherited from the previous processing levels. In addition, the activity of neurons in early visual areas is modulated by the behavioral context. One type of task where these modulations are observed is perceptual grouping, where the subject's aim is to determine whether image elements belong to the same object or not. In such a task, the neurons that code the image elements that need to be grouped together enhance their response relative to neurons coding nongrouped features or background, as if the entire representation of the relevant object is &#x0201c;labeled&#x0201d; with an enhanced response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lamme 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roelfsema et al. 1998</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roelfsema 2006</xref>). These response modulations have a correlate in psychology because object-based attention is directed to precisely those image elements that are labeled with the response enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Houtkamp et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>The perceptual grouping process starts to modulate neuronal responses after a delay relative to the initial response triggered by the appearance of a stimulus in the receptive field, which suggests that it requires a time-consuming integration of information within and between visual areas. We previously proposed that V1 neurons may actively participate in this process if they propagate the enhanced response through horizontal connections, which tend to link neurons tuned to contour elements in collinear configurations that are likely to belong to the same object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roelfsema 2006</xref>). Area V1 provides a high-resolution representation of the visual scene, and this could be important for the correct grouping of nearby contour elements. In a curve-tracing task, where the subject has to determine which contour elements belong to the same elongated curve, V1 responses evoked by grouped contour elements are, indeed, enhanced relative to the responses evoked by nongrouped elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roelfsema et al. 1998</xref>). However, such a causal role of the primary visual cortex in the grouping process presupposes that the V1 neurons reliably code the set of contour elements that are grouped together. The modulation of neuronal responses during perceptual grouping is weaker than the feature-driven responses and might be difficult to detect in the presence of neuronal noise&#x02014;the activity fluctuations that are observed from trial to trial if the stimulus is held constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tomko and Crapper 1974</xref>). Thus, it is not yet clear whether the response modulation in area V1 can reliably distinguish relevant, to-be-grouped image elements from irrelevant ones. In the present study, we therefore ask how well neurons in the primary visual cortex (area V1) differentiate between relevant and irrelevant image elements. Most previous studies on the neurophysiological correlates of visual attention investigated the average neuronal responses collected across a number of trials, but here we wish to decode the locus of attention on an individual trial. Specifically, we will try to combine the responses of different neurons recorded simultaneously on the same trial, instead of pooling across trials.</p><p>In general, multiple neurons should convey more information about the locus of attention than a single cell. The law of large numbers states that the variance of the average response of a population of neurons decreases linearly with neuron number if cells fire independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rice 1995</xref>). However, we know that the responses of neighboring cortical neurons are correlated, with correlation coefficients in the range of 0.1&#x02013;0.2 (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gawne and Richmond 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zohary et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gawne et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bair et al. 2001</xref>), and these so-called &#x0201c;noise correlations&#x0201d; influence the benefit of pooling. On the one hand, noise correlations reduce the reliability of the pooled responses if neurons are tuned to the same feature because the correlated variability also enters in their average response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shadlen et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Dayan 1999</xref>). On the other hand, the correlations need not be detrimental when evaluating the responses of neurons tuned to different features. The differences between the magnitudes of responses of neurons tuned to dissimilar features are maintained in the presence of overall fluctuations in activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oram et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Averbeck et al. 2006</xref>). Thus, the net effect of the noise correlations on the reliability of the attentional code remains to be determined.</p><p>In what follows, we will try to decode the locus of attention in a curve-tracing task in which monkeys had to group together contour segments of a target curve while ignoring a distracter curve. We will measure the reliability of the response enhancement at individual recording sites in area V1 and investigate how much information can be gained by pooling responses across recording sites. Here we will describe the modulation of neuronal responses by the curve-tracing task as a relative enhancement of responses evoked by the target curve. We note, however, that our study was not designed to determine whether the response modulation arises from an enhancement of responses to the target curve, a suppression of the responses evoked by the distracter curve or both. We will also determine the strengths of the noise correlations and evaluate whether they are helpful or harmful for the population code.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We analyzed data from a previous study on the strength of synchrony and noise correlations in area V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roelfsema et al. 2004</xref>).

They were seated at a distance of 0.75 m from a monitor (resolution 1024 &#x000d7; 768, frame rate 70 Hz) while they performed a curve-tracing task. A trial started as soon as the monkey's eye position was within a 1- &#x000d7; 1-degree window centered on the fixation point (0.2 degree). After an interval of 300 ms, 2 circles and 2 curves appeared on the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) while the monkey maintained fixation. The circles and the fixation point were red and the curves white (luminance 85 cd m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) on a black background (luminance 1.5 cd m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>). After an additional 600 ms, the fixation point disappeared and the monkey had to make an eye movement to one of the circles. Eye movements to the circle that was connected to the fixation point by a curve that will be called target curve were rewarded with apple juice, whereas eye movements to the circle on the end of the other curve (distracter) were not. A small change close to the fixation point switched the target and distracter curve (compare the 2 stimuli in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). We presented the 2 stimulus configurations in a randomly interleaved sequence so that the same curve could appear as target or distracter.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The curve-tracing task.

After 600 ms, the fixation point disappeared and the monkey had to make a saccade (gray arrow) to the saccade target at the end of the curve connected to the fixation point (target curve).

In the first operation, a head holder was implanted and a gold ring was inserted under the conjunctiva of one eye for the measurement of eye position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bour et al. 1984</xref>). In the second operation, 40&#x02013;50 Teflon-coated or polyimide-coated platinum&#x02013;iridium wires (diameter 25 &#x003bc;m, impedance 0.1&#x02013;0.8 M&#x003a9; at 100 Hz) were implanted chronically in area V1. The tips of the wires were positioned 1&#x02013;2 mm below the cortical surface. The animals recovered for at least 21 days before training was resumed, and data collection was initiated. All procedures complied with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p></sec><sec><title>Recordings</title><p>The eye position was measured with a double magnetic induction technique, sampled, and recorded at a rate between 500 and 1000 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bour et al. 1984</xref>). To record multiunit activity (MUA), the signals from the chronically implanted electrodes were amplified, band-pass filtered (750&#x02013;5000 Hz), full-wave rectified, and then low-pass filtered at 500 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Legatt et al. 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sup&#x000e8;r and Roelfsema 2005</xref>). MUA represents the pooled activity of a number of single units in the vicinity of the tip of the electrode. The population response obtained with this method is expected to be identical to the population response obtained by pooling across single units. We recently compared MUA with single-unit data in a curve-tracing and a figure-ground segregation task and found that MUA, indeed, provides a reliable estimate of the average single-unit response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sup&#x000e8;r and Roelfsema 2005</xref>). Moreover, the reliability of the attentional effect at MUA recording sites was in the same range as the reliability of single-unit responses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhn103/DC1">Supplementary Information</ext-link>). We measured the receptive field dimensions of every recording site by determining the onset and offset of the response to a slowly moving light bar for each of 8 movement directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kato et al. 1978</xref>). The median receptive field size was 0.54 degree<sup>2</sup> (range 0.11&#x02013;9.4 degree<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>We quantified visual responsiveness by calculating the mean activity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="cercorbhn103fx1_ht.jpg"/></inline-formula> and the standard deviation (SD), <italic>s</italic>, across trials in 2 time windows relative to stimulus onset: <italic>w</italic><sub>1</sub> = [&#x02212;200, 0] ms (spontaneous activity) and <italic>w</italic><sub>2</sub> = [0, 200] ms (initial response) and then computed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="cercorbhn103fx2_ht.jpg"/></inline-formula>.

The mean number of trials per stimulus condition was 89 (range 36&#x02013;199).</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>To compute the population responses, we first normalized the responses before averaging across recording sites.

We normalized neuronal responses by subtracting <italic>Sp</italic> and dividing the result by (<italic>Pe</italic> &#x02212; <italic>Sp</italic>). To quantify the strength of the attentional effects, we computed the modulation index (MI), which we defined as the difference in response strength normalized to the average response: (<italic>T</italic> &#x02212; <italic>D</italic>)/((<italic>T</italic> + <italic>D</italic>)/2). Here <italic>T</italic> and <italic>D</italic> are the responses to the target and distracter curve after subtraction of the spontaneous firing rate, in a time window of <italic>w</italic><sub>3</sub> = [200, 600] ms relative to stimulus onset.</p><p>The strength of the noise correlation, that is, the degree of coupling of the response strengths at different recording sites across trials, was quantified with the correlation coefficient. If we compared distributions of correlation coefficients, then we first applied Fisher's <italic>z</italic>-transformation to obtain normal distributions. We showed 2 complementary stimuli, and we, therefore, obtained 2 correlation coefficients for every pair of recording sites. These correlation coefficients are expected to be comparable for pairs of recording sites with receptive fields (RF) on different curves (1-1 pairs) because for both stimuli one RF was on the target curve and the other one on the distracter curve. However, if the RFs fell on the same curve, they both fell either on the target curve or on the distracter curve (2-0 pairs). We compared the average strength of the noise correlations for 2-0 pairs evoked by the target and distracter curve and found them to be equivalent (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.11). We will therefore report the average correlation coefficients for the 1-1 and 2-0 pairs.

To measure how much information is present in the pattern of neuronal activity on a single trial, we also computed the classification rate, the percentage of trials where the stimulus is correctly decoded from the neuronal responses by applying the linear discriminant. We used a cross-validation procedure to prevent overfitting: we partitioned the trials into a training set (random selection of half of the data) and a validation set (other half of the data), estimated the optimal weights in the training set, and used these weights to measure classification in the validation set. We then repeated this procedure with taking the second half of the data as the training set and the first half as the validation set and averaged these 2 values.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The curve-tracing task is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

The distributions of the MIs across the population of N-sites (average MI = 0.05) and A-sites (average MI = 0.31) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3<italic>C</italic></xref>.

Previous theories showed that the information gain depends on the correlation between firing rates of recording sites across trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shadlen et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oram et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Dayan 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Averbeck et al. 2006</xref>). We therefore started our analysis of paired recordings with a quantification of the noise correlation. We computed the noise correlations in a window from 200 to 600 ms after stimulus presentation because the attentional response modulation was most pronounced in this epoch. First, we investigated how the noise correlation depends on the distance between recording sites. We compared the noise correlation between pairs of recording sites with nearby receptive fields (&#x0003c;1 degree, <italic>N</italic> = 122) and pairs of recording sites with receptive fields that were farther apart (&#x0003e;1 degree, <italic>N</italic> = 265). The noise correlation was slightly stronger for the neurons with nearby receptive fields (median correlation coefficient 0.24 vs. 0.19, <italic>U</italic>-test, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), which may be due to common input from the lateral geniculate nucleus. In the rest of the Results, we will focus on the pairs of recording sites with distant receptive fields (&#x0003e;1 degree) as our aim is to compare the influence of noise correlations for combinations of neurons with receptive fields on the same and on different curves, and we did not attempt to stimulate neurons with overlapping receptive fields with different curves. Within the subgroup of pairs with nonoverlapping receptive fields, the noise correlation did not exhibit a strong dependence on the receptive field distance (<italic>r</italic> = 0.04, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.5, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Also, the noise correlation within this subgroup did not depend on the estimated cortical distance between electrodes (<italic>r</italic> = 0.02, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). To investigate if and how the noise correlation changed during a trial, we computed the noise correlations in 4 different time windows relative to stimulus onset, [&#x02212;200, 0], [0, 200], [200, 400], and [400, 600] ms for all paired recordings. The noise correlation was similar across these time windows (repeated-measures analysis of variance, <italic>F</italic><sub>3,1158</sub> = 0.18, <italic>P</italic> = 0.97) and is thus fairly constant over time. In <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhn103/DC1">Supplementary Information</ext-link>, we demonstrate that the noise correlations are not caused by variations in eye position across trials.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Noise correlation statistics.

There is a temporal separation between the coding of basic tuning properties, which is apparent from the onset of the response, and the attentional effects that are weaker and occur after an additional delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lamme and Roelfsema 2000</xref>) in area V1 as well as in extrastriate areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chelazzi et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Motter 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reynolds et al. 1999</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Treue 2001</xref>). In the curve-tracing task, it takes about 130 ms before all the contour elements belonging to the target curve are labeled with an enhanced neuronal response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roelfsema et al. 2003</xref>). When we studied a variant of this task in human subjects, we found that they direct their attention to all the contour elements that belong to a target curve. This suggests that labeling contour elements with an enhanced response (attention) is the way that the visual system can &#x0201c;bind&#x0201d; these contour elements into a coherent representation of an elongated curve (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roelfsema 2006</xref>).</p><p>The reliability of the attention signal in area V1 is consistent with an active role in the grouping process. V1 provides a retinotopic map with a high spatial resolution so that perceptual objects can be segregated from each other, even if they are close together. We note, however, that not all V1 neurons carry information about attention. We distinguished between A-sites that are modulated by attention and N-sites that are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roelfsema et al. 2004</xref>). The N-sites (&#x0223c;40% of recording sites) represent the contour elements irrespective of the context in which they occur, and they may thereby provide a &#x0201c;veridical&#x0201d; map of the visual scene that is independent of attention shifts. Here we have focused on the A-sites (&#x0223c;60%) that may form another map of the visual field highlighting the objects relevant for behavior. The classification rate at some of these A-sites was only slightly better than chance, at others it was almost perfect, whereas the average classification rate was approximately 70%. In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al. (2006)</xref> investigated the activity of single V1 neurons in another contour integration task where monkeys had to discriminate between a string of collinearly aligned contour elements and a random arrangement of contour elements. The discrimination performance of most of their neurons was striking: they were as sensitive to the collinear contour alignments as the monkeys were at a behavioral level. This contrasts with our finding that there is a substantial proportion of N-sites in the curve-tracing task, which represent clusters of nearby neurons not modulated by attention. This difference between results may be related to the task, as Li et al. manipulated the alignment of contour elements in the vicinity of the neurons' RFs, whereas the cue segment in the curve-tracing task that determines the identity of target and distracter curve is generally at a larger distance from the RFs. Another difference is that Li et al. mainly recorded from the superficial layers of cortex whereas most of our electrodes were in the deep layers. Previous studies on the neurophysiological correlates of attention shifts in striate and extrastriate cortex almost invariably found a mixture of &#x0201c;A-neurons&#x0201d; modulated by attention shifts and &#x0201c;N-neurons&#x0201d; that were not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chelazzi et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Motter 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Treue and Maunsell 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reynolds and Desimone 1999</xref>). These previous studies did not quantify the single-trial classification rates, but the attentional effects were generally weak if compared with the visual responses, just as in the present study. It is therefore important to understand how the responses from multiple neurons can be combined to increase the reliability of coding of attention and how the noise correlations influence the combined reliability.</p></sec><sec><title>Noise Correlation</title><p>The distribution of noise correlation coefficients between activities at the V1 recording sites was shifted to positive values with an average value of 0.21. This value is consistent with a number of previous studies in V1 (0.22 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gawne et al. 1996</xref>; 0.25 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reich et al. 2001</xref>; 0.20 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kohn and Smith 2005</xref>) and other areas, including inferior temporal cortex (0.23 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gawne and Richmond 1993</xref>) supplementary motor area (0.13 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Averbeck and Lee 2006</xref>) and the middle temporal visual area (0.19 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zohary et al. 1994</xref>). We did not observe a strong relationship between the strength of the noise correlations and the distance between the V1 recording sites and noticed that the strength of the noise correlations was similar before and after stimulus presentation. These results are consistent with a previous study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al. (2006)</xref> who used voltage-sensitive dyes to measure the activity of a V1 region in a target detection task. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al. (2006)</xref> found that the presentation of the visual stimulus has little effect on the noise correlation, just as was found in the present study. Moreover, in the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al. (2006)</xref>, the average correlation decreased gradually with cortical distance within the imaged region of 4 mm, which is consistent with our finding that the correlation was stronger for the neurons with nearby receptive fields (&#x0003c;1 degree) than for neurons with more distant receptive fields. Our study adds to these results by showing that the noise correlation does not decrease further with larger distances within area V1 as it remained relatively constant for distances between 4 and 24 mm. These results, taken together, seem to suggest that a large fraction of the noise correlation represents relatively global variations in cortical excitability as could be caused, for example, by fluctuations in the activity of neuromodulatory systems that are related to variations in arousal. We note, however, that the pattern of the noise correlations is not entirely unstructured because the correlations are slightly but significantly stronger between neurons with RFs on the same curve than between neurons with RFs on different curves (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roelfsema et al. 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Influence of Noise Correlation on the Reliability of the Attentional Code</title><p>Theoretical work suggested that the impact of noise correlations depends on the tuning of the neurons that are combined: positive correlations between neurons that have the same tuning are harmful, whereas positive correlations between neurons with different tuning allow for subtraction of common noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Snippe and Koenderink 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oram et al. 1998</xref>). Initial empirical work emphasized the adverse effects of noise correlations between neurons with similar tuning curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zohary et al. 1994</xref>). However, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Romo et al. (2003)</xref> showed that the effects of noise correlations on coding accuracy in primary and secondary somatosensory cortex of monkeys performing a vibrotactile discrimination task are mixed. Some cells in these areas prefer higher stimulus frequencies, whereas others prefer lower frequencies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Romo et al. (2003)</xref> observed a loss in accuracy caused by positive correlations (with an average correlation coefficient of 0.12) between neurons tuned to the same frequency, but this was partially offset by an improvement caused by positive correlation between neurons tuned to different frequencies. Thus, if the aim is to decode a sensory property in the presence of common noise, then it is beneficial to compare the response of neurons tuned to different features.</p><p>Our results are compatible with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Romo et al. (2003)</xref>, although we recorded the activity from neurons in another sensory modality and focused on the neurons&#x02019; attentional modulation rather than on their tuning. Noise correlation decreased the information gain for neuronal responses evoked by the same curve (with &#x00394;<italic>d</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003c; 0) and increased the information gain for responses evoked by different curves (&#x00394;<italic>d</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003e; 0). Overall, the decreases in accuracy for the 2-0 pairs were offset by a comparable increase in accuracy for the 1-1 pairs so that pooling across the neurons improved the accuracy of the code considerably. Thus, in the presence of widespread positive correlations, neurons coding for the same object provide partially redundant information, whereas neurons coding for different objects can be used to remove the influence of global activity fluctuations (common noise) unrelated to selective attention. The optimal discriminant, indeed, removed the common noise by computing the difference between the responses evoked by the target and distracter curve. These results generalized to triplets and quadruplets of recording sites as discrimination continued to improve when information from additional recording sites was added, in particular, if these recording sites had RFs on different curves. Remarkably, the adverse and beneficial effects of the noise correlations cancelled each other for combinations of 2, 3, and 4 recording sites so that the overall coding accuracy was close to that expected in the absence of noise correlations.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms for Removal of Common Noise</title><p>The removal of global fluctuations in neuronal activity can be achieved in several ways. Here we only recorded from neurons with an RF on one of the curves and compared the strengths of neuronal responses evoked by the target and distracter curve. This comparison is presumably difficult to implement in neuronal hardware, especially if the shape of the curves changes from trial to trial, because the weights of the linear discriminant depend on the RFs that fall on the same and on different curves. We note, however, that the only requirement for the removal of common noise is an estimate of the overall V1 activity level, which can be obtained in several ways. First, it is possible to compare the activity of neurons at A- and N-sites with overlapping RFs. This activity difference gives a reliable measure of the locus of attention in the presence of global variations of neuronal activity. If a contour element is relevant for the task, then the A-neurons are more active than the N-neurons, whereas the 2 classes of neurons are equally active if the contour element in their RF is part of the distracter. Thus, a connection scheme where A-neurons are excited by neighboring A-neurons but inhibited by the N-neurons can propagate the response enhancement along the target curve. Second, measures of the overall V1 activity can be obtained in higher areas where neurons have large receptive fields. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bair et al. (2003)</xref> provided evidence that these higher areas provide inhibitory feedback to area V1, and we suggest that the neuronal response at an A-site can also be compared with the strength of such a feedback signal in order to determine whether a contour element is relevant or not.</p><p>Finally, we note that the linear discriminants used in the present study can be implemented in an anatomical projection from lower to higher areas. Downstream neurons involved in the selection of a behavioral response can extract the relative saliency of one of a number of objects if they receive excitation from the representation of this object and inhibition from the representation of the other ones. The response modulations observed in early visual areas that are associated with attention shifts are reflected by comparable response modulations in areas involved in response selection, like the frontal eye fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schall and Thompson 1999</xref>). Neurons in the frontal eye fields code the eye movement to a particular location in the visual field, and they receive excitatory visual input from the corresponding retinotopic location and inhibition from other retinotopic locations and engage in a competitive process where the eye movement plan receiving most activation eventually wins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruce et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seidemann et al. 2002</xref>). Thus, also at this level, differences between the activation of eye movement plans determine the outcome of the competition, so that global fluctuations in activity cancel out.</p><p>Here we have shown that the focus of attention can be decoded from a relatively small sample of the activity in area V1. We hypothesize that the processes that propagate the enhanced response along the target curve and that select the required eye movement take advantage of the proposed mechanisms for noise cancellation, so that all the information present in the neuronal responses can be brought to bear during such an attention-demanding task.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><grant-sponsor>The European Union</grant-sponsor> (EU IST Cognitive Systems, project 027198 &#x0201c;Decisions in Motion&#x0201d;); <grant-sponsor>The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research</grant-sponsor> Vici grant awarded to P.R.R.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhn103/DC1">Supplementary Information</ext-link> can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cercor.oxfordjournals.org/">http://www.cercor.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="bhn103_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bhn103_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Victor Lamme for his assistance in the surgeries and Kor Brandsma and Jacques de Feiter for biotechnical assistance.
