Introduction</title><p>As sessile organisms, plants have developed adaptive strategies to cope with environmental stress by expressing specific genes and synthesizing a variety of proteins or compounds including transcription factors, late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins, transporters, antioxidants, proline, and sugars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-09-02601">1</xref>]. They are categorized either as effectors, which directly modulate or attenuate stress effects, or as regulators that are involved in stress perception, signal transduction, or regulation of effectors. LEA proteins have been considered to play roles in maintenance membrane structures, binding of water, and acting as molecular chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-09-02601">2</xref>]. Sugar and other compatible solutes serve as osmoprotectants and stabilize biomolecules. For instance, accumulation of trehalose, a nonreducing disaccharide of glucose, in rice plants confers high tolerance levels to different abiotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-09-02601">3</xref>].</p><p>AP2/ERFs have been identified as a large gene family of plant transcription factors and contain a conserved basic 58 or 59-amino acid DNA-binding domain, defined as ERF domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-09-02601">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-09-02601">5</xref>]. A comprehensive computational analysis identified 122 and 139 ERF family genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-09-02601">6</xref>]. ERF proteins have found to play important roles in plant adaptation to abiotic stress, such as drought, cold, salt oxidative stress and ABA response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-09-02601">7</xref>]. The barley ERF protein HvRAF enhances salt tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijms-09-02601">8</xref>]. Three <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ERFs, DREB1A, DREB2A, and CBF1, are induced in response to drought or cold stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-09-02601">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-09-02601">9</xref>]. Further, ectopic expression of the genes such as <italic>CBF1</italic> or <italic>DREB1A</italic> has been shown to improve dehydration stress tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-09-02601">10</xref>]. Dubouzet <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-09-02601">11</xref>] isolated five DREB homologs from rice, in which overexpression OsDREB1A increased tolerant to drought in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In previous study, we have demonstrated that OPBP1, an ERF transcription factor isolated from tobacco is mediated in disease resistance and salt tolerance in tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-09-02601">12</xref>]. In this report, we generated <italic>OPBP1</italic> overexpressing rice plants and found the transgenic progenies exhibited enhanced disease resistance against <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> and <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic>, as well as tolerance to salt stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>2. Results</title><sec><title>2.1. Expression of stress-inducible genes in OPBP1 transgenic plants</title><p>Since OPBP1 was a regulator of disease resistance and salt tolerance in tobacco, we extended the study to examine a possible biological function of OPBP1 in rice. <italic>OPBP1</italic> gene was constructed under the control of a maize ubiquitin promoter (<italic>Ubi:OPBP1</italic>). Thirty independent lines were obtained by <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation method. Expression of the transgene in some of T<sub>2</sub> progenies was examined by northern blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-09-02601">Figure 1A</xref>, accumulation of <italic>OPBP1</italic> mRNA was increased in roots, although the level of accumulation varied between different lines.</p><p>To examine the induction of gene expression in <italic>OPBP1</italic> overexpressing plants, we chose several stress-inducible rice genes, such as delta-l-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (<italic>OsP5CS</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-09-02601">13</xref>], <italic>OsGSTu1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-09-02601">14</xref>] encoding for glutathione-S-transferase, and <italic>OsIM1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-09-02601">15</xref>], sharing homology with <italic>AOX</italic> members of <italic>AtIM</italic> and <italic>PTOX.</italic> Overall, expression of <italic>OsGST</italic>, <italic>OsIM1</italic> and <italic>OsP5CS</italic> genes was increased in the transgenic <italic>OPBP1</italic> plants in comparison with the control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-09-02601">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>2.2. Expression of OPBP1 enhances salt tolerance in rice</title><p>To investigate the response to salinity, the transgenic rice seedlings of T<sub>2</sub> progenies were grown for two weeks in 1/2 MS containing different concentrations of NaCl in the presence of hygromycin. The growth was suppressed with the increase of NaCl concentration both in the transgenic and the control plants. The heights in the presence of 200 mM NaCl were about one quarter of those without NaCl for both the control and transgenic lines (data not shown). Comparing the root growth between the transgenic and control plants, the length of roots in <italic>OPBP1</italic> overexpressing plants was even slightly increased in the presence of 100 or 150 mM NaCl, whereas the root length did not change significantly in the control plants under this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-09-02601">Figure 2</xref>). Increase of NaCl up to 200 mM, the root growth was inhibited in both the transgenic and control lines. The effects of salt on plants are considered to be caused by ionic toxicity and osmotic pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-09-02601">16</xref>]. To examine the osmotic effect, rice seedlings were treated with osmotic reagent PEG 6000 (12.1%, w/v), whose osmotic pressure was about that of 100 mM NaCl. At this concentration of PEG6000, the root growth was even stimulated slightly at the osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-09-02601">Figure 2C</xref>). The results suggest that inhibition of rice growth by NaCl treatment is possibly due to the ionic toxicity.</p><p>To examine the recovery capacity of salt-treated plants, the rice seedlings grown in 200 mM NaCl for two weeks were transferred to normal 1/2MS medium for recovery. After another two weeks, the control plants did not grow significantly, as revealed by measurement of the plant heights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-09-02601">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>In line with this, the Fv/Fm value of the control plants, a parameter often used as an indicator of the efficiency of primary photochemistry in photosystem II (PSII), decreased in comparing with the <italic>OPBP1</italic> expressing lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-09-02601">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, the number of crown roots was more in the <italic>Ubi:OPBP1</italic> plants than the controls and the lengths of crown roots were longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-09-02601">Figure 3C</xref>, D). Also, for most of the <italic>OPBP1</italic> transgenic plants, the average biomass of the seedlings were near double the weight of the controls (data not shown).</p><p>Furthermore, the <italic>OPBP1</italic> transgenic and control plants were examined for their restorable capability after high salinity shock. Three-week-old rice seedlings were exposed to 250 mM NaCl for 18 h. With this treatment, about 37% of the youngest leaves of the control seedlings showed morphological wilting. Then, the treated seedlings were washed off and planted in soil for restoration. Within a seven-day-period of recovery, the control seedlings did not show obvious growth and about 31% of them died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-09-02601">Figure 4</xref>). On the other hand, the death of <italic>OPBP1</italic> overexpressing plants was significantly less compared with the control lines. The damage on the secondary leaves was more severe in the control lines than the <italic>OPBP1</italic> overexpressing plants, as indicated by the Fv/Fm values on day 4 after the treatment. New emergent leaves in the <italic>Ubi:OPBP1</italic> plants survived. The results suggest that overexpressing <italic>OPBP1</italic> increase the detoxification capability of rice.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3. Overexpression of OPBP1 increases tolerance to oxidative damage and resistance against rice fungal pathogens</title><p>Since generation of reactive oxygen species and programmed cell death are mediated in salinity stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-09-02601">17</xref>], the tolerance against oxidative stress of the <italic>OPBP1</italic> overexpressing and control plants was studied by treatment the plants with paraquat (Pq), which is a chemical producing superoxide anion and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, the Fv/Fm values were measured to evaluate the damage of the plants. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-09-02601">Figure 5</xref>, decreases of Fv/Fm values were apparent in both the <italic>OPBP1</italic> overexpressing and the control plants 24 h after treatment with Pq. However, the <italic>OPBP1</italic> overexpressing plants showed less extent of decrease in Fv/Fm values comparing with the control plants, suggesting that overexpression of <italic>OPBP1</italic> stimulated the protective mechanism of rice plants against oxidative damage.</p><p>Rice blast, caused by <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, is a disastrous crop disease worldwide. To examine the effect of the transgene on disease resistance, the transgenic and control plants were inoculated with a virulent isolate of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> 97-220E3. Severity of disease development was evaluated by counting the number of lesions and measuring the size of lesions on infected leaves. The lesion numbers were reduced in the <italic>OPBP1</italic> overexpressing lines, especially lines 3, 11, and 21, comparing with the control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-09-02601">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-09-02601">6B</xref>). Also, the lesions on the leaves of the transgenic plants were considerably smaller in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-09-02601">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Rice sheath blight is also a severe disease caused by <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic>. We inoculated the transgenic and control plants with an isolate of <italic>R. solani</italic> YN-7 and found that the lesion development was slower in the <italic>OPBP1</italic> overexpressing lines in comaprison with the control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-09-02601">Figure 6C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Genes induced by a stress are considered to play roles in responses to it. The early induced genes are required for stress perception, signal transduction or immediate protection, whereas those induced later are possibly involved in homeostasis and recovery. Overexpression of <italic>OPBP1</italic>, an early immediate gene, results in a high tolerance to salt stress and enhanced resistance against pathogen attacks in tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-09-02601">12</xref>]. Also, several reports have demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>ERF</italic> genes enhances the ability of transgenic plants to withstand environmental cues. Ectopic expression of <italic>CBF1/DREB1</italic> genes activated cold responsive genes and enhanced cold and osmotic tolerance of non-acclimated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants. DREB2, on the other hand, was found to be involved in drought-responsive gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-09-02601">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-09-02601">10</xref>]. In this study, ectopic expression of <italic>OPBP1</italic> gene enhanced tolerance to salt stress as well as resistance against <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and <italic>R. solani</italic> pathogens, suggesting OPBP1 probably functions in a similar way in rice as in tobacco.</p><p>The damage cause by salt stress is often related to the production of oxidative stress. A number of reports have demonstrated that enhancement of the ROS scavenging systems in plants can provide protection from oxidative damage. For instance, overexpression of GST in tobacco showed substantial improvement of seedling growth under stressful condition including chilling and salinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-09-02601">18</xref>]. This protective effect appears to scavenge products of lipid peroxidation generated as a result of enhanced ROS production. Overexpression of <italic>OPBP1</italic> gene increased the level of <italic>OsGSTu</italic> expression except of line S7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-09-02601">Figure 1B</xref>). This low <italic>OsGSTu</italic> expression level in line S7 seems to coincide with its lesser restoration capability from salt-stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-09-02601">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-09-02601">3D</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>OsIM</italic> gene is induced by salt stress and has been estimated to decrease the content of ROS generated under salt-stress condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-09-02601">15</xref>]. OsIM shares homology with AtIM from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and PTOX from tomato, which function as a plastid terminal oxidase for carotenoid synthesis in the phytogene de-saturation step. Carotenoids can prevent plants from oxidative stress by reacting with reactive oxygen species directly or indirectly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijms-09-02601">19</xref>]. Increase the level of <italic>OsIM1</italic> expression in <italic>OPBP1</italic> transgenic plants suggests again that the transgenic provides higher level of ROS scavenging capacity. In support of this, we observed a relative increase of paraquat tolerance in <italic>OPBP1</italic> overexpressing plants comparing with the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-09-02601">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>One of the mechanisms for plant adaptation to water deficiency is the accumulation of low-molecular-weight organic compatible solutes such as sugars, some amino acids and quaternary ammonium compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-09-02601">20</xref>]. We examined the expression of some stress-related genes, such as <italic>OsP5CS</italic>, encoding a key enzyme for proline biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-09-02601">13</xref>]. <italic>OsP5CS</italic> is induced by salt stress, cold stress, drought and the treatment of exogenous ABA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-09-02601">13</xref>]. The expression of <italic>OsP5CS</italic> and the accumulation of proline induced by high-salt treatment have been demonstrated to relate to the degree of salt tolerance in rice. In agreement, the increase in mRNA accumulation of <italic>OsP5CS</italic> in the transgenic plants suggest that overexpression of <italic>OPBP1</italic> may help avoid stress associated injuries and better recovery from stress. High salt stress disrupts homeostasis in water potential and ion distribution. To achieve salt tolerance, one of strategies is to help plants to re-establish both ionic and osmotic homeostasis in stressful environments. Increase osmotic stress by treatment with PEG increased root growths of transgenic and wild-type rice plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-09-02601">Figure 3C</xref>), especially the increase in line S3 was significant different from the control plant coincident with the expression of <italic>OPBP1</italic> in line S3, which was the highest among the plants studied. The results suggest that the high level of expressing <italic>OPBP1</italic> in the transgenic plant probably lead more rapidly or strongly responsing to osmotic stress. The identification of molecular switches and regulatory genes would provide a better tool for crop improvement strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>4. Experimental Section</title><sec><title>4.1. Construction of plasmids and rice transformation</title><p>To overexpress <italic>OPBP1</italic> gene in rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> subsp. <italic>japanica</italic> var. Xiushui 11), the cDNA of <italic>OPBP1</italic> was digested with <italic>Bam</italic>H I/<italic>Sac</italic> I and inserted into pCoU linearized with the same enzymes. <italic>OPBP1</italic> gene was under the control of a maize ubiquitin promoter and terminated with an rbcs terminator in the generated plasmid (CoU-Ubi:<italic>OPBP1</italic>). Rice transformation was performed as described by Hiei <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijms-09-02601">21</xref>]. Hygromycin B-resistant plants were grown in the greenhouse and set seeds.</p></sec><sec><title>4.2. RNA isolation and northern blot</title><p>Total RNA from rice leaves was isolated using the Trizol Reagent Kit according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. An aliquot of 20&#x003bc;g total RNA was fractionated in a 1.0% denaturing agarose formaldehyde gel and subsequently transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham). Hybridizations were performed with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled <italic>OPBP1</italic> cDNA fragment as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-09-02601">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>4.3. Chemical treatments</title><p>The rice seeds of T<sub>2</sub> progenies were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol for 5 min and with 2.5% NaClO for 30 min. They were washed thoroughly, soaked in distilled water for 48 h, and incubated for 24 h at 30 &#x000b0;C in the dark conditions. The germinated seeds were sown in 300 mL plastic cups with dark cloth outside. The seedlings were grown on the medium containing 1/2 MS salts without sucrose and organic ingredients, in the presence of 0, 100, 150, and 200 mM NaCl, respectively. For osmotic treatment, we used a 12.1% PEG6000 solution, which had a similar osmotic potential (&#x02013;0.58 Mpa) as 100 mM NaCl solution. After 14 days growth at 25 &#x000b0;C with a day/night cycles of 16/8 h, the heights and root length of the seedlings were measured.</p><p>To examine the recovery capability, the seedlings grew in 200 mM NaCl for two weeks were transfered to a new 1/2 MS medium in the absence of NaCl for 14 days more growth. Then, the seedlings were harvested for measurement of parameters. In order to investigate the seedlings tolerance to salt shock, the germinated seeds of the T<sub>2</sub> and the control lines were sown in pots filled with a mixture of soil and vermiculite (1:1, v/v) and grown in the field under a 14/10 h (light/dark) photoperiod at 27 &#x000b0;C for 3 weeks with daily watering. The seedlings were treated or not with 250 mM NaCl for 18 h. After this treatment, the seedlings were washed with water and allowed to grow under normal condition for another 35 days. The values of Fv/Fm of the secondary leaves were determined at the planned time. The dry weights were measured after placing fresh seedlings in an 80 &#x000b0;C oven for 72 hours.</p><p>For paraquat treatment, leaf blade pieces about 3 cm in length each from the secondary leaves of 3-week-old seedlings were floated on a 30&#x003bc;M paraquat solution. Equivalent leaf blade sections were incubated on sterile water without paraquat treatments as a control. The leaf blade sections were incubated for 24 h at 25 &#x000b0;C under continuous illumination (200 W/m<sup>2</sup>/s) until sampling.</p></sec><sec><title>4.4. Determination of chlorophyll fluorescence</title><p>Measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence was performed with a fluorometer. Fluorescence signals were from the second leaf of each rice plant, which had been dark-adapted for 15 min, were measured at the indicated times. The ratio of Fv to Fm (Fv/Fm) representing the activity of photosystem II was used to assess the functional damage to the plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijms-09-02601">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>4.5. Pathogen inoculation</title><p>A virulent (97-220E3) isolate of the blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> was used in this study.

After incubation in a dark chamber (at 22 &#x000b0;C and 95% relative humidity) for 24 h, plants were moved to a growth chamber and maintained at 28 &#x000b0;C with 16 h of light and 8 h of dark cycles. Disease symptoms were evaluated and photographed. Number of lesions per leaf was counted as the size of the lesions was measured. The experiment was repeated three times in rice seedlings with similar results.</p><p>The isolate of <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> (YN-7) was used in this study. Three-week-old seedlings of control and <italic>OPBP1</italic> lines were inoculated with YN-7, following the procedure described by Jia <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijms-09-02601">24</xref>]. The greenhouse temperate averaged 28 &#x000b0;C, and relative humidity was maintained within 70% to 80%. Lesion development was monitored starting 3 days post inoculation. The length of the lesion was measured. Sheath blight micro-chamber inoculations were repeated twice.</p></sec><sec><title>4.6. RT-PCR analysis</title><p>To remove possible DNA contamination, the total RNA was treated with DNase, then was heated at 70 &#x000b0;C for 10 min to inactivate the DNase, then followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The first strand cDNAs were synthesized by using the AMV reverse transcriptase system in 20 &#x003bc;L reactions, including 1 &#x003bc;g purified total RNA. After synthesis, the cDNA was diluted and used as template for PCR amplifications in 50 &#x003bc;L standard reactions. For RT-PCR, actin was used as internal constitutive control. The PCR products were separated on 1.6% w/v agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographic images were obtained.

Conclusions</title><p><italic>OPBP1</italic> gene, an AP2/ERF transcription factor of tobacco, seems to be an important determinant of biotic and abiotic stress response in plants. Transgenic rice plants with overexpressed <italic>OPBP1</italic> gene accumulated higher levels of <italic>OsP5CS</italic>, <italic>OsGSTu1</italic> and <italic>OsIM1</italic>, which are reported to be involved in the signaling pathways of salt or oxidative stress tolerant. <italic>OPBP1</italic> overexpression lines exhibited enhanced tolerance to salt and oxidative stress, as well as to infection of <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> and <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> pathogens. These results suggest that expression of <italic>OPBP1</italic> gene increase the detoxification capability of rice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by Commonweal Specialized Research Fund of China Agriculture (3&#x02013;16) and Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (20070019066).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ijms-09-02601"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ramanjulu</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bartels</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Drought- and desiccation-induced modulation of genes expression in plants</article-title><source>Plan Cell Environ</source><year>2002</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>141</fpage><lpage>151</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="b2-ijms-09-02601"><label>2.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wise</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Tunnaciliffe</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>POPP the question: What do LEA proteins do?</article-title><source>Trends Plant Sci</source><year>2004</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>13</fpage><lpage>17</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14729214</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b3-ijms-09-02601"><label>3.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Garg</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name><name><surname>Owen</surname><given-names>TG</given-names></name><name><surname>Ranwala</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>YD</given-names></name><name><surname>Kochian</surname><given-names>LV</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Trehalose accumulation in rice plants confers high tolerance levels to different abiotic stresses</article-title><source>Proc.
