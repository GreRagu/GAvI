We compared data on nosocomial infections collected during 24 months before and 60 months after implementing the new program. During the intervention period, infections per 1,000 patient-days fell 13% (p=0.002) and the percentage of hospitalized patients with nosocomial infections decreased 23% (p=0.000006). In our hospital, the percentage of patients with nosocomial infections is 43% below the U.S. rate. Our typing laboratory costs approximately $400,000 per year, a savings of $5.00 for each dollar spent.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
