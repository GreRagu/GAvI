Therefore, understandingHIV/AIDS as much as possible is the responsibility of everyhealthcare professional. In this journal review, we present thesalient ocular manifestations of HIV/AIDS, and the effect ofhighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the patternof presentation of HIV ocular disease.</p><sec sec-type=""><title>Ophthalmic Manifestations</title><sec><title>Anterior segment</title><p><bold>Holland <italic>et al</italic></bold>.

Eighteen patients (15.3%) had abnormalities associatedwith microvasculature. Forty-four patients (37.3%) hadopportunistic infection involving the eye of which 37 were thatof CMV retinitis. Seven patients (5.9%) had neuro-ophthalmicdisorders. One patient presented with proptosis due to orbitallymphoma. Four patients (3.4%) had episcleritis and threepatients (2.5%) had symptomatic dry eyes. The major causeof visual loss was ocular infections, with CMV retinitis beingmost prevalent.</p><p><bold>Ye <italic>et al</italic></bold>.

It ischaracterized by retinal vasculitis; dense, full-thickness, yellow-white lesions along vascular distribution, and hemorrhage onthe retinal surface; granular with irregular border featuredas &#x02033;cheese and ketchup retinitis&#x02033; was revealed in 12 eyes; thevitreous was mostly clear or light opaque. Late stage of theretinopathy was demonstrated in two eyes characterized asgreyish atrophic retina, sclerotic and attenuated vessels, retinalpigment epithelial (RPE) atrophy, and optic atrophy.

They noted that oculomotor disturbancesare present in HIV-1 seropositive individuals before themanifestation of marked AIDS Dementia Complex. For thisreason, and because more severe eye movement impairmentshave been observed in patients with AIDS, quantitative eyemovement studies may provide a useful neurobehavioralprocedure for characterizing and monitoring progression ofCNS involvement associated with HIV-1 infection from earlyin its course.</p><p><bold>Mansour</bold> (<italic>J Clin Neuroophthalmol 1990; 10:167-74</italic>) reviewedthe neuro-ophthalmic findings in 177 patients with AIDS orAIDS-related complex.

The overall rate of ophthalmicinvolvement was 54%. The most common finding was aperivasculitis of the peripheral retinal vessels, observed in 38%of the patients. CMV infection of the retina was diagnosed inthree patients. Isolated cotton-wool spots of the retina werenot observed. Ophthalmic herpes zoster and conjunctivalxerosis responding to vitamin A administration were eachseen in two patients. One-third of a subset of children testedfor lacrimal function had evidence of decreased tear secretion.They concluded that cotton-wool spots and CMV retinitis, themost common ocular manifestations of HIV/AIDS in adults,are much less prevalent in children. The high incidence ofperivasculitis, not observed or only seen in a few cases inother series, suggests that this ocular sign is more prevalentin African children.</p><p><bold>Girard <italic>et al</italic></bold>.

(Am J Ophthalmol. <italic>2008;145(3):397-408</italic>)observed that the introduction of HAART has markedlyreduced the incidence of CMV retinitis, but has not eliminatednew cases altogether. Current issues of importance includechoice of initial anti-CMV drugs; time at which anti-CMV drugtreatment is discontinued in patients who achieve immunerecovery; strategies for monitoring patients at risk for diseasereactivation; and management of complications (retinaldetachment, immune recovery uveitis).</p><p><bold>Nasoodi <italic>et al</italic></bold>. (Int J STD AIDS. <italic> 2008;19(1):4-11</italic>) also observedthat the advent of HAART has reduced the incidence of ocularcomplications of HIV. In the face of emerging immune recovery,conditions such as immune recovery uveitis (IRU) could affecteyes with history of opportunistic disease with a potential tocause vision loss.

Immune recovery in patients on HAARThas allowed safe discontinuation of maintenance therapy inpatients with regressed CMV retinitis and other HIV-associatedretinopathies. Immune recovery uveitis is a HAART-dependentinflammatory response that may occur in up to 63% of patientswith regressed CMV retinitis and elevated CD4 counts and isassociated with vision loss from epiretinal membrane, cataract,and CME.</p><p><bold>Garweg </bold> (<italic>Klin Monatsbl Augenheilkd. 2000;216(2):61-7</italic>)observed that since the introduction of HAART, although directinfectious destruction of tissue is less severe, inflammatoryinfiltration is augmented that may result in misinterpretation.Further, new disease entities have emerged like IRU, andCidofovir and Rifabutin induced uveitis, which involve mainlythe anterior uvea and vitreous.</p><p><bold>Whitcup <italic>et al</italic></bold>. (<italic>JAMA 2000;283(5):653-7</italic>) observed that withthe introduction of HAART, retinitis did not progress in somepatients when specific anti-CMV therapy was discontinued,but a number of patients developed substantial intraocularinflammation, which resulted in decreased visual acuity.Anterior uveitis, cataract, vitritis, CME, epiretinal membrane,and disc edema may occur in patients with CMV retinitis whoshowed HAART-associated elevation in CD4+ cell counts. SinceIRU does not occur in eyes without CMV retinitis, the ocularinflammation appears to be related to the CMV infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Immune recovery uveitis</title><p><bold>Lin <italic>et al</italic></bold>. (<italic> Ocul Immunol Inflamm. 2008;16(3):83-7</italic>) reported thatsymptomatic IRU develops in a significant number of patientswith inactive CMV retinitis following successful HAART.

(<italic>Ther Umsch. 2001;58(1):21-7</italic>) observed thatIRU is a consequence of immune reconstitution in patientswith a history of viral retinitis, which at times may beindistinguishable from reactivated retinitis.</p><p><bold>Kedhar <italic>et al</italic></bold>. (<italic>Herpes 2007;14(3):66-71</italic>) concluded that withsustained immune recovery due to HAART, discontinuationof anti-CMV therapy has been possible in many patients.Still, immune recovery does not guarantee protection fromrecurrent disease. CMV retinitis and uveitis associated withimmune recovery still remain significant causes of vision lossand demand vigilance on the part of physicians.</p><p><bold>Morrison <italic>et al</italic></bold>. (<italic> Ophthalmology 2007;114(2):334-9</italic>) evaluatedthe use of intravitreal triamcinolone (IVTA(20 mg)) for thetreatment of macular edema secondary to IRU in eight eyesof seven patients with AIDS. Visual acuity improved at alltime points and was statistically significant at the one-monthand three-month follow-up examinations. The average visualimprovement was three lines at three months. Retinal volumeand thickness improvement were statistically significant at alltime points. All patients had a minimum follow-up of ninemonths, and there was no case of CMV reactivation.</p><p><bold>Kempen <italic>et al</italic></bold>. (<italic>Ophthalmology 2006;113(4):684-94</italic>) in theirstudy noticed that among eyes of patients with immunerecovery, the prevalence of IRU is substantial. Eyes with IRUhad a high risk of additional morbidity over and above thatseen with CMV retinitis, with several-fold higher risk of CMEand epiretinal membrane. Large CMV lesions and use ofintravitreous cidofovir were risk factors for IRU.</p><p><bold>Schrier <italic>et al</italic></bold>. (<italic>Retina 2006;26(2):165-9</italic>) investigated immuneand viral contributions to the pathogenesis of IRU. Aqueousand vitreous fluids from patients with IRU, active CMV retinitis,and control (HIV-negative, noninflamed eyes) were comparedfor presence of cytokines, IL-6, IL12, and interferon gammausing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques, andCMV DNA by polymerase chain reaction. They concludedthat inflammatory IRU can be differentiated from active CMVretinitis by the presence of IL-12, less IL-6, and absence ofdetectable CMV replication.</p><p><bold>Karavellas <italic>et al</italic></bold>. (<italic>Am J Ophthalmol. 2000;130(1):57-64</italic>)performed a study to identify and describe long-term posteriorand anterior segment complications of IRU in patientswith inactive CMV retinitis who have HAART-mediatedrecovery of immune function. Persistent inflammation inIRU may lead to vision-threatening complications, such asproliferative vitreoretinopathy, posterior subcapsular cataract,and severe postoperative inflammation. They concludedthat IRU is a chronic inflammatory syndrome that mayresult in complications months to years after the onset ofinflammation.</p></sec></sec></body></article>
