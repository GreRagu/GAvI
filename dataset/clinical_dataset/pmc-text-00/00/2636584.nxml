The purpose of the present investigation was to develop protein-loaded nanoparticles using biodegradable polymer poly <sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-glycolidic acid (PLGA) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein. Despite many studies available with PLGA-based protein-loaded nanoparticles, production know-how, process parameters, protein loading, duration of protein release, narrowing polydispersity of particles have not been investigated enough to scale up manufacturing of protein-loaded nanoparticles in formulations. Different process parameters such as protein/polymer ratio, homogenizing speed during emulsifications, particle surface morphology and surface charges, particle size analysis and in-vitro protein release were investigated. The in-vitro protein release study suggests that release profile of BSA from nanoparticles could be modulated by changing protein-polymer ratios and/or by varying homogenizing speed during multiple-emulsion preparation technique. The formulation prepared with protein-polymer ratio of 1:60 at 17,500 rpm gave maximum protein-loading, minimum polydispersion with maximally sustained protein release pattern, among the prepared formulations. Decreased (10,000 rpm) or enhanced (24,000 rpm) homogenizing speeds resulted in increased polydispersion with larger particles having no better protein-loading and -release profiles in the present study.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>bovine serum albumin (BSA)</kwd><kwd>poly-<sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-glycolidic acid (PLGA)</kwd><kwd>nanoparticles</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Increasing numbers of therapeutic agents emerging from rapid growth of biotechnological research components of pharmaceutical drug discovery are macromolecules such as proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijn-3-487">Hermes and Narayani 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijn-3-487">Muller and Keck 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijn-3-487">Kavimandan et al 2006</xref>). The advances in recombinant DNA technology have ensured the easy and abundant availability of several genetically engineered regulatory and therapeutic proteins such as hormones, growth factors, vaccines, immunosuppressors and so on. However, various difficulties are encountered in formulating proteins/peptides for therapeutic uses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijn-3-487">Hermes and Narayani 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijn-3-487">Wei-Chiang 2003</xref>). Proteins cannot be readily delivered orally or through skin due to rapid degradation by proteolytic enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract and poor pass through the biological barrier, respectively. Due to short biological half-lives, repeated injections are generally needed and it is painful. Another serious problem in delivering proteins is their inherent physical and chemical instability. However, a possible solution to improve biological half-lives is the controlled delivery of proteins from biocompatible polymers. While various routes such as ocular, transdermal, nasal and buccal have been tried (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijn-3-487">Banga and Chien 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijn-3-487">Shoyele and Slowey 2006</xref>), none of these routes has proved to be a potential alternative to the invasive injection. New and/or improved methods of administration are being constantly tried. Nanoparticles are the nanosize particulate dosage forms that are being extensively tried to deliver proteins as they can protect the protein from metabolizing enzymes and can sustain the release and target specific tissues by incorporating surface ligand moieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijn-3-487">Muller and Keck 2004</xref>). PLGA is a well-characterized biodegradable polymer approved for human use by US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijn-3-487">Chun and Phuong-Truc 2008</xref>). PLGA has different varieties with different characteristics. Many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijn-3-487">Lamprecht et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijn-3-487">Qaddoumi et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijn-3-487">Bilati et al 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijn-3-487">Lee et al 2007</xref>) are available on PLGA (50:50)-based nanoparticles, however, few studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ijn-3-487">Zhu and Schwendeman 1999</xref>) have been reported with PLGA (85:15), the variety chosen in the present study. PLGA (85:15) has a molar ratio of <sc>l</sc>-lactide and glycolide, 85/15. Advantage of the lactide and glycolide copolymers is the well documented versatility in polymer properties and performance characteristics (Chohen et al 1991; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijn-3-487">Berkland et al 2001</xref>). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as model protein since it is one of the most stable and widely-used proteins for evaluating novel sustained release drug delivery system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijn-3-487">Ravi Kumar 2000</xref>). Great amount of research in the field of biodegradable microparticles and some research related to biodegradable nanoparticles, containing peptide or protein drugs have been available in the literatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijn-3-487">Panyam and Labhasetwar 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijn-3-487">Mohanraj and Chen Y 2006</xref>). However, production know-how, effects of critical parameters influencing successful protein-loading, desired protein release pattern, prolonging duration of release, stability of proteins in formulation, narrowing polydispersity of nanoparticles etc. have not been investigated enough to formulate them commercially. Rather many more studies are required to scale up them as formulations for industrial production. Under these circumstances, if we can add even a little finding to the existing scientific information, this could be valuable in real term in the development of nanoparticles, in particular and nanoscience as a whole.</p><p>The purpose of the present investigation was to develop protein (BSA)-loaded nanoparticles with biodegradable polymer, poly <sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-glycolidic acid (PLGA), using multiple emulsification (water-in-oil-in-water, w/o/w) and solvent evaporation technique and standardization of various process parameters such as protein/polymer ratio, homogenizing speed during emulsifications, particle surface morphology and surface charges, particle size analysis and in-vitro protein release to obtain nanoparticles with maximum protein-loading, minimum polydispersion with a maximally sustained protein release pattern, among the prepared formulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and poly <sc>l</sc>-lactide-co-glycolidic acid (85:15), PLGA, were procured from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Pvt.

Among the various methods available, FTIR spectroscopy provides us a distinct idea regarding interaction between various functional groups present in drug and excipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijn-3-487">Cunha-Filho et al 2007</xref>). In the present study when the FTIR spectrum of BSA, PLGA-PVA and BSA with PLGA-PVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-3-487">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-3-487">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-3-487">3</xref>) were compared, no physico-chemical interaction was detected. Hence, the polymer was used to formulate the protein.</p><p>The results of particle size analysis by laser diffraction showed that particle sizes varied from &#x0003c;50 nm to 985 nm with variable polydispersity indices among the experimental formulations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ijn-3-487">Table 2</xref>). About more than 70% particles found to have diameter below 700 nm. However, the densest and narrowest range of particle dispersion was noticed between 300 nm and 600 nm in case of formulation G4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-3-487">Figure 4</xref>), among the prepared formulations.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ijn-3-487">Table 2</xref> depicts the various process parameters of the prepared protein containing nanoparticles. Formulation G4 had the least value of the average diameter, whereas G1 had the maximum. The polydispersibility indices also showed the similar patterns of dispersibilities ie, formulation G4 had the least value and G1 had the maximum. All the formulations had negative zeta potential values varied between &#x02212;3.85 to &#x02212;4.81 mV. G4 had the value of &#x02212;4.30 mV whereas G1 had &#x02212;3.85 mV. When mobility was compared G4 had a lower mobility value of &#x02212;0.2260 as compared to that of G1, which was &#x02212;0.3022. Conductivity was found to be the highest (21.23 ms/cm) in G4 among all the experimental formulations and the least value was seen in G1, which was 10.37 ms/cm.</p><p>SEM photograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-3-487">Figure 5</xref>) shows that the prepared particles were spherical in shape and a major portion of the particle distribution was occupied by very small particles in nano range size as compared to the larger particles which were also below 1 &#x003bc;m in size. This was further confirmed by particle size analysis, which showed that size distribution varied from &#x0003c;50 nm to 985 nm range. There was a clear distribution of both the small and large particles and they were not conglomerated. Again the denser particle distribution was seen between 300 nm and 600 nm, with an average particle size 497 nm.</p><p>The average (n = 6) protein loading in G4 formulations was found to be 38.6% w/w of the formulations.</p><p>Protein release study was carried out to understand the protein release pattern from the formulations. After 10 days release of the protein was about 30% of the protein content.</p><p>When protein release study was conducted it was found that the cumulative amount of the protein release in 50 days was 83.52 &#x003bc;g per mg of formulation in case of G1. The values were 82.31, 72.35, 60.75 &#x003bc;g per mg of formulation in case of G2, G3 and G4, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-3-487">Figure 6</xref>). When the cumulative percentages of the protein release from the experimental formulations were plotted against time, it was found that about 84% protein was released in 50 days in case of the formulation G3, whereas, G4 had a release of about 42% in the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-3-487">Figure 7</xref>). G1 and G2 had a cumulative percentage release of about 61% and 77%, respectively.</p><p>From the release kinetics it was evident that formulation G1, G2 and G3 followed zero order kinetics, whereas, G4 was closest to apparent zero order kinetic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ijn-3-487">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, PLGA was selected to formulate BSA-loaded nanoparticles. Initially drug-excipient interaction study was conducted since it is an important study to determine if there is any interaction between the drug and the excipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijn-3-487">Ya-Ping 2001</xref>). Drug-excipient interaction predicts the characteristics of drug release from a formulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijn-3-487">Mukherjee et al 2005b</xref>). The level of interaction between BSA and PLGA at the level of functional groups through FTIR spectroscopy has not been reported so far in the literature. In the present experiment, the BSA-excipient interaction study was conducted with the help of FTIR spectroscopy, which is one of the latest and very powerful techniques that can indicate drug-excipient interactions among the various functional groups between the drug (protein) and the excipient molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijn-3-487">Maghraby and Ali 2007</xref>). Our data reveal that no predominant interaction existed between the protein and the excipients. Hence, PLGA and PVA were selected to formulate BSA.</p><p>Polydispersity varies from formulations to formulations. Reports have shown that the polydispersity variation existed from 100 nm to even 20 &#x003bc;m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ijn-3-487">Panyam et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijn-3-487">Qaddoumi et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijn-3-487">Han et al 2005</xref>). Variation in a range of few hundred nm is also very common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ijn-3-487">Song et al 1997</xref>). However, the denser mode of particle sizes in polydispersity range is important to compare polydispersity data with the other findings and in our study this has existed between 300 nm and 600 nm with about 70% particles below 700 nm size. Thus the finding is very encouraging in terms of less polydispersity of particle size in real terms.</p><p>Zeta potentials reported for PLGA based nanoparticles were found to vary from &#x02212;3.54 mV to &#x02212;4.04 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijn-3-487">G&#x02032;omez-Gaete et al 2007</xref>). The findings of zeta potential study are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ijn-3-487">Table 2</xref>. In the present study this value is within the range. Particles with zeta potentials more positive than +30 mV and more negative than &#x02212;30 mV are normally considered stable for colloidal dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ijn-3-487">Yue et al 2008</xref>). From the data it is evident that all the formulations are unstable in the colloidal state. This suggests that the particles should not be stored in a liquid suspension form and rather they should be stored in a lyophilized state. Immediately before the administration they should be reconstituted. Reports suggest that formulations stored in colloidal stage cause more stability problem than in the dry form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijn-3-487">Abdelwahed et al 2006</xref>).</p><p>Poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (<sc>l</sc>-histidine)-diblock copolymer is an effective excipient preserving stability of BSA-PLGA microspheres in aqueous solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijn-3-487">Kim et al 2005</xref>). PLGA degrades through acid catalyzed hydrolysis and produces carboxylic acids. Neutralizing the acidic microenvironment with the degraded PLGA microsphere system caused an improved release kinetics and stability of the encapsulated protein. Poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(<sc>l</sc>-histidine)-diblock copolymer forms an ionic complex with a negatively charged BSA with a pH range 4.9&#x02013;6.5 and being a weekly basic component it can neutralize acidic microenvironment of PLGA created by acid degradation product. PLGA coated with poloxamer (Pluronic F68) is also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijn-3-487">Santander-Ortega et al 2006</xref>) for improved stability in colloidal state.</p><p>The SEM study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-3-487">Figure 5</xref>) shows smooth and spherical shaped spheres in nano range. The average particle sizes of the formulations prepared at 10,000, 12,500, 15,000, and 17,500 rpm are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ijn-3-487">Table 2</xref>. The data suggest that with increasing homogenizing speed average diameters of particles were reduced. However, when speed of homogenization was further enhanced, it was found interestingly that the average diameters of the particles were increased again. At 24,000 rpm, the average diameter became in micron range (approximately 2.869 &#x003bc;m). Higher energy due to higher homogenizing speed might have agglomerated nanospheres immediately after formation to provide larger spherical structures due to variable surface charges or any other similar cohesive forces generated due to the high energy process.</p><p>Protein loading is found to vary due to formulation compositions, methodology, process parameters etc. PLGA (50:50) was reported to have protein loading of 8&#x02013;16% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijn-3-487">Lgartua et al 1998</xref>), which is about 2&#x02013;4 times more ie, ~38% in the experimental formulations prepared with PLGA (85:15), in the present study. Improved BSA loading was achieved in the prepared formulation G4 (38.6%) in the present study. The protein-loading studies show that with increase in speed of homogenization, the loading capacity of formulation was increased. Likewise, the increase in amount of polymer also enhanced the loading of protein. High homogenizing speed might vary the surface charges, which ultimately could load more protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijn-3-487">Basarkar et al 2007</xref>). The in-vitro protein release study was carried out for a period of 50 days. We studied a pretty long period for studying sustained release of protein. However, literature showed variable protein release study period from 35 days to 70 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ijn-3-487">Zhu and Schwendeman 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijn-3-487">Leach et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>Poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), aliphatic polyester, has been well documented for its excellent biodegradability, biocompatibility and nontoxic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijn-3-487">Loo et al 2004</xref>). PLGA varieties differ in their lactide-glycolide ratios which make PLGA varieties available in different molecular weights with variable physicochemical properties. The mechanical strength, swelling behavior, capacity to undergo hydrolysis, and subsequently the biodegradation rate are directly influenced with the lactide content of the PLGA polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijn-3-487">Jain 2000</xref>). Present study was conducted with a more uncommon PLGA (85:15) than the commonly used PLGA (50:50) variety. Lactic acid is more hydrophobic than glycolic acid and hence lactide-rich PLGA (85:15) is less hydrophilic, absorbs less water, and subsequently degrade more slowly than PLGA (50:50) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijn-3-487">Jain 2000</xref>). PLGA polymer containing lactic and glycolic acids in 85:15 ratio is hydrolyzed much slower than the PLGA (50:50) containing equal proportion of lacdide and glycolide. Molecular weight is indicative of chain length of polymers. By varying PLGA molecular weight, degradation of the polymer and the release kinetics of BSA can be controlled. Higher molecular weight of PLGA (85:15) than PLGA (50:50) due to the presence of higher lactide chain lengths enhances the hydrophobicity and decreases the degradation of the polymers and rate of protein release. In the present study, the nanoparticles containing larger particles with the increased polydispersity indices showed slower release of BSA and it might be due to longer diffusion pathways of BSA in larger particles. However, more content of PLGA (85:15) showed the slowest BSA release in G4 among the formulations studied and it might be due to the enhancement of hydrophobicity. In the present study, the protein loading shows that increase in speed of homogenization increased the loading capacity of the formulation. Likewise, the increase in amount of polymer also enhanced the loading of protein. Increased entrapment efficiency was observed for particles of PLGA (85:15) with than PLGA (50:50), for their higher molecular weight and stronger hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijn-3-487">Mittal et al 2007</xref>). Higher homogenizing speed might vary the surface charges of the polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijn-3-487">Basarkar et al 2007</xref>), which ultimately could load more protein. In a study nanoparticles based on PLGA (85:15) without drug was showed to produce less polydispersity index than those with PLGA (50:50) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijn-3-487">Mittal et al 2007</xref>). About 5% statistically nonsignificant enhancement of nanoparticle sizes with PLGA (85:15) than PLGA (50:50) was reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijn-3-487">Mittal et al 2007</xref>). This indicates that increase lactide chain may not have great influence on particle size; rather the methodology has direct impact on the size reduction. In our study, variable homogenizing speed was found to be responsible for the size of nanoparticles and their polydispersity index.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-3-487">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-3-487">Figure 7</xref> summarize the findings of in-vitro protein release study. Particles with smaller average diameter showed slower release. Smaller particles are generally formed with higher impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijn-3-487">Chen et al 2007</xref>). It varies the tortuous polymeric diffusion pathways in smaller particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ijn-3-487">Zhang et al 2004</xref>). This ultimately leads to a sustained diffusion of protein from the particles. Formulations prepared with a BSA: PLGA ratio of 1:60 showed the slowest release pattern, among the formulations studied. Thus incorporation of extra amount of hydrophobic polymer, PLGA, might have caused more tortuous polymeric networks to deliver the protein for prolonged period of time maximally, among the experimental formulations.</p><p>The method provided a narrow-ranged densely-dispersed nanoparticles having capability of release of protein (BSA) more than 50 days. Thus, by regulating different process parameters and using a very simple method, BSA-loaded nanoparticles with a low polydispersity index can be produced and improved BSA loading and prolonged release profiles of BSA can be achieved.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PLGA polymer can be used to prepare nanoparticles containing BSA or similar proteins. Narrow-ranged densely-dispersed nanoparticles having a good protein- loading capacity and slow and sustained protein release characteristics could be developed using this simple technology. From the data provided, it is evident that nanoparticles prepared at 17,500 rpm with a protein: polymer ratio of 1:60 satisfied the above criteria better than the other experimental formulations and hence it may be considered as the best among the prepared formulations, for further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The work was supported by University Grants Commission (Government of India); grant no.
