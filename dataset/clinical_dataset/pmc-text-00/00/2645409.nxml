However, the pathways involved in regulating contractility in normal and preterm labour are not fully elucidated. Our aim was to utilise a human myometrial contractility model to investigate the effect of a number of uterine specific contractility agents in this system. Therefore, we investigated the contractile response of human primary uterine smooth muscle cells or immortalised myometrial smooth muscle cells cultured within collagen lattices, to known mediators of uterine contractility, which included thrombin, the ROCK-1 inhibitor Y-27632, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory indomethacin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Cell contractility was calculated over time, with the collagen gel contraction assay, utilising human primary uterine smooth muscle cells (hUtSMCs) and immortalised myometrial smooth muscle cells (hTERT-HM): a decrease in collagen gel area equated to an increase in contractility. RNA was isolated from collagen embedded cells and gene expression changes were analysed by real time fluorescence reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy were employed to observe cell morphology and cell collagen gel interactions. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>TNF alpha increased collagen contractility in comparison to the un-stimulated collagen embedded hUtSMC cells, which was inhibited by indomethacin, while indomethacin alone significantly inhibited contraction. Thrombin augmented the contractility of uterine smooth muscle cell and hTERT-HM collagen gels, this effect was inhibited by the thrombin specific inhibitor, hirudin. Y-27632 decreased both basal and thrombin-induced collagen contractility in the hTERT-HM embedded gels. mRNA expression of the thrombin receptor, F2R was up-regulated in hUtSMCs isolated from collagen gel lattices, following thrombin-stimulated contractility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>TNF alpha and thrombin increased uterine smooth muscle cell collagen contractility while indomethacin had the opposite effect. Thrombin-induced collagen contractility resulted in F2R activation which may in part be mediated by the ROCK-1 pathway. This study established the in vitro human myometrial model as a viable method to assess the effects of a range of uterotonic or uterorelaxant agents on contractility, and also permits investigation of the complex regulatory pathways involved in mediating myometrial contractility at labour.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Preterm labour occurs in approximately 10% of pregnancies and is a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality. It accounts for approximately 75% of all neonatal problems. Despite major advances in obstetrics the rate of preterm births has not declined in 30 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. To aid the decrease in the incidence of preterm labour a greater knowledge of the pathways regulating labour is necessary. An understanding of myometrial contractility at this time would therefore assist in our biological comprehension of preterm labour.</p><p>A suitable model is essential to study the processes involved in myometrial contraction and the agents which mediate these responses. The use of <italic>in vivo </italic>studies is not ideal as the process of labour differs amongst animals, and human parturition is distinct from other mammals, so use of animal models can only give limited insight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Myometrial tissue strips have been used for tissue bath experiments, but ethical constraints and difficulties in obtaining samples limit the use of this system. Furthermore, it is often not possible to acquire enough tissue to perform adequate studies. It is also less problematic to monitor gene expression changes in this system in comparison to that in the myometrial strip sections.</p><p>Bell <italic>et al. </italic>described the formation of a 'tissue-like structure' produced by seeding fibroblasts in a collagen matrix and collagen lattices are now widely used as <italic>in vitro </italic>models for many diverse purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Collagen is an ideal substrate as it forms the main component of the extra-cellular matrix <italic>in vivo </italic>and it does not cause cytotoxicity. Furthermore, preparation of lattices can be altered to best mimic the tissue of interest. Using an isolated cell system allows study of effects on cells by individual stimuli, without interference from other sources. Type 1 collagen is widely available, so studies are not restricted in sample number. With tissue strip experiments inherent differences exist between myometrial samples whereas with this system a uniform solution of cells and collagen is used, ensuring that all replicates are comparable. Other investigators in the field of myometrial reproductive biology have utilised collagen contractility assays, Dallot <italic>et al</italic>. monitored the effects of endothelin-1 on the contractility of smooth muscle cells derived from human myometrium, used between passages 3 and 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Devost and Zingg determined the effect of oxytocin and its inhibitors on two human myometrial cell lines: one a telomerase-immortalised human myometrial cells (hTERT-C3), a subclone of hTERT-HM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the other a cell line derived from a primary culture of human myometrial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Thrombin is a serine protease that converts fibrinogen to fibrin in the coagulation cascade. It also mediates cellular events through via activation of the protease activated receptors, it is proposed that F2R is the main receptor responsible for mediating these responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It had previously been demonstrated that thrombin is responsible for stimulating myometrial contractility <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We have reported an increase in mRNA and protein expression of F2R and F2RL3 at labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Parturition is characterised by an influx of inflammatory cells into the uterus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, several proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in labour onset, including the pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin is a non-selective inhibitor of the COX 1 and 2 enzymes that catalyse the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid. It is a tocolytic agent that can delay delivery beyond 37 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The small GTPase Rho and its downstream effectors, the Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein serine/threonine kinase (ROCK) family, have been implicated in various cellular functions including vascular and smooth muscle contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Previous work from our group has established the importance of the Rho/ROCK-1 pathway in the human myometrium at labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Y-27632 is a well characterised selective inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinase 1.</p><p>Our aim was to exploit a human <italic>in vitro </italic>myometrial model to investigate the effect of known <italic>in vivo </italic>stimulators or relaxants of uterine contractility, with a future objective to assess unknown tocolytic compounds. A collagen contraction assay system using commercial human primary uterine smooth muscle cells (hUtSMCs) or immortalised human myometrial smooth muscle cells (hTERT-HM) was utilised to analyse the response to thrombin, Y-27632, TNF&#x003b1; and indomethacin. We investigated the expression of the thrombin receptor <italic>F2R</italic>, in the thrombin stimulated gels. Scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy methods were employed to observe cell morphology within the collagen gels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>Thrombin, hirudin, TNF&#x003b1;, indomethacin and rat tail collagen type I were purchased from Sigma (Dublin, Ireland). Y-27632 was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA). Stock solutions of thrombin, hirudin, TNF&#x003b1; and Y-27632 were dissolved in deionised water. A stock solution of 100 &#x003bc;M indomethacin was made in ethanol. Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), F-12 media, and foetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human primary uterine smooth muscle cells, hUtSMCs (Cambrex, Wokingham, Berkshire, UK) were expanded in DMEM high glucose with 10% FBS (Invitrogen, USA). Myometrial human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT-HM) cells kindly provided by Dr. Jennifer C. Condon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] were cultured in DMEM-F-12/10% FBS (Invitrogen, USA). HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Collagen contractility assay</title><p>Collagen gels were prepared from rat tail Type 1 collagen (Sigma, Ireland), to a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml, and seeded in 24 well culture dishes, with 150,000 hUtSMC (passages 5&#x02013;8), hTERT-HM or HEK293 cells per well, based on the technique described by Dallot <italic>et al</italic>. (4). Cells in collagen gels were allowed to equilibrate overnight in serum free DMEM medium. Gels were released from the culture dishes and various test agents of interest were added to the serum free media, inhibitors were added 30 min prior to treatment and release. The vehicle controls for thrombin, hirudin, TNF&#x003b1;, and Y-27632 were serum free media and for the indomethacin experiments it was 5% indomethacin, in serum free medium. Gel images were captured over time, using a FluorchemTM 8900 imager (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA, USA) and the area (cm<sup>2</sup>) of the gels measured using Image J software <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/"/>. For each condition, collagen contraction was determined in quadruplicate, at a minimum. Each experiment was performed at least 3 times. Results were expressed as mean gel area (cm2) &#x000b1; the standard error of the mean (SEM). 10% (vol/vol) FBS was used as a positive control for contraction in all experiments, and un-stimulated cells the negative control. The original area of the collagen gels was the area (2 cm<sup>2</sup>) of a well of a 24 well plate, before release from the sides of the wells. A decrease in gel area correlates with an increase in contractility and an increase in gel area correlates with relaxation or inhibition of contractility. Percentage increase or decrease in contractility was compared to that of the unstimulated or basal contraction. One way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc analysis, were used to statistically analyse the data (GraphPad Prism software 5, GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA), P values &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>Fluorescence microscopy was performed on hUtSMC embedded collagen gels (equilibrated overnight and 30&#x02013;105 min post release/treatment).

In this system the cells were embedded within the collagen gels like that reported by other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] using human myometrial smooth muscle cell lines, and in comparison to another study in which the cells were layered on top of pre-established collagen lattices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The cells were allowed to pre-equilibrate in collagen gels overnight for 12 hours compared to reports in which the myometrial smooth muscle cells were allowed to settle for 2 or 3 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The gel area was measured at intervals, varying from 5 minutes to 24 hours after treatment, whereas in other uterine cell studies, measurements were taken 12&#x02013;24 hours post-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This ability to modulate contraction minutes after introduction of the various compounds is not dissimilar in certain circumstances to the <italic>in vivo </italic>situation in the myometrium or indeed in the tissue bath setting where responses are quick (in some cases, minutes). As with any <italic>in vitro </italic>model it is not without its limitations, however it will be useful as an initial tool to assess a broad range of potential tocoloytic agents and may be employed as a complementary tool alongside the use of myometrial strips. The ability to monitor gene expression, the ease of use and reproducibility thus make it a suitable model of human myometrial contractility.</p><p>Elevated levels of the cytokine TNF&#x003b1;, are found in pregnancies complicated by infection and preterm labour and in normal labour in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Experimental administration of TNF&#x003b1; can induce both preterm labour and intermediate steps in the labour cascade, such as increased synthesis and decreased degradation of prostaglandins, expression of contraction-associated proteins, and increased uterine contractile activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In agreement with our data TNF&#x003b1; stimulated contractility in uterine smooth muscle and endometrial stromal cell collagen contractility models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin, clinically used to delay premature labour, inhibited collagen contraction. It reduces uterine contractions through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the uterus, and also possibly through calcium channel blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The ability of this system to monitor its effect on contractility is extremely beneficial for the testing of future tocolytic agents.</p><p>It had previously been established that thrombin enhanced myometrial contractions in human and animal myometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We reported the up-regulation in gene expression of two of its cellular receptors, <italic>F2R </italic>and <italic>F2RL3 </italic>at labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We have now determined for the first time that thrombin significantly increased both hUtSMC and hTERT-HM collagen contractility and also up-regulated gene expression of its receptor, <italic>F2R</italic>, in this system. Other investigators have described that thrombin also stimulated contraction of human lung and gingival fibroblast cells in other collagen gel systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The ROCK1 pharmacologic inhibitor, Y-27632 decreased both basal and thrombin induced contractility in this <italic>in vitro </italic>human myometrial model, which has not been previously described. This data suggests that the contractile effect of thrombin may in part be mediated by the Rho kinase pathway. Further investigation however is necessary to elucidate the mechanisms involved in thrombin mediated contractility.</p><p>The immortalised hTERT-HM cells (which are derived from human myometrium) responded to thrombin in a similar manner to the primary hUtSMC cells and therefore will be a suitable cell line for future use in this <italic>in vitro </italic>human myometrial model. The collagen embedded hTERT-HM cells are responsive to Y-27632, while hirudin and Y-27632 also modified thrombin induced contractility in this system. Furthermore, the ability to passage these cells for a much longer time than primary cells is extremely advantageous.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study established that TNF&#x003b1; and thrombin induced contractility in this human myometrial model and indomethacin decreased basal contractility. <italic>F2R </italic>mRNA was up-regulated upon thrombin stimulation of collagen contractility. Y-27632 decreased both basal and thrombin induced contractility. Therefore, it can be concluded that thrombin-induced uterine smooth muscle cell collagen contractility is mediated by F2R activation and may in part be ROCK-1 dependent. The capacity of the gels to consistently contract or relax after treatment with various uterine agents, in a similar timeframe to that in the <italic>in vivo </italic>myometrial situation highlights this as a viable method to evaluate the effects of a wide range of putative myometrial responsive compounds. The ability to isolate total RNA from the collagen cell matrix represents a chance to gain a unique insight into gene expression changes as a result of alterations in collagen contractility. Furthermore, this <italic>in vitro </italic>human myometrial model will enhance our understanding of the many complex biochemical pathways involved in contractility at labour, and possibly contribute to the development of diagnostic technologies and/or therapeutic interventions for the treatment of preterm labour, and other complications of abnormal labour.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JF performed the hUtSMC collagen contractility studies, SEM, fluorescence microscopy and hUtSMC RNA isolation.
