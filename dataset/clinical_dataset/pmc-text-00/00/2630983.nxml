As such, it became the 'bible' for many researchers starting out on investigations on this remarkable parasite, and stood the test of time for many years. Today, the volume of research articles on <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>is enormous and not surprisingly, for an edited text to provide a comprehensive and up to date resource that is representative of current developments is a tall order! The chapters on genomics and biochemistry are valuable additions, and the host assemblage chapters provide a useful resource. However, I do not feel this second edition will find its place on as many of the bookshelves of <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>researchers as did the first edition. Why? The field is moving so quickly that this new edition cannot be said to reflect the current status in some fields of <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>research. The most recent literature cited is two years old, although, I know from personal experience with edited volumes how difficult it is to ensure that the final publication is up-to-date in such a fast moving field. However, recent developments in surface receptors, the host parasite interface, developmental biology, phylogenetic affinities and how these relate to <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>'s unique biology, are given only cursory mention but are likely to dominate thinking over the next few years, which promise to be an exciting period of <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>research.</p><p>There are 20 chapters of varying length that cover the biology of the organism, genomics and biochemistry, epidemiology and transmission (via food and water), diagnosis, immune responses and clinical disease, <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>in specific host assemblages, and <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>maintenance. There is no contents page listing specific chapters and their contributors which I find most unusual in such a book, and thus it is difficult to find your way around. This is exacerbated by the type of paper used and quality of some of the figures that have been re-printed from the first edition.</p><p>This is a useful purchase for libraries but individual researchers, who have a copy of the previous edition, can be better informed by the frequent and varied reviews that have, and continue to, appear on a regular basis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Currently co-editing a conference proceedings on <italic>Giardia </italic>and <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>.</p></sec></body></article>
