These proteins convert fatty acids to corresponding adenylates, which is an intermediate of acyl-CoA-synthesizing fatty acyl-CoA ligases (FACLs). Presently, it is not evident how obligate pathogens like Mtb have evolved such new themes of functional versatility and whether the activation of fatty acids to acyl-adenylates could indeed be a general mechanism. Here, based on elucidation of the first structure of a FAAL protein and by generating loss- as well as gain-of-function mutants that interconvert FAAL and FACL activities, we demonstrate that an insertion motif dictates formation of acyl-adenylate. Since FAALs in Mtb are crucial nodes in biosynthetic network of virulent lipids, inhibitors directed against these proteins provide a unique multi-pronged approach of simultaneously disrupting several pathways.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source country="United Kingdom">Wellcome Trust : </funding-source><award-id>070010 || WT</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P8">In nature, fatty acids must be activated before they can be assimilated into various metabolic pathways. The universal mechanism of <italic>n</italic>-fatty acid activation involves conversion of fatty acids to their corresponding coenzyme A (CoASH [<bold>1</bold>])-derivatives by a family of omnipresent fatty acyl-CoA ligases (FACLs). This catalytic process occurs in two steps and involves requisite formation of an acyl-adenylate (Acyl-AMP [<bold>2</bold>]) intermediate. Recently, an alternate mechanism of fatty acid activation catalyzed by fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAALs) was established in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. FAAL proteins convert fatty acids to acyl-adenylates and do not perform the final transfer to CoASH. Instead the activated fatty acids are acylated onto the acyl carrier proteins (ACP) of polyketide synthases (PKSs) to biosynthesize lipidic metabolites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. This mode of activation is reminiscent of the adenylation domains of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>, which along with FAAL and FACL proteins constitute a large superfamily of acyl-activating enzymes (AAEs). Interestingly, the genome sequencing projects of several bacteria, fungi and plants have revealed a large number of fatty acid-activating enzymes. However, presently it is not feasible to discriminate between FAAL and FACL proteins based on their protein sequences.</p><p id="P9">Mtb is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB) in humans. Although this pathogen has been known for centuries, TB still accounts for more than two million deaths every year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>. Mtb possesses complex arsenal of virulence factors and has evolved elaborate strategies to escape host surveillance. The cell envelope of tubercle bacilli is endowed with complex lipids, many of which play an important role in its pathogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. Recent investigations of lipid biosynthesis have demonstrated that polyketide synthases (PKSs) in combination with fatty acid synthases (FASs) in Mtb synthesize unusual acyl chains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>. The coordination between FASs and PKSs is achieved by FAALs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. These proteins along with FACLs constitute 34 homologues annotated as FadD in the Mtb genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>. Emerging evidences suggest that Mtb might be utilizing FACL proteins to degrade alternate carbon sources during the latent phase of infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. FAALs in contrast are likely to be essential during the growth phase of Mtb. It is thus interesting to note that both FAAL and FACL enzymes utilize fatty acid pools but channel them towards different metabolic fates in distinct stages of Mtb life cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Structural studies of AAEs have revealed a conserved fold despite the limited sequence homology among different members<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>. This conserved fold contain a large N-terminal and a small C-terminal domain, which undergo domain movements during various steps of catalytic cycle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>. Mtb genome contains 6 adenylation domains as part of the multifunctional NRPS proteins, whereas the 34 FadD homologues (except for FAAL22 and FAAL9) are all present as independent proteins. Previous sequence-based dendrogram analysis of Mtb FadD proteins revealed two clades of FAAL and FACL enzymes. However, the molecular features which determine their biochemical functions have not been elucidated.</p><p id="P11">Our study here reveals a mechanism by which Mtb may have evolved FAAL proteins from the omnipresent FACLs. It is remarkable that FAAL proteins have retained CoA-binding pocket and this new catalytic function is generated by modifying substrate-induced conformational rearrangements. The existence of FAALs in other genomes is also demonstrated in this study. We have also developed small molecule inhibitors of these enzymes that simultaneously disrupt multiple pathways in Mtb. Our studies illustrate a novel multi-pronged approach that provides credence to the emerging &#x02018;systems pharmacology&#x02019; approach for drug discovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Analysis of FAAL and FACL specific determinants</title><p id="P12">The identification of large number of fatty acid-activating enzymes (annotated as FadD initially) in the Mtb genome was rather surprising<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>; however subsequent genome sequencing of other <italic>Actinomycetes</italic> have revealed even greater number of FadD homologues. The FadD nomenclature for these genes emerge from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> literature and stands for fatty acid degradation (gene <italic>D</italic> from this operon). Interestingly, several of the 34 FadD proteins in Mtb were recently demonstrated to be involved in biosynthesis of lipidic metabolites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. The common annotation of these Mtb homologues as FadD creates confusion and does not reflect its true function. We here propose to modify these annotations and directly refer to them as FAAL and FACL, for example FadD28 can be substituted by FAAL28 and FadD19 as FACL19.</p><p id="P13">FAAL proteins of Mtb are a group of closely related enzymes and show high sequence similarity in the range of 70 to 80 percent. Interestingly, the homology of these enzymes with other AAE proteins (FACL and adenylation domains) in Mtb is of the order of 20-30 percent. Since FAAL and FACL proteins also possess similar substrate specificity, we decided to focus our attention on these stand-alone proteins to delineate the mechanistic differences. Comparative analysis of FAAL and FACL proteins showed a striking class-specific variation in the conserved 12 residue nucleotide-binding motif (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary <bold>Fig. S1a</bold></xref> online). We decided to probe whether these amino acid changes could influence ATP [<bold>3</bold>] binding. However, mutagenic studies of this region did not change the catalytic function (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary <bold>Fig. S1b</bold></xref> online), suggesting that these residues are not determinants of FAAL function.</p><p id="P14">Since rotation about N- and C-terminal domains in AAEs are known to be correlated with catalysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, we therefore decided to investigate into the functional contributions of N- and C-domains. Towards this, three variants of N-domains (N1: 1 to 460, N2: 1 to 465 and N3: 1 to 469) and two C-domains (C1: 460 to 580 and C2: 465 to 580) of FAAL28 protein were cloned and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Biochemical assays performed with engineered N-domain proteins showed poor catalytic activity towards formation of acyl-AMP and the addition of C-domain protein in different molar ratios also did not significantly enhance the activity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary <bold>Fig. S1c</bold></xref> online). Another strategy involved generation of domain hybrids between N- and C-domains of FAAL and FACL protein. Hybrid proteins between FACL15 and FACL17 and FAAL28 and FAAL29 were constructed by splicing at a conserved A7 ST-GD motif. Enzymatic assays for the fusion proteins containing C-domain from FAAL and N-domain from FACL did not show any difference in their product profiles (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary <bold>Fig. S1d</bold></xref> online). This was surprising since the CoA-binding pocket is known to be present at the junction of N- and C-domains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>. This data suggested a surprising tentative inference that C-domains of FAAL proteins retain the CoASH binding residues and in conjunction with FACL N-terminal domains perform the complete catalytic cycle to synthesize acyl-CoA [<bold>4</bold>].</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Three-dimensional structure determination of FAAL28</title><p id="P15">Since sequence-based investigation did not provide a definitive basis for discriminating between FAAL and FACL activity, we therefore decided to solve the three-dimensional structure of one of the FAAL proteins. We obtained well diffracting crystals for FAAL N-terminal domain (1 to 460; N1), which includes most of the residues involved in the enzymatic activity and also the determinants of fatty acyl substrate specificity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>. By using multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion method, we have determined crystal structure of N1 of FAAL28 protein (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary <bold>Fig. S2</bold></xref> online). The structure reveals 3 subdomains: subdomains A and B, fold into a &#x003b1;+&#x003b2; topology and the third subdomain C into a distorted &#x003b2;-barrel topology (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary <bold>Fig. S3b</bold></xref> online). The overall fold of FAAL28 is similar to acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, adenylation domain of gramicidin NRPS (PheA)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> and LC-FACS from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> and can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 1.9&#x000c5; for 311 C&#x003b1; positions (22.3% sequence identity), 1.8 &#x000c5; for 311 C&#x003b1; positions (20.4% sequence identity) and 1.85 &#x000c5; for 288 C&#x003b1; positions (23.5% sequence identity) respectively.</p><p id="P16">Structural analysis revealed a 22 amino acid insertion (351-372) between &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 of C subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary <bold>Fig. S3</bold></xref> online). This insertion was conserved in other FAAL homologues and was absent in FACL proteins (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary <bold>Fig. S3a</bold></xref> online). In order to investigate into the functional role of this unique insertion motif, we then modeled the C-domain of FAAL28 by using coordinates from PheA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> and ACS structures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). C-terminal domain modeled based on PheA (green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) represents the acyl-AMP forming active conformation of FAALs. In this orientation, the C-domain is positioned closer to the insertion motif and could directly interact with this insertion. The C-domain modeled on the basis of ACS for the CoA-bound conformation (magenta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) is substantially away from the insertion motif towards the active site to form the acyl-CoA product. The other face of insertion motif is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with the rest of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and is unlikely to be mobile. Based on these observations we argued that the insertion motif could modulate the C-domain movements, which could in turn disrupt the second half of the catalysis to synthesize acyl-CoA.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Insertion sequence converts FACL into an FAAL</title><p id="P17">In order to verify our structure-based hypothesis, we incorporated the 22 amino acid insertion sequence from FAAL28 at the corresponding structural position in the FACL19 protein. In order to convert a FACL activity to a FAAL, the protein must actively release the acyl-adenylate. Enzymatic assays performed with this mutant protein (FACL19<bold><sub>i</sub></bold>) showed dramatic decrease in its ability to synthesize acyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Comparative kinetic analysis for the formation of acyl-CoA showed more than 25-fold increase in the K<sub>M</sub> of CoASH for the mutant protein and no significant change in K<sub>M</sub> was observed for ATP. We predicted that the conversion of FACL into a FAAL protein could be attributed to the inability of the mutant protein to generate a conformation that could bind CoASH effectively.</p><p id="P18">The comparative analysis of insertion sequences from other Mtb FAAL members did not reveal any conserved motif. Incorporation of a stretch of 15 amino acids containing Ala and Ser residues in FACL19 protein (FACL19<bold><sub>AS</sub></bold>) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary <bold>Table 1</bold></xref> online) also predominantly synthesized acyl-AMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Thus the physical presence of a polypeptide chain at this strategic position is sufficient to disable the formation of acyl-CoA. It is worthwhile to note that the FACL mutant proteins are capable of actively releasing acyl-AMP, which is an enzyme-sequestered intermediate during acyl-CoA formation. However, loss-of-function experiments could be difficult to rationalize, since these could result from secondary effects. An unambiguous proof for the importance of this insertion sequence in determining catalytic function would be to convert FAAL into FACL.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Gain-of-function in FAAL28 to synthesizes acyl-CoA</title><p id="P19">In order generate gain-of-function in FAAL scaffold, we perceived that this may require engineering a CoA-binding pocket in these proteins. Computational investigation of the CoA-binding pockets in FAALs surprisingly revealed significant conservation of CoA-binding residues (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary <bold>Fig. S4</bold></xref> online). This analysis along with the results from the domain fusion experiments suggested that FAAL proteins could indeed possess a CoA-binding pocket and that FAALs could be converted to FACLs by deleting the insertion region. Since such a deletion from FAAL28 would expose hydrophobic patches to solvent, we therefore generated a series of deletion mutants in FAAL28 by keeping in mind various secondary structural elements present in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>). The FAAL28 mutant with a deletion from 354 to 365 (FAAL28<bold><sub>&#x00394;</sub></bold>) remarkably showed capability to convert lauroyl-AMP [<bold>5</bold>] intermediate into lauroyl-CoA [<bold>6</bold>], even at 50 &#x003bc;M concentrations of CoASH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>). This engineered protein follows Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics and the k<sub>cat</sub> was estimated to be 19523 S<sup>-1</sup>. Remarkably, the catalytic rate constant for FAAL28<bold><sub>&#x00394;</sub></bold> is 85% of the wild type FACL19 protein. However, the K<sub>M</sub> for CoASH was estimated to be 10-fold higher than FACL19. This is not surprising because during the construction of FAAL28<bold><sub>&#x00394;</sub>,</bold> we have not optimized residues binding to CoASH. These studies unequivocally demonstrate that FAAL28 protein indeed possess a CoASH binding pocket. Based on these observations, we propose a model wherein the insertion motif alters the C-terminal domain movements and abrogates the second step of acyl-CoA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Recently, weak activity to synthesize aminoacyl-CoA was also reported for adenylation domains of NRPSs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Class-specific multi-target inhibitors</title><p id="P20">In combination with the structural and mechanistic understanding of FAAL proteins and the recognized importance of FAALs in biosynthesis of mycobacterial virulent lipids, we decided to develop inhibitors against these enzymes. FAALs are the key nodal points connecting FAS with different PKS systems and the inhibitors targeting multiple FAAL proteins could simultaneously disrupt many lipid biosynthetic pathways. Biochemical investigations of various FAALs and FACLs showed overlapping substrate specificity profile for 15 FAAL and FACL proteins (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary <bold>Table 2</bold></xref> online). This parallel substrate specificity provided a tempting opportunity to design small molecule inhibitors that could simultaneously target not only FAALs but also the FACL proteins. Since acyl adenylate is a reaction intermediate of FACL proteins and is a product of FAAL proteins, we hypothesized that non-hydrolyzable substrate analogues could act as a class-specific inhibitor of FAAL and FACL proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Based on these considerations three acyl-sulfamoyl (acyl-AMS) analogues of hexanoic (HAMS [<bold>7</bold>]), lauric (LAMS [<bold>8</bold>]) and arachidic (AAMS [<bold>9</bold>]) acids were synthesized (see supplementary Method online). The purity as well as identity of acyl-AMS compounds was confirmed by HPLC followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Acyl-sulfamoyl analogues have been successfully used to inhibit mechanistically related enzymes like the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>. Recently, adenylation domains from siderophore biosynthesis have also been demonstrated to be inhibited by sulfamoyl analogues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Tight binding inhibitors of FAAL and FACL enzymes</title><p id="P21">The inhibitory profile of these compounds was investigated with purified FAAL and FACL proteins by examining the enzymatic activity in presence of increasing concentrations of inhibitor. Acyl-AMS inhibition was tested with a panel of FAAL and FACL proteins and all of these proteins displayed inhibition in the nanomolar range of concentrations. The IC<sub>50</sub> (concentration of compounds required to inhibit enzymatic activity by 50%) values for FAAL28 and FACL19 estimated from dose-response curve were less than 10 times the enzyme concentration used in the assay, a characteristic feature of tight binding inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>. Since tight binding inhibitors (TBIs) cannot be analyzed by the traditional steady-state kinetic methods, the data was analyzed by using Morrison equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="FD1">Eq 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4b</xref>). LAMS inhibition was also investigated by following progress curves. As expected for TBIs, increase in inhibitor concentration led to decrease in linear phase and resulted in saturation at lower steady state velocity (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary <bold>Fig. S5a</bold></xref> online). The stability of the enzyme-inhibitor complex was further examined by performing the enzyme turnover recovery assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5b</xref>). Based on dilution experiments, poor enzymatic activity could be recovered suggesting that formation of EI* complex was not reversible.</p><p id="P22">To rule out the possibility that covalent acylation has resulted in the formation of inactive enzyme, ethyl acetate extractions were carried out with purified EI* complex. The extracted LAMS could be detected by mass spectrometry, clearly indicating that the inhibitor interacts through non-covalent interactions. Inability of dilution assays to displace enzyme-bound acyl-AMS analogues suggested binding of inhibitor in a closed binding site, probably generated through conformational changes. These induced conformational changes in the enzyme-inhibitor complex were probed by limited proteolysis experiments (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary <bold>Fig. S5c</bold></xref> online). With increasing LAMS concentration, protection against proteolysis could be observed. Similar protection against tryptic fragmentation was also observed for FACL19 protein. These experiments confirm that tight binding property of acyl-AMS arises from the binding induced conformational changes that result in the formation of dead end complex.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Effect of acyl-AMS inhibitors on Mtb growth in cultures</title><p id="P23">The potent inhibitory activity of acyl-AMS analogues with purified proteins prompted us to investigate whether these analogues will inhibit FAAL and FACL proteins under culture conditions as well. The susceptibility of mycobacteria to LAMS was assayed by following colony forming units (CFU) on plates containing various concentrations of this inhibitor. The concentration of acyl-AMS resulting in 10<sup>2</sup> reductions in colony forming unit was used as a parameter to calculate minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC<sub>99</sub>). The growth inhibition of both Mtb H37Rv and <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> mc<sup>2</sup> was estimated to be 100 &#x003bc;M and 215 &#x003bc;M respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Since FAAL proteins load starter fatty acid substrates on polyketide synthases and synthesize lipids, we analyzed lipid profiles by following the incorporation of radiolabelled acetate and propionate units at various concentrations of acyl-AMS analogues. Radio-TLC analysis showed clear decrease in biosynthesis of mycolic acids with increasing LAMS concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The higher running band in the radio-TLC correspond to the fatty acid methyl esters and display a reverse trend indicating that these inhibitors are not targeting synthesis of fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4d</xref>). <sup>14</sup>C-propionate incorporation studies facilitate investigation of lipids that are biosynthesized by utilizing methyl malonyl-CoA [<bold>10</bold>]. Here again, incubation of mycobacterial culture with LAMS decreased the amount of extractable methylated lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies also showed gross modification of the outer coat of mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>) compares the cell wall architecture of treated and untreated mycobacteria. In TEM images, the mycobacterial cells have a dense granular cytoplasm (rich in ribosomes), a thin cytoplasmic membrane, an electron dense peptidoglycan layer and an equally thick electron-transparent layer that separates the PG from the thin outer wall layer. All these components could be observed in the untreated mycobacterial cells (Panel i &#x00026; ii). This characteristic mycobacterial lipid core is not visible in the LAMS-treated bacterial cells and cells displayed irregular shape (Panel iii &#x00026; iv)</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Characterization of FAALs from other <italic>Actinomycetes</italic></title><p id="P26">Genome sequencing projects have revealed a large number of FadD homologues in several other organisms; we wanted to probe if FAAL proteins could also be identified across genera. Many of the <italic>Actinomycetes</italic> produce mycolic acids and are grouped in taxon mycolata.

Sequence analysis also indicated the presence of an insertion sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>). The enzyme from <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis was recently reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>. Towards this Rhodococcus FAAL homolog ro_4064 was cloned and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Cell-free enzymatic assays demonstrated that this enzyme could only synthesize palmitoyl-AMP and formation of palmitoyl-CoA could not be detected even at 1 mM concentration of CoASH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). It is interesting to note that all these organisms apart from utilizing mycolic acids as part of their cell envelope have also retained the novel mechanistic basis of fatty acid activation.

These proteins by activating fatty acids as acyl-adenylates redirect the metabolic flux towards biosynthesis of complex lipidic metabolites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>. The free fatty acids could either come from direct uptake mechanisms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> or by hydrolysis of acyl-CoA or acyl-ACP thioesters<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>. In this study, we delineate evolutionary relationship between FACL and FAAL proteins. Our studies show that FAAL proteins indeed possess CoASH-binding pocket and their inability to synthesize acyl-CoA manifests from the changes in domain movements. Such alteration is brought about by a novel insertion motif identified using the three-dimensional structure of an FAAL protein FAAL28. Remarkably, the inter-conversion between the catalytic functions can be achieved by mere insertion and deletion of this region. By using this criterion of an insertion motif, we show that FAAL homologues could be identified in genomes of other bacteria.</p><p id="P28">In most instances FAAL homologues are positioned next to their cognate PKS/NRPS proteins in the genomes. This conserved organization provides a dual advantage, both in terms of co-expression of the two proteins as well as in substrate channelling of the labile acyl-AMP intermediate. FAAL proteins also circumvent the need to sustain metabolic pools of fatty acyl-CoAs to produce diverse lipidic metabolites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>. The promiscuous substrate specificity of Mtb FAALs can produce spectrum of metabolites, which could be a mechanism to generate phenotypic heterogeneity in intracellular pathogens. Recently, another important fatty acid activation mechanism was characterized in phospholipid biosynthesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>. The acyl-phosphates produced in this case were generated from acyl-ACP, which by itself also functions as acyl donor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>.</p><p id="P29">Systems biology-based approaches in recent years are beginning to reveal new insights into the understanding of metabolic networks, which enables pathogens to overcome unfavourable conditions, including insults imparted by target-specific drugs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>. It is because of this reason that pharmaceutical industry is thinking beyond the traditional &#x02018;one-disease-one-drug-one-target&#x02019; paradigm and is interested to develop strategies that can simultaneously inhibit more than one target<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>. The pivotal role of several FAAL homologues in biosynthesis of virulent lipids in Mtb prompted us to develop inhibitors that would simultaneously target multiple pathways. Our studies with the bi-substrate acyl-sulfamoyl analogues, which resemble common reaction intermediate of FAAL and FACL proteins, showed dramatic effect on the cell surface architecture of Mtb. <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis indeed showed inhibitions of both FAAL and FACL proteins.
