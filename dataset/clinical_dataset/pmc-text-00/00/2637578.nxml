Evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in NAFLD initiation and progression to the more serious condition of NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis). Herein we hypothesize that mitochondrial defects induced by exposure to a HFD (high fat diet) contribute to a hypoxic state in liver and this is associated with increased protein modification by RNS (reactive nitrogen species). To test this concept, C57BL/6 mice were pair-fed a control diet and HFD containing 35% and 71% total calories (1&#x000a0;cal&#x02248;4.184&#x000a0;J) from fat respectively, for 8 or 16&#x000a0;weeks and liver hypoxia, mitochondrial bioenergetics, NO (nitric oxide)-dependent control of respiration, and 3-NT (3-nitrotyrosine), a marker of protein modification by RNS, were examined. Feeding a HFD for 16&#x000a0;weeks induced NASH-like pathology accompanied by elevated triacylglycerols, increased CYP2E1 (cytochrome P450 2E1) and iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) protein, and significantly enhanced hypoxia in the pericentral region of the liver. Mitochondria from the HFD group showed increased sensitivity to NO-dependent inhibition of respiration compared with controls. In addition, accumulation of 3-NT paralleled the hypoxia gradient <italic>in vivo</italic> and 3-NT levels were increased in mitochondrial proteins. Liver mitochondria from mice fed the HFD for 16&#x000a0;weeks exhibited depressed state 3 respiration, uncoupled respiration, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings indicate that chronic exposure to a HFD negatively affects the bioenergetics of liver mitochondria and this probably contributes to hypoxic stress and deleterious NO-dependent modification of mitochondrial proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>liver</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>non-alcoholic steatohepatitis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>CYP2E1, cytochrome P450 2E1</kwd><kwd>DAB, diaminobenzidine</kwd><kwd>DAPI, 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole</kwd><kwd>FCCP, carbonyl cyanide <italic>p</italic>-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone</kwd><kwd>HFD, high fat diet</kwd><kwd>iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase</kwd><kwd>JC-1, 5,5&#x02032;,6,6&#x02032;-tetrachloro-1,1&#x02032;,3,3&#x02032;-tetraethylbenzimidazol carbo-cyanine iodide</kwd><kwd>NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</kwd><kwd>NASH, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis</kwd><kwd>3-NT, 3-nitrotyrosine</kwd><kwd>PAPA NONOate, 1-propanamine, 3-(2-hydroxy-2-nitroso-1-propylhydrazino)</kwd><kwd>RCR, respiratory control ratio</kwd><kwd>RNS, reactive nitrogen species</kwd><kwd>ROS, reactive oxygen species</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><ref-count count="49"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), a key component of the cardiometabolic syndrome, has emerged as one of the most common aetiologies of chronic liver disease. NAFLD can progress from simple fatty liver (i.e. steatosis) to more severe conditions such as NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), and cirrhosis, if left untreated. Estimates place the prevalence of NAFLD in the general U.S.A. population at 20%, with the more severe form, NASH, present at 3&#x02013;5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Even more startling is the fact that NAFLD is present in pediatric populations, with prevalence estimated at 2&#x02013;10% among children and adolescents in the U.S.A. and Asian countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. NASH is characterized histologically by macrosteatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and pericellular fibrosis in zone 3 of the liver lobule. Insulin resistance, disrupted fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and dysregulation of adipocytokine networks are proposed to be critical factors in the development of NASH. The interaction between these factors is, however, not well understood, which has slowed progress in developing a clear molecular understanding of NASH pathogenesis. In this study, we propose that a loss in control over the regulation of oxygen supply and demand in the liver may be a major contributory factor for the initiation and progression of this complex disease pathology.</p><p>The concept that hypoxia may play a critical role in the aetiology of liver diseases is well established in other pathologies associated with steatosis. For example, Arteel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] demonstrated that chronic and acute alcohol exposure causes hypoxia in the pericentral region of the liver presumably due to increased O<sub>2</sub> consumption in response to alcohol metabolism and through the release of vasoconstrictive eicosanoids from Kupffer cells. More recently, chronic hypoxia has been implicated as a contributing factor in liver injury in response to obstructive sleep apnea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], which has also been linked to the cardiometabolic syndrome and NASH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Savransky et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] found that chronic intermittent hypoxia in combination with a HFD (high fat diet) induces inflammation and lipid peroxidation in mice, with increased steatosis observed in the hypoxia exposure group. In the present study, it was hypothesized that the interaction of hypoxia with secondary insults or &#x02018;stressors&#x02019; such as a HFD may be responsible for the progression from simple steatosis to NASH. What has not been examined, however, is whether exposure to a HFD alone is sufficient to induce liver injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, and hypoxia without the additional stressor of whole body O<sub>2</sub> deprivation.</p><p>Currently, NASH pathogenesis is proposed to occur in response to fat accumulation in hepatocytes coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction, which may be manifested by disrupted fatty acid oxidation, depressed bioenergetics and increased oxidative stress arising from enhanced generation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and RNS (reactive nitrogen species) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Indeed, one key functional change to liver mitochondria in animal models of obesity-induced fatty liver disease is the inability to maintain sufficient ATP levels. This may result from impaired electron transport and/or increased proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which dissipates the membrane potential and decreases the capacity for ATP synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Hepatic mitochondria of NASH patients exhibit para-crystalline inclusions in mega-mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], increased mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and lower respiratory complex activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Studies show that alcohol-induced fatty liver disease is also associated with depressed activity of the respiratory chain via damage to the mtDNA and ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, we have found alcohol-dependent changes in the mitochondrial proteome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and alterations in NO (nitric oxide) signalling in the mitochondrion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A role for NO in controlling O<sub>2</sub> gradients within tissues and the response to hypoxia has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These mechanisms appear to involve the interaction of NO with mitochondria, and in both the hypoxic stress associated with cardiac failure and alcohol-dependent steatosis, the respiratory chain becomes more sensitive to NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Specifically, NO-dependent inhibition of hepatic mitochondrial respiration is increased following chronic alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], whereas alterations in mitochondrial sensitivity to NO have not been examined in NAFLD or NASH.</p><p>Taken together, the results support the hypothesis that defects in mitochondrial bioenergetics play a key role in the progression from simple steatosis to the more severe condition of NASH. Herein, we propose that mitochondrial dysfunction, hypoxic stress and increased protein modifications due to increased ROS and RNS are linked and contribute to the pathophysiology of NASH. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by feeding C57BL/6 mice a HFD for 8 or 16&#x000a0;weeks and examined the bioenergetics of liver mitochondria and extent of liver hypoxia. Accordingly, studies were undertaken to determine whether the responsiveness of mitochondrial respiration to inhibition by NO was altered by chronic exposure to a HFD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Chemicals were of the highest quality available and purchased from Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich unless stated otherwise.

Currently, the most widely used models to study NAFLD are genetically altered rodent models, e.g. the obese <italic>ob/ob</italic> mouse and <italic>fa/fa</italic> rat. While these models, with defects in leptin physiology, develop severe steatosis, NASH does not occur unless animals are challenged with endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or fed a methionine/choline-deficient diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Similarly, even though wild-type mice fed a methionine/choline-deficient diet develop histologic markers of NASH, this model induces an extreme nutritional deficiency not observed in NASH patients, thus limiting mechanistic comparisons. To address this problem, Lieber et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] developed an experimental model in which rats were fed a HFD that contains 71% total calories as fat. Rats fed on this diet for 3&#x000a0;weeks developed several of the key features of NAFLD, including steatosis, inflammation, and increased CYP2E1 protein levels, whereas hepatocyte ballooning and Mallory bodies were not observed.</p><p>In the present study, we adapted this long-term HFD feeding model to C57BL/6 mice to investigate the role of hypoxia and bioenergetic defects in the development of NAFLD and NASH. In the current study, feeding mice a HFD <italic>ad libitum</italic> produces macro- and micro-steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and Mallory bodies, which are accompanied by increased liver triacylglycerol concentrations and CYP2E1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). It is likely that feeding a HFD increases CYP2E1 levels in response to elevated liver concentrations of ketones and fatty acids that serve as inducers and substrates of P450 enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Importantly, hepatic CYP2E1 levels are increased in NASH patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These observations demonstrate that feeding wild-type mice a HFD reproduces the important histologic and biochemical features observed in NASH patients, strengthening the rationale for using a self-administration (i.e. voluntary) dietary feeding approach to study the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH.</p><p>Accompanying these histologic features of NASH were significant defects in mitochondrial function. In the present study, feeding a HFD for 16&#x000a0;weeks significantly decreased mitochondrial state 3 respiration and the RCR. Cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase activity and uncoupler-stimulated respiration were also decreased by a HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These observations suggest that chronic exposure to a HFD damages mitochondria such that the rate at which mitochondria synthesize ATP via oxidative phosphorylation may be depressed, resulting in a bioenergetic defect. Importantly, our results support reports of decreased respiratory complex activities in liver biopsy samples taken from NASH patients compared with normal liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast, in liver mitochondria from <italic>ob/</italic>ob mice, state 3 respiration and respiratory control are only impaired when substrate is limited to the respiratory chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. On the basis of this, we propose that the dietary approach used in the current study more accurately models the molecular changes that occur in human disease pathogenesis.</p><p>These new findings raise an important point with regard to the need to translate what appears to be a modest change in respiratory chain function to the pathobiology of NASH. While it is apparent that the mitochondrial depolarization observed in the HFD group cannot be directly linked to a defect in cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, it is possible that alterations in mitochondrial thresholds of respiratory chain enzymes occurred in response to the metabolic stress induced by chronic exposure to a HFD. Specifically, it is likely that under conditions of pathological stress, in this instance NASH, the bioenergetic demands on mitochondria are increased for repair and detoxification, while at the same time the threshold capacity of the respiratory chain complexes is limited. In support of this concept, we and others have shown a similar decrease in state 3 respiration (approximately 25%) following chronic alcohol consumption, which is associated with the inability of mitochondria to meet the energetic demands of the tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. For example, it has been shown that decreased activity in respiratory chain complexes results in much lower ATP synthesis in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Importantly, this may be connected directly to pathology because the inability to maintain sufficient ATP levels has been linked to increased hepatocyte death when steatotic hepatocytes are placed under low O<sub>2</sub> partial pressures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It is proposed that the same holds true in the present study, as we observed increased liver injury coupled with hypoxia in the HFD group. Therefore, when ATP synthesis is depressed this would increase the susceptibility of hepatocytes to cell death, especially when ATP needs are increased acutely in the NASH patient. Moreover, this is important as a loss in the capacity for maintenance of hepatic ATP levels may ultimately predispose liver to permanent damage, due to a depression in the anabolic processes responsible for replacing damaged and/or lost cellular components.</p><p>One consequence of impaired mitochondrial functioning in the HFD group may be perturbations in the physiological O<sub>2</sub> gradient within the liver between the portal and central vein circulations leading to hypoxia. Specifically, we postulate that the inefficient mitochondria damaged by chronic exposure to a HFD will be required to have increased O<sub>2</sub> consumption <italic>in vivo</italic> to maintain adequate ATP levels in the liver tissue. Previous studies in experimental models of alcoholic fatty liver disease have shown induction of a &#x02018;hypermetabolic state&#x02019; and enhanced tissue hypoxia in response to increased O<sub>2</sub> uptake coupled to ethanol oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. By analogy, chronic exposure to a HFD can also be expected to induce a &#x02018;hypermetabolic state&#x02019; in the liver due to continued delivery of free fatty acids to damaged mitochondria. As a result of these events, damaged mitochondria and increased free fatty acid load, the O<sub>2</sub> gradient within the liver lobule would be steepened due to increased mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub> consumption in upstream periportal hepatocytes (i.e. O<sub>2</sub>-rich cells surrounding the portal vein), placing the downstream pericentral hepatocytes (i.e. O<sub>2</sub>-poor cells surrounding the central vein) under a more severe degree of hypoxia, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>An association between hypoxia and steatotic liver injury is strengthened by observations of an inverse correlation between the degree of steatosis and blood flow in the hepatic microcirculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Accordingly, as fat accumulates in the cytosol, this increases hepatocyte size (i.e. ballooning), which will reduce the size of the hepatic sinusoid and reduce blood flow, thereby rendering downstream hepatocytes hypoxic. This scenario is likely in the present study as ballooned hepatocytes were observed in the liver from HFD mice. Indeed, several studies have shown that steatotic livers have a significantly reduced tolerance to ischemia-reperfusion injury following transplantation, which can be linked to bioenergetic defects and hypoxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the interaction of the signalling molecule NO with the mitochondrial respiratory chain has been implicated as an important physiological indicator for how cells respond to hypoxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Specifically, NO reversibly inhibits mitochondrial respiration at cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase via competition with O<sub>2</sub> at the haem-binuclear center of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. It has been proposed that one function of this &#x02018;NO-cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase signalling&#x02019; interaction is to regulate O<sub>2</sub> gradients within cells and tissues via limiting O<sub>2</sub> consumption in actively respiring mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Theoretically, this would have the effect of extending O<sub>2</sub> gradients within tissues and preventing hypoxia. In the present study, we observed that NO was a more potent inhibitor of respiration in mitochondria isolated from livers of HFD-fed animals as compared with controls. Mitochondria isolated from HFD mice required 25% less NO to obtain 50% inhibition of respiration compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), which is consistent with our previous studies in the alcohol hepatotoxicity model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. On the basis of this, one might predict that this increased sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to inhibition by NO would lead to increased local O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure and concomitantly decreased hypoxia due to inhibition of mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub> consumption. However, we did not observe this, but found enhanced hypoxia in the pericentral region of liver from HFD-fed animals, presumably in response to decreased mitochondrial efficiency in damaged mitochondria.</p><p>One possible explanation for the inability of increased NO sensitivity of mitochondria to attenuate liver hypoxia during pathological states could be related to induction of additional NO targets or &#x02018;sinks&#x02019; in hepatocytes, such that NO is unable to target mitochondria and inhibit respiration even though the intrinsic sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to inhibition by NO is increased by chronic exposure to a HFD. For example, increased free fatty acid delivery to mitochondria is predicted to increase O<sub>2</sub> consumption and stimulates O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x025cf;&#x02212;</sup> production as a consequence of increased reduction of the respiratory chain complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Accordingly, increased formation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x025cf;&#x02212;</sup> in response to increased fatty acid load, impaired electron transport, and/or increased CYP2E1 in the HFD group would effectively decrease free NO concentrations in the cell via enhanced formation of ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, as shown by increased 3-NT in whole liver and within the mitochondrial compartment. This may be especially pertinent, as the distribution of 3-NT paralleled that of hypoxia in the pericentral region of the liver. Erusalimsky and Moncada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] have also suggested that one consequence of NO-mediated inhibition of respiration is to divert O<sub>2</sub> to non-mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub>-requiring targets, which themselves could be increased in response to hypoxia and/or other pathological conditions. One potential target for NO and O<sub>2</sub> may be CYP2E1, which was induced by a HFD and known to be localized to the pericentral zone of the liver. The interaction of NO with CYPs (cytochrome P450s) would result in decreased free NO concentrations and essentially block the ability of NO to increase local O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure <italic>in vivo</italic>. This concept is supported by studies demonstrating that <sc>L</sc>-arginine infusion improves hepatic microcirculation and oxyhaemoglobin status, whereas these parameters are worsened in steatotic liver when NO production is blocked by infusion of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor <italic>N</italic><sup>G</sup>-nitro-<sc>L</sc>-arginine methyl ester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Another issue of relevance to this study concerns the O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure dependence of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x025cf;&#x02212;</sup> and NO production in tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>, especially during hypoxia. Recent studies have shown that ROS/RNS generation is O<sub>2</sub> dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], but it is important to note that O<sub>2</sub> is present under conditions of hypoxia and that nitration mechanisms can arise from O<sub>2</sub>-independent mechanisms such as the metabolism of nitrite by peroxidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. There have been a number of measurements of protein modification of ROS/RNS under conditions associated with hypoxia, which can be linked to not only the generation of reactive species but also stability and turnover of the protein adducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. This concept is based on the view that there is a combination of effects that lead to the accumulation of post-translationally modified proteins by ROS/RNS-dependent mechanisms, which is supported by the present study. The key events that contribute to the accumulation of modified proteins are the increased localized production of ROS in the mitochondrion, which is enhanced as the respiratory chain complexes become more reduced and when tissue oxygenation decreases. Similarly, another critical aspect to this is that many of the ROS/RNS-metabolizing enzymes or processes are energy requiring, and their efficiency will therefore be decreased during hypoxia. Finally, the repair mechanisms that either remove specific modifications such as nitration or process damaged proteins are also energy requiring. Taken together, this combination of effects is predicted to result in a higher rate of formation of oxidized/modified proteins and a lower rate of protein turnover.</p><p>In summary, previous studies have proposed that the interaction of NO with cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase is a regulated and physiologically relevant pathway that functions to control ROS formation for redox signalling and maintain O<sub>2</sub> gradients in tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, during pathologic conditions, such as NAFLD and NASH, a loss in control of this pathway occurs in response to impaired mitochondrial function. We propose that while NO-dependent inhibition of respiration may be an adaptive and protective mechanism in healthy tissues under normoxic or mildly hypoxic conditions, this function of NO is maladaptive in pathologic conditions associated with damaged mitochondria and/or low O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Specifically, damaged mitochondria exposed to low O<sub>2</sub> will be under a greater reductive stress and it is under these conditions that the interaction of NO with mitochondria may be pathologic, because ROS and RNS formation is enhanced and ATP production is compromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, we propose that there is a failure in the ability of NO to regulate respiration <italic>in vivo</italic> when mitochondria are damaged, which results in a dysregulation of O<sub>2</sub> gradients in steatotic liver. The consequence of this is enhanced hypoxia that, when coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction, may place hepatocytes under bioenergetic and reductive stress, which contributes to the pathogenesis of liver disease in the NASH patient.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Tim R.
