Theexperiments adhered to the ARVO statement for the use ofanimals in ophthalmic and vision research. Twelve six-month-oldmale albino rabbits were used for this study, with mean bodyweight of 2.87 &#x000b1; 0.36 kg. Three study groups were formed, eachconsisted of four rabbits.</p><sec><title>Experimental filtration surgery</title><p>Full thickness filtration surgery was performed in one eyeof all rabbits in the following manner: After the rabbits wereanesthetized with intramuscular injections of xyalazinehydrochloride 5 mg/kg (Rompun, Bayer, Istanbul-Turkey)and ketamin hydrochloride 25 mg/kg (Ketalar, Eczacibasi,Istanbul-Turkey). The right eyes of the rabbits were cleanedand draped for surgery. A drop of oxybuprocain hydrochloride(Benoxinate, ThiloandCo Gmbh, Puurs-Belgium) was instilledand the traction suture was placed to the upper eyelid. A limbal-based conjunctival flap was fashioned and a full thicknessscleral block excision was carried out next to the limbus in thesuperior quadrant of all the eyes. A peripheral iridectomy wasthen performed and hemostasis was established. At this point,Interceed (TC7, Johnson and Johnson Medical Inc. Arlington,Tx, USA) and Surgicel (Surgicel Absorbable Hemostat, Johnsonand Johnson Medical Inc. Arlington, Tx, USA), preparedin 3 x 4 mm dimensions, were placed to the opened scleraof the eyes which formed Groups 1 and 2 respectively. Themembranes was draped with the conjunctival flap and leftthere. No material was applied in Group 3 (control group). Atthe end of the procedure, the conjunctiva was closed with arunning 8-0 polyglactin suture and the eyes were patched afterinstillation of ophthalmic ointment consisting of oxytetracyclinand polymyxin B sulphate. All the eyes were operated by thesame surgeon.</p></sec><sec><title>Postoperative follow-up</title><p>All groups received tobramycin and dexamethasone dropsthrice daily for 14 days. IOP, anterior chamber depth and blebappearance were checked and recorded on the first, third,seventh and 14<sup>th</sup> postoperative days. Schiotz indentationtonometer was used for IOP measurements. Anterior chamberdepth was evaluated with the help of a penlight and estimatedas Grade 0 (flat chamber), Grade I (narrow chamber) andGrade II (chamber with a normal depth). Bleb appearancewas also evaluated with inspection and graded as Grade 0 (nobleb or hardly visible non-functioning bleb), Grade I (slightlyelevated and functioning bleb) and Grade II (grossly elevatedand functioning bleb).</p></sec><sec><title>Histological preparation</title><p>Animals were sacrificed by overdose of intravenouspentobarbital anesthesia at the end of the 14<sup>th</sup> day. After theplacement of a blepharostat, a fixation suture was placed at3 mm behind the operation site, helping conjunctiva remainattached to the sclera. Square-shaped corneoscleral blocks(10 &#x000d7; 10 mm) with overlying conjunctiva were then dissectedfrom all operated eyes having the trabeculectomy site on thecenter of the samples. The blocks were immediately fixed with10% formalin and then buried in paraffin. Five-micrometerthick sections crossing the visible or estimated fistula site werecut using a microtome (Leica). The samples were stained withhematoxylin and eosin.

All counts weremade in two microscope areas and means &#x000b1; standard deviationswere used. Only clearly identified cells with their peculiarnuclear and cytoplasmic features were counted.

By the end of thisstage, a clot is formed and facilitates the movement of othercellular components into the wound. Among them, fibroblastsoriginating mostly from adjacent tissues (Tenon&#x02032;s capsule andepisclera) appear on the third day and become the dominantcellular component of the wound in the second (fibroblastic)phase. Angiogenesis immediately follows the fibroblastmigration and these two form a granulation tissue. Woundclosure is achieved by the epithelialization with the migrationand proliferation of the epithelial cells and by contraction of themyofibroblasts, which originated from fibroblasts. Contractionstarts at five to seven days and is maximally observed at thefourth to fifth weeks. Remodeling, the last phase of healingbegins during the fibroblastic phase and may last for morethan a year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></p><p>Rabbits and monkeys are the commonly used animalmodels for wound healing studies because of their suitablysized globes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> We used rabbits because they are less expensive,docile and easy to care. Filtration surgery tends to fail in animalexperiments, which indicates that the behavior of animal eyes isdifferent from that of humans. It may not be possible to achievea functioning bleb in an animal even with adjunctive therapy forwound healing modulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> So the failure of the fistula does notmean the failure of the method. Histopathological evaluation,mainly fibroblastic activity and vascular proliferation, givesus a better idea about the success. The wound healing processgenerates in a relatively short time in animals, compared to thehuman being. In the rabbit model, young fibrovascular tissuewas seen in the fistula by the third day and it peaks withinthe first two weeks after experimental glaucoma filtrationsurgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> Using this data, we selected to evaluatewound healing reaction at 14<sup>th</sup> day.</p><p>The studies about wound healing modulation after GFSare far from accessing the end point.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> One of theimportant reasons of the failure after GFS is subconjunctival adhesion.Adhesion formation in general may be reduced by severalroutes: reduction of the initial inflammatory response andsubsequent exudation (topical corticosteroids), inhibition offibroblastic proliferation (such as mitomycine-C), promotion offibrinolysis and mechanical separation of surfaces.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> The last oneis achieved by barrier agents which include mechanical barriersand viscous solutions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> The ideal barrier should be non-reactive,bioabsorbable and easy to use; also it should persist during thecritical stages of wound healing.</p><p>There is no study about the use of barrier agents to modulatethe wound healing reaction after GFS in the ophthalmicliterature. The use of barrier agents in strabismus surgerywas found controversial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> Yacobi <italic>et]al</italic>., reported that the use of ORC sleeves significantly increases the formation ofpostoperative adhesions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> However, Hwang and Changreported that the combined use of ORC, 5-fluorouracil andviscoat could delay the adjustment time after adjustablestrabismus surgery in rabbits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></p><p>The exact mechanism of action of ORC in wound healingmodulation is unknown. In spite of the fact that it is a physicalbarrier in the beginning, there is convincing data about itsbreakdown products being biologically active. Interaction of?nterceed with macrophages may result in a decreased secretionof matrix components, inflammatory mediators like interleukin-1 beta and cellular growth factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></p><p>Barrier agents are widely used in gynecologic surgery.In spite of being produced from the same material, clinicalexperience as a barrier agent is quite different with Interceedand Surgicel. As far as we know from their intraperitonealapplications, Interceed fits the requirements and it has beenapproved for clinical use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> On the other hand, Surgicel AH hasnot been even proposed as an adhesion-preventing product byits producer. There is a small number of studies which supportthe retarding effects of Surgicel on wound healing reaction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> It is also advised to remove the material after the achievementof hemostasis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> The main reason for this precaution is theunpredictable volume of the product when it is used in largeamounts. The small pieces used and the easily reachable positionof Surgicel after GFS could make this precaution unjustified.The manufacturer of surgicel notice that, during its placement,surgicel block must not overlap the wound edges. In that case,wound healig may be postphoned. We were also very carefulduring the placement since capture of the membrane betweenthe conjunctival edges might interfere with conjunctival closure.This feature makes Surgicel useful for our purpose when itpostpones the healing in the subconjunctival area and keepscompartments apart.</p><p>The most confusing point about the effects andbiodegradation behavior of these products in the GFS is thepresence of aqueous humor in the environment. Body fluidsother than whole blood showed no reaction with Surgicel AH.It could be disadvantageous if we desired only its hemostaticeffect but in our situation we hardly need any hemostasis. Inthe absence of hemorrhage, only the barrier effect of Surgicelcomes into play and helps modulation of wound healingpreventing adhesions.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> biodegradation and solubilizationof ORC was well studied for the conditions in which it isused as intraperitoneal adhesion barrier. Dimitrijevich <italic>et al</italic>.,collected peritoneal fluid, serum and urine from the rabbitson whom ORC were surgically implanted on their uterinehorns and analyzed for carbohydrate components utilizinghigh-performance liquid chromatography with pulsedamperometric detection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> They reported that oligomericproducts were evident in peritoneal fluid from the implantationsite, with no apparent accumulation in either the serum or theurine. The size and amount of products rapidly decreased andby Day 4, peritoneal lavages were free of oligomers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> <italic>In vitro</italic>solubilization was studied by the same authors and method,with the presence of serum/plasma and hydrolytic enzymes.They reported that ORC first undergoes chain shortening togive oligomers which, in the presence of plasma or serum, arefurther hydrolyzed to smaller fragments, including glucuronicacid and glucose.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></p><p>To conclude, it is not easy to talk about any significantinteraction of ORC materials with wound healing reactionwith our small study size. In spite of statistically insignificantdifferences of overall IOP and filtrating bleb, the results ofthe histopathologic examination are convincing for the futureuse of these membrane barriers in GFS. In that manner, wethought the decreased number of vessels in study groupscomparing controls may show less aggravated wound healingreaction. More studies on glaucomatous human eyes should beperformed to explore the effects of these agents.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Source of Support: Nil</p></fn><fn><p>Conflict of Interest:
