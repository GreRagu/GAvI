Closed ended and open-endedquestionnaires were used for survey of ophthalmology residentsin West Maharashtra, India. Sixty-seven out of 69 residents ofseven residency programs completed the questionnaire. On ascale of 0 (most unsatisfactory) to 4 (best), lectures with powerpoint presentation had a median score of 4, didactic lectures 2,seminar 3, case presentation 4, wet lab 3 and journal club 3.There was a discrepancy in the actual number of surgeriesperformed by the resident doctors and their perception of thenumber needed to master those surgeries. Phacoemulsificationand non-cataract surgery training was neglected in mostprograms. The residents wanted to be evaluated regularly andtaught basic ophthalmic examination, use of equipments andprocedures in greater depth.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Human resource development</kwd><kwd>medical education</kwd><kwd>methods of teaching</kwd><kwd>ophthalmic residency</kwd><kwd>students&#x02032; perspectives</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The mode and content of teaching has been a matter ofdebate amongst teachers, trainers and gurus since antiquity.Acquisition of necessary skills and knowledge is theprerequisite in practicing any demanding profession like thatof medicine. But trainers tend to focus on the knowledge givenrather than the skills and knowledge retained by the trainee(the desired outcome). The postgraduate medical educationin India follows an apprenticeship training approach ratherthan the appraisal approach common in developed countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>A survey of specialty training in ophthalmology in India in2002 had shown its strengths and weaknesses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> But it wasdirected to the heads of the ophthalmology department.The trainees&#x02032; perspective was rarely taken into account indesigning a structured teaching program. The study aimed toget a feedback of ophthalmology residents about the variousteaching methods employed in order to develop an idealresidency training program.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A questionnaire cum feedback form was circulated toophthalmology residents in West Maharashtra (Appendix 1).It had questions with rating scales about various methodsof teaching. Students were asked to gauge didactic lectures,lectures with power point presentations, seminars, journalclub, case presentations, and wet lab on a scale of 0 (mostunsatisfactory) to 4 (best). They were asked how many surgeriesthey had seen, how many they needed to assist and to performto be considered confident and trained in that technique. Thiswas followed by how many they had actually performed. Therewere open-ended questions regarding the library facilities,teaching basic techniques of examination of patient, outreachcamps, eye banking, wet laboratory and other diagnostic aids.The form was developed at the community eye care departmentof the hospital and piloted on the residents of the same institute.It was administered to the resident doctors by giving it to themand asking for the completed form after three days. If they hadnot filled it, the request was repeated after a week. The requestwas made through a social worker or a fellow resident, but wasnot directed through the department head or the postgraduateteacher. The residents were free not to put their name at theend, but had to fill in details of age, sex and number of yearsof residency completed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Sixty-nine ophthalmology residents in seven residency programswere contacted. All except two responded. Non-respondersdid not give any reason. Twenty-seven out of 67 (40.3%) weremales. The sex ratio was almost the same in all the programs.The average age was 25 years (range 22&#x02013;34 years, 95% CI 21 to29). The minimum number of residents in a program was three,and the maximum 18. The distribution of residency programswas government medical college (one), private medical college(two) tertiary private general hospital (one) and eye hospitals(three), two of them being community eye care centers.</p><p>The residents graded lectures with power point presentations(on a scale of 0 to 4) with median as 4 and didactic lectures(without power point) with median as 2. Thirty-eight out of 67(56.7%) gave the maximum 4 points to power point presentationlecture, while only 4/67 (6%) gave it for the didactic lecture. Themedian of seminar, case presentation with discussion, wet laband journal club was 3, 4, 3 and 3 respectively. Twenty-seven outof 67 (40.3%) gave full marks to the seminar. Fifty-seven out of67 (85.1%) gave the maximum points (4) for case presentation.Twenty out of 67 were unaware of wet lab facilities, but 29/47(61.7%) who were aware of it gave full marks to wet lab.Twelve (17.1%) were unaware about the journal club and threeinstitutions did not have it as a method of teaching. Twenty-seven of the 55 were aware of it (49.1%), gave the maximumpoints (4) to a journal club.</p><p>All (67/67) residents were in favor of regular objectivelystructured clinical examination (OSCE) tests or viva voceexamination. Thirty-eight out of 67 wanted to be testedevery six months, 10/67 monthly, while 4 /67 were for weeklyassessments.</p><p>All attested to the need to have better library facilities. Onlythree institutions (all eye hospitals) had more than 100 bookson ophthalmology in their library. All had internet facilitiesbut 42/67 (61.2%) of students complained of lack of access toit. Residents also desired to be taught separately to handleperimetry, B-Scan, Neodymium Yttrium Argon Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser and ultrasonic biomicroscopy. Twenty-one out of67 also wanted training to handle outreach camps. Only oneinstitution had formal training to attend eye donation calls.Thirty-two out of 67 wanted to learn more about eye donationand enucleation.</p><p>The surgeries observed and those actually performed by theresident doctors are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> along with the numberthey perceived they ought to assist and independently performto gain mastery in it. The figures are of surgeries performedby second- and third-year residents only during theirresidency tenure. Most students wanted basic ophthalmologyand refraction to be taught more with emphasis on squintand neuro-ophthalmology. They wanted more hands-onexperience in using basic diagnostic aids like 90D, 78D, indirectophthalmoscope, gonioscopy, applanation tonometry andperimetry.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The case presentation in which a resident doctor presented apatient history and examination before a professor or a tutorin the presence of other residents was the most popular formof teaching for the trainees. The discussion regarding lacunain history-taking, examination and possible investigations andmanagement that followed the presentation was consideredmost rewarding. The resident doctors were not enamoredby didactic lectures which are common in most medicalschools, especially for undergraduates and they need to besupplemented with more audio-visual aids. The &#x02032;seminar&#x02032;in which one or more resident doctors made audiovisualpresentations about a certain topic, with a tutor as facilitator,was popular. An Indian study reported that almost one-thirdof the institutions had a wet lab facility.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>The &#x02032;journal club&#x02032; in which a resident doctor summarizedor read an article from a peer-reviewed journal in presenceof a tutor and other residents was graded an average of 3.14.A structured journal club was found to be a useful tool forpractice-based learning in the US.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> An Indian study showedthat only 51/128 (41.4%) institutions subscribed to more thantwo international journals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>An Austrian study showed three-dimensional animatedteaching to be a useful adjunct to surgical videos, especiallyfor female medical students.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Virtual reality training as usedby trainee pilots has been proposed as a method to teachsurgical competence in the US.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> A three-dimensional computeranimation technology was shown to significantly increasethe quality and efficiency of education and demonstration ofcomplex topics in ophthalmology in Austria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> But only threeeye hospitals in our study had video libraries.</p><p>Though all the institutions had internet access, the majorityof the students (42/67, 61.2%) in all except two institutionscomplained about lack of adequate access. Erratic connections,limited library hours and restrictions on trainee doctors usingthe web were cited as reasons for lack of access. As moreand more information is available on the internet, this seemsparadoxical and unfortunate. None of the teaching programshad structured curriculum for basic skills like history-takingand ocular examination. The case presentation was the onlymethod of teaching to address this. These skills were supposedto have been learnt by experience and under supervision. Buta US study had reported worrisome erosion of acquired skillsof eye examination amongst their students&#x02032;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p><p>There is a huge variation in the actual number of surgeriesperformed [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. But the variation is still large even afterallowing for the exceptions. A study in 2002 had shownthat an average surgery per trainee in an institution peryear was 111 cataract surgeries, 4.8 glaucoma surgeries, 2.2squint surgeries, 4 lid surgeries, 2.2 keratoplasty and 0.8dacryocystorhinostomy surgeries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Even though there seems tobe an adequate number of surgeries being performed annuallyper student in an institution, the large range and median ofzero for most surgery types denotes the enormous differencebetween various institutions. And the resident doctors&#x02032;perceptions differ significantly from what was reportedby the heads of ophthalmology. Half the residents had notperformed any kind of surgery other than cataract surgery.The students&#x02032; expectations in the number needed to performto be considered adequately trained were not met, even afterconsidering that few had unrealistic expectations.</p><p>Non-cataract surgical training is neglected and this showsthe training program in poor light. Except two, none of theteaching programs had any emphasis on surgeries otherthan cataract. Nearly one-third of the residents enrolling forophthalmology resident programs do not graduate into eyesurgeons in the US but continue as medical ophthalmologists.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>Some are unable to improve their surgical skills even afterrepeated training for surgical skills and 12% were asked to leavethe residency. One study promotes the use of an aptitude test toassess basic surgical inclination/competence like the AmericanDental Associations Dental (Sample) Admission Test.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> A largerturnover of cases and easier acceptance of complications inthe Indian setting may be responsible for most of the trainees&#x02032;metamorphosizing into eye surgeons. Clinical audit shouldbe employed to monitor and improve surgical outcome ofophthalmology trainess.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> Preferred practice patterns put forthby the American Academy of Ophthalmology can be modifiedand used in Indian settings.</p><p>It is concluded that the residency program in ophthalmologyis not up to the expectations of postgraduate students in manyteaching centers in most of Maharashtra. A study conductedby Thomas <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that despite provision of adequateresources to funded medical colleges, their quality of residencytraining was inadequate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> The new curriculum and manualproposed by the National Board of Examination, New Delhiaddresses many of these issues. The national board has strivedto streamline and standardize postgraduate medical educationall over India. We hope that other universities in the country shallalso follow a similar pattern.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the resident doctors who responded to our query.
