However, it is unknown whether the functions of mature miRNAs can be regulated. Here we report that expression of versican 3&#x02032;UTR induces organ adhesion in transgenic mice by modulating miR-199a&#x0002a; activities. The study was initiated by the hypothesis that the non-coding 3&#x02032;UTR plays a role in the regulation of miRNA function. Transgenic mice expressing a construct harboring the 3&#x02032;UTR of versican exhibits the adhesion of organs. Computational analysis indicated that a large number of microRNAs could bind to this fragment potentially including miR-199a&#x0002a;. Expression of versican and fibronectin, two targets of miR-199a&#x0002a;, are up-regulated in transgenic mice, suggesting that the 3&#x02032;UTR binds and modulates miR-199a&#x0002a; activities, freeing mRNAs of versican and fibronectin from being repressed by miR-199a&#x0002a;. Confirmation of the binding was performed by PCR using mature miR-199a&#x0002a; as a primer and the targeting was performed by luciferase assays. Enhanced adhesion by expression of the 3&#x02032;UTR was confirmed by <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. Our results demonstrated that upon arrival in cytoplasm, miRNA activities can be modulated locally by the 3&#x02032;UTR. Our assay may be developed as sophisticated approaches for studying the mutual regulation of miRNAs and mRNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We anticipate that expression of the 3&#x02032;UTR may be an approach in the development of gene therapy.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human Genome Project identified approximately 25,000 protein-coding genes, occupying 1.9&#x00025; of total genomic DNA. The remaining DNA has come to be known as &#x0201c;junk&#x0201d; DNA or cellular detritus and was presumed to serve no particular function because it does not code proteins. Pseudogenes are part of these non-functional DNAs since they are the defective copies of the protein-coding genes. In fact, pseudogenes are nearly as abundant as the protein-coding genes and therefore appear to be an important component of the genome. It has been reported that there are approximately 20,000 putative pseudogenes in the human genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004527-Zhang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004527-Torrents1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. A large number of pseudogenes are found to be transcribed.

Nevertheless, with increased concentrations of lu-VUTR, the relative luciferase activities increased when normalized with the control construct. This suggests that higher concentrations of lu-VUTR would absorb some endogenous miRNAs and free more lu-VUTR to be expressed. To confirm this, the lu-VUTR construct was co-transfected with the 3&#x02032;UTR construct. Increased 3&#x02032;UTR concentrations generated higher levels of luciferase activities in U343 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004527-g002">Fig 2e</xref>) and U87 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004527.s003">Fig S3b</xref>).

The homeostatsis of miRNAs and miRNA-binding sites might be disrupted through changes in the expression of transcripts or miRNAs. Over-expression of the versican 3&#x02032;UTR would affect the levels of free miRNAs through binding the miRNAs, which normally regulate versican expression by targeting its 3&#x02032;UTRs. The formation of miRNA-3&#x02032;UTR transcript duplex thus decreases the functional miRNA levels. This interaction would affect protein expression, leading to the functional consequences.</p><p>Using the computation algorithm FindTar (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bio.sz.tsinghua.edu.cn/findtar">http://bio.sz.tsinghua.edu.cn/findtar</ext-link>), we found a great number of miRNAs potentially targeting the versican 3&#x02032;UTR. One of the positive miRNAs that showed interaction with the versican 3&#x02032;UTR is miR-199a&#x0002a;. Using the online search engine TargetScan4.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org">www.targetscan.org</ext-link>), we found a great number of genes that are potentially targets of miR-199a&#x0002a; including versican (Genbank access number NM_004385) and fibronectin variant 1-6 (Genbank access number NM_212482, NM_212475, NM_002026, NM_212478, NM_212476, and NM_212474).

Genomic deletion/truncation leading to translational silencing produces mutant phenotypes as the consequence of protein loss/mutation accompanied by the existence of non-coding/mutation transcripts. This strategy has been extensively used to knock-out genes of interest in studying gene functions. After gene knock-out, the protein is no longer expressed, but it is conceivable that the mutated genes are still able to produce non-coding transcripts. Sometimes, no detectable phenotypes are obtained, and it is said that the mutated/lost proteins may be compensated with others. Although compensation by other proteins is possible, the non-coding transcript may play an important role in compensation and balancing the mutant entity. Our results demonstrate a dramatic functional consequence by expressing a non-coding transcript. Exogenous expression of the 3&#x02032;UTR construct altered the expression of some proteins functionally associated with the 3&#x02032;UTR. It is possible that the 3&#x02032;UTR can play more diverse roles than the protein expressed by the same transcript, although proteins are the executants of biological activities. Therefore, while analyzing the results of gene knock-out, one may need to consider the effects of not only the proteins but also the remaining non-coding transcripts. Our results that exogenous expression of the versican 3&#x02032;UTR promoted versican expression suggest that each mRNA may exert at east two functional roles: through protein translation and miRNA regulation.</p><p>The human genome contains a large number of pseudogenes, which are nearly as abundant as the functional genes and therefore appear to be an important component in the genome. It has been reported that there are approximately 20,000 putative pseudogenes in the human genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004527-Torrents1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. A large number of pseudogenes are found to be transcribed. Analysis of chromosome 22 indicated that approximately 20&#x00025; of the pseudogenes are potentially transcribed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004527-Zheng1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Pseudogene transcription has also been reported in other species including fly, mouse, cow, and chimpanzee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004527-Balakirev1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The assumption that pseudogenes are dysfunctional is based on the fact that pseudogenes do not code for proteins. It is possible that these non-coding transcripts of the pseudogenes play important roles as modulators in miRNA functions.</p><p>It seemed that expression of the 3&#x02032;UTR produced a similar functional role as the miRNA inhibitor. However, one 3&#x02032;UTR has the capacity to modulate multiple miRNAs, while one miRNA inhibitor can only affect one miRNA. In this sense, a 3&#x02032;UTR may be able to exert diverse biological activities by modulating multiple miRNA functions. As such, an animal gene, with long sequence of the 3&#x02032;UTR, may have the capacity of exerting complex biological activities. Furthermore, a long fragment of 3&#x02032;UTR may be more stable, while the miRNA inhibitor may be readily degraded. Thus, expression of a 3&#x02032;UTR may have great advantage in modulating cell activities. In terms of stability and functionality, the 3&#x02032;UTR may be better than normal mRNA, in that a mRNA has many tasks to carry out, while a 3&#x02032;UTR may only exist for miRNA binding. In the former case, binding with multiple factors involved in protein synthesis and formation of secondary structures would decrease the accessibility for miRNAs. In the latter case, a simple 3&#x02032;UTR fragment would be much more accessible for miRNA binding. This may explain why expression of a non-coding fragment could serve as a vigorous tool and produce potent effects <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, the 3&#x02032;UTR may free a group of miRNAs that modulate mRNAs with related biological functions. Changes in miRNA regulation may improve translation of the network of related proteins, providing immediate, effective, and lasting biological effects. One could imagine that the future applications will be benefited by the application of the 3&#x02032;UTR transcript in gene therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Construct generation</title><p>To study the effect of versican 3&#x02032;UTR on cell activities, we have cloned the 3&#x02032;UTR by RT-PCR using two primers Huver-UTRNXbaI and Huver-UTRCApaI.

The slides were subsequently stained with Mayer's Hematoxylin for counter staining followed by slide mounting.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Luciferase assay</title><p>U343 cells were seeded onto 24-well tissue culture plates at a density of 3&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in DMEM containing 10&#x00025; FBS and maintained at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 hrs following the methods described by us recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004527-Wang2">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004527-Lee1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. The cells were co-transfected with the luciferase reporter constructs and the 3&#x02032;UTR construct by using Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were then collected by trypsin and lysed with a luciferase specific lysis buffer from Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega). Cells were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were transferred into a black 96-well plate (3&#x000d7;10 &#x000b5;l) for luciferase activity measurement and into a transparent 96-well plate (3&#x000d7;50 &#x000b5;l) for &#x003b2;-gal activity determination. For the luciferase activity measurement, 70 &#x000b5;l of luciferase assay reagent was added into each well and the luciferase activity was detected by using microplate scintillation and luminescence counter (Packard, Perkin Elmer). For the internal control of &#x003b2;-gal activities, 90 &#x000b5;l of assay reagent (4 mg/ml ONPG, 0.5 M MgSO<sub>4</sub>, &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and 0.4 M sodium phosphate buffer) were added into each well. The plate was then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 60 min. The absorbance at 410 nm was measured by using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.).</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The results (mean values&#x000b1;SD) of all the experiments were subjected to statistical analysis by <italic>t</italic>-test.

The luciferase activities of lu-VUTR never reached the levels of the control, suggesting endogenous miRNAs targeting the versican 3&#x02032;UTR. Nevertheless, the activities increased with higher does of plasmids, suggesting that increased supplies of versican 3&#x02032;UTR absorbed some endogenous miRNAs freeing luciferase translation.
