Therapeutic antibodies fully lacking the core fucose of the Fc oligosaccharides have been found to exhibit much higher ADCC in humans than their fucosylated counterparts. However, data which show how fully non-fucosylated antibodies achieve such a high ADCC in human whole blood have not yet been disclosed. The precise mechanisms responsible for the high ADCC mediated by fully non-fucosylated therapeutic antibodies, even in the presence of human plasma, should be explained based on direct evidence of non-fucosylated antibody action in human blood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Using a human <italic>ex vivo </italic>B-cell depletion assay with non-fucosylated and fucosylated anti-CD20 IgG1s rituximab, we monitored the binding of the therapeutic agents both to antigens on target cells (target side interaction) and to leukocyte receptors (Fc&#x003b3;R) on effector cells (effector side interaction), comparing the intensities of ADCC in human blood.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the target side interaction, down-modulation of CD20 on B cells mediated by anti-CD20 was not observed. Simple competition for binding to the antigens on target B cells between fucosylated and non-fucosylated anti-CD20s was detected in human blood to cause inhibition of the enhanced ADCC of non-fucosylated anti-CD20 by fucosylated anti-CD20. In the effector side interaction, non-fucosylated anti-CD20 showed sufficiently high Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa binding activity to overcome competition from plasma IgG for binding to Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa on natural killer (NK) cells, whereas the binding of fucosylated anti-CD20 to Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa was almost abolished in the presence of human plasma and failed to recruit NK cells effectively. The core fucosylation levels of individual serum IgG1 from healthy donors was found to be so slightly different that it did not affect the inhibitory effect on the ADCC of fucosylated anti-CD20.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that removal of fucosylated antibody ingredients from antibody therapeutics elicits high ADCC in human blood by two mechanisms: namely, by evading the inhibitory effects both of plasma IgG on Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa binding (effector side interaction) and of fucosylated antibodies on antigen binding (target side interaction).</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The clinical successes of therapeutic antibodies have been demonstrated by improvement of overall survival and time to disease progression in various types of malignant diseases, such as breast, colon, and hematological cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As molecular-targeted therapeutics, therapeutic antibodies that bind to specific cell-surface antigens on target cells can induce cytotoxicity via the effector functions of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) through the constant region of the antibody (Fc), and apoptosis of target cells directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recently, some clinical evidence based on genetic analysis of leukocyte receptor (Fc&#x003b3;R) polymorphisms of cancer patients treated with anti-CD20 IgG1 rituximab and anti-HER2 IgG1 trastuzumab therapies has revealed that ADCC is one of the critical mechanisms responsible for the clinical efficacy of these therapeutic antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A significant correlation has also been reported between the clinical responses to the therapies and the low-affinity Fc&#x003b3;R polymorphisms in rituximab-treated patients of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, in Crohn's disease patients treated with anti-TNF-&#x003b1; IgG1 infliximab, and in pregnant women with fetal hemolytic disease treated with anti-RhD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Hence, ADCC enhancement technology is expected to play a key role in the development of therapeutic antibodies with improved clinical efficacy. Indeed, a number of preclinical and clinical trials using such non-fucosylated antibody therapeutics are now underway.</p><p>Although various therapeutic antibodies confer great benefits to patients, they also present serious issues of cost-effective performance; as it has been pointed out, some of the currently approved therapeutic antibodies are unable to induce more than remission of cancer despite the fairly high cost of the therapy. Recently, the inhibition of therapeutic-antibody ADCC by plasma IgG, probably through competition for binding of the therapeutics to Fc&#x003b3;R on effector cells, is found to be at least partly responsible for the large dose requirement in antibody therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. On the other hand, fully non-fucosylated anti-CD20 rituximab is shown to exhibit strong ADCC at lower concentrations (10 to 100 ng/mL) with much higher efficacy than that of its fucosylated counterparts, even in the presence of plasma IgG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, the basic data elucidating how fully non-fucosylated antibodies show such a high ADCC in human whole blood have not yet been disclosed. The precise mechanisms responsible for the high ADCC mediated by fully non-fucosylated therapeutic antibodies, even in the presence of human plasma, should be explained based on direct evidence of non-fucosylated antibody action in human blood. Understanding the behavioral differences between non-fucosylated and fucosylated therapeutic antibodies in human blood can provide a new clue for improving antibody therapies.</p><p>In this study, we explored the mechanisms by which non-fucosylated therapeutic antibodies induce much higher ADCC in human blood than do fucosylated therapeutics. As a model of human <italic>in vivo</italic>, we employed a human B-cell depletion assay with anti-CD20 IgG1 rituximab, and focused on the actual binding to the two key cellular components of effector and target cells in human blood: namely, the binding through Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa to natural killer (NK) cells (effector side interaction) and the binding through the antigen to target cells (target side interaction).

In this assay, fucosylated or non-fucosylated anti-CD20 (1 &#x003bc;g/mL) was employed as an ADCC inducer against target B cells, and B-cell depletion mediated by the ADCC was measured by flow cytometry. The ADCC of anti-CD20s was inhibited by autologous plasma (greatly in fucosylated and slightly in non-fucosylated anti-CD20s) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>). However, in the absence of plasma, fucosylated anti-CD20 showed quite high ADCC (exceeding 40% cytotoxicity) compared with the case in the presence of plasma, and this value was fairly close to that of non-fucosylated anti-CD20. Next, we focused on whether or not individual differences in endogenous human plasma modulate the inhibitory effects on ADCC induced by fucosylated anti-CD20 (1 &#x003bc;g/mL) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b, c, d</xref>, donor 8). Human sera from 12 healthy individuals were employed; the individual sera themselves were confirmed not to show any detectable cytotoxic activity against human B cells in this experiment. Although the 12 individual sera displayed slight differences in terms of IgG1 concentration (5.3 to 7.5 mg/mL) and the relative amount of non-fucosylated Fc oligosaccharides (1.2 to 6.5%), consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], the intensity of inhibitory activity of individual serum against the ADCC of fucosylated anti-CD20 did not significantly correlate with these differences.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Influence of human plasma on ADCC activity of fucosylated anti-CD20</bold>.

In order to develop fully non-fucosylated therapeutic antibodies as new medicine, the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the antibodies should be elucidated: how fully non-fucosylated antibodies effectively mediate two key cellular component interactions of effector and target cells to exercise high ADCC and what the differences are between non-fucosylated and fucosylated antibodies in these actions. In this study, we addressed non-fucosylated antibody actions in human blood.</p><p>Firstly, we were surprised that the binding of fucosylated antibodies to NK cells was not detected, even at the high concentration of 30 &#x003bc;g/mL, in the presence of human plasma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). A common feature of the antibody therapies against cancers is that their anti-tumor efficacies typically require weekly administration of a high dose (2&#x02013;8 mg/kg) over several months to maintain effective serum concentrations exceeding 10 &#x003bc;g/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, it is realized that currently-licensed therapeutic antibodies mostly do not bind to NK cells in human blood after administration. On the other hand, the binding of antibodies to target cells was detected at a concentration of 3.3 &#x003bc;g/mL, irrespective of the presence of human plasma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The antigen binding of therapeutic antibodies to target cells appears to be simply determined by their specificity and affinity. In current antibody therapies, administered therapeutic antibodies seem to have sufficient capability to concentrate in the target cells accessible from the bloodstream, but not to capture effector cells in the target sites effectively.</p><p>We confirmed the inhibitory effects of human serum IgG on the ADCC of therapeutic antibodies, consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. ADCC of fucosylated antibodies was significantly affected by human plasma IgG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>). In contrast, non-fucosylated antibodies showed much stronger binding to Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa on NK cells, even in the presence of human plasma IgG, resulting in much higher potency and efficacy of non-fucosylated compared to fucosylated antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). In our experiments, the concentrations of therapeutic antibodies required for inducing <italic>ex vivo </italic>ADCC and binding to Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa on NK cells were not necessarily consistent. This discrepancy seemed to reflect the fact that human serum IgG bound to Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa on NK cells might be more effectively displaced by therapeutic antibodies bound to the surface of target cells than unbound forms, possibly due to an avidity effect via formation of a polyvalent Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa-binding matrix, and consequently promoting recruitment of NK cells. Interestingly, a triple amino acid-substituted mutant (S239D/S298A/I332E) showed almost identical <italic>ex vivo </italic>ADCC and NK cell binding to that of the non-fucosylated wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), although the mutant was shown to have higher affinity than the non-fucosylated wild type for recombinant Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The binding affinity estimated by solid-phase assay with recombinant protein forms might not necessarily be the same as the affinity to the native structure forms on the cell surface; thus, the equivalency in anti-CD20 efficacy was observed.</p><p>Before starting these experiments, we speculated that the concentration of human plasma IgG1 is so huge that its fucosylation level might affect the inhibitory activity of ADCC induced by therapeutic antibodies, even though the proportion of non-fucosylated IgG1 is very low. Indeed, human plasma contains 5 mg/mL of endogenous IgG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], which is approximately 100-fold higher than the serum trough concentration of rituximab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, contrary to our speculation, we could not detect any significant difference caused by variations in serum IgG1 fucosylation levels in healthy individuals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) although individual human serum IgG1 from 12 healthy donors showed slight variations in the concentration (5.3 to 7.5 mg/mL) and the content of non-fucosylated oligosaccharide structures (1.2 to 6.5%). Factors other than endogenous IgG1 concentration and fucosylation levels, such as variations of other endogenous IgG subclasses, might also be involved in the ADCC inhibitory activity of human serum IgG from healthy individuals. Some leukemia patients are reported to increase their relative levels of non-fucosylated Fc oligosaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It is still thought to be interesting to explore whether individual patient variations in endogenous IgG1 fucosylation level might affect the efficacy of antibody therapies.</p><p>We also confirmed that enhanced <italic>ex vivo </italic>ADCC of non-fucosylated therapeutic antibodies is inhibited by their fucosylated counterparts, consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In our experiments, down-modulation of CD20 antigen on B cells mediated by anti-CD20 was not observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), and simple competition for binding to the antigens on target B cells between fucosylated and non-fucosylated anti-CD20s was detected in human blood (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), resulting in inhibition of the enhanced ADCC of non-fucosylated anti-CD20 by fucosylated anti-CD20. Thus, the mechanism by which ADCC induced by non-fucosylated antibodies is inhibited by fucosylated forms is mainly through competition of the two forms for the antigens on target cells. In other words, the density of the non-fucosylated form on the target cells is reduced by fucosylated form occupation, which causes an effect to shed the target antigens from capture by the therapeutic agent having high ADCC activity even in plasma. To overcome interference from human plasma IgG and recruit NK cells to the target cells effectively, the key is to coat the target cells with therapeutic agents having higher binding affinity to Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa than plasma IgG, such as fully non-fucosylated IgG1. The non-fucosylated form of IgG1 is a natural component in human serum IgG, and is also observed as a trace ingredient in currently-licensed therapeutic antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. It will be great benefits for patients if the proportion of the non-fucosylated form is increased in antibody therapeutics.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that removal of fucosylated antibody ingredients from antibody therapeutics elicits high ADCC, even in human blood, via two mechanisms: namely, by evading the inhibitory effects both of plasma IgG on the binding of Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa on NK cells and of fucosylated counterparts on the binding of the antigen on target cells. Thus, antibody therapy consisting of fully non-fucosylated IgG1, not including the fucosylated form, is worth to apply as next-generation antibody therapy with improved efficacy at a reduced dose for patients, which will have a great impact especially on human cancer therapy based on the ADCC mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SI designed the study; participated in the purification and the biological activity analysis of the antibodies; carried out the <italic>ex vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>ADCC assays; and drafted the manuscript.
