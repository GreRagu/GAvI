As a consequence, signals must travel from their origin to distal locations. Much is understood about the purely diffusive propagation of signals through space. Many signals, however, propagate via signaling cascades.

Cascades operating far from enzyme saturation speed up signal propagation; the second mobile species moves more quickly than the first through space, on average. The enhanced speed is due to more efficient serial activation of a downstream signaling module (by the signaling molecule immediately upstream in the cascade) at points distal from the signaling origin, compared to locations closer to the source. Conversely, cascades operating under saturated kinetics, which exhibit zero-order ultrasensitivity, can slow down signals, ultimately localizing them to regions around the origin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Signal speed modulation may be a fundamental function of cascades, affecting the ability of signals to penetrate within a cell, to cross-react with other signals, and to activate distant targets. In particular, enhanced speeds provide a way to increase signal penetration into a cell without needing to flood the cell with large numbers of active signaling molecules; conversely, diminished speeds in zero-order ultrasensitive cascades facilitate strong, but localized, signaling.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signaling cascades, series of molecules that sequentially activate each other, are ubiquitous in cellular systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004639-Alberts1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004639-Lamb1">4</xref>.

Much of this work has focused on the long time behavior of spatially inhomogeneous systems or on the kinetics of particular pathways. In the latter case, for example, many studies have focused on the MAPK cascade, a ubiquitous cellular pathway. The MAPK cascade has been shown to enhance signal penetration into the cell, reducing sharp signaling gradients otherwise caused by phosphatase deactivation of the signal as it travels away from the origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004639-Kholodenko1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004639-Naka1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. However, according to these studies, simple kinetic considerations do not account for how the cascade enables penetration from the membrane to the nucleus.

In particular, cascades operating far from saturation can speed signal propagation through the cell. Although phosphatase levels modulating certain kinase cascades have been suggested to be too large for signal penetration into the nucleus, our results may be applicable to kinase cascades over shorter length scales or to other cascaded signaling modules.

In particular, the common model collapses to our model if the activation of the first mobile messenger is fast compared to its diffusion time and the reaction time scale.

In this respect, it measures the significance of the primary signal's localization.

Furthermore, the cascade's effect on the speed of the signal is independent of its effect on the overall amplitude of the signal: the amplitude can be independently controlled by altering the initial, inactive concentration of the secondary signal, c<sub>A0</sub>, which does not affect the signal speed. The enhancement of signal speed is negligible when the Damkohler number is negligible (e.g. for fast diffusion or weak primary signals) and increases as the Damkohler number increases. The seemingly linear increase of the secondary signal's mean squared displacement with time admits the possibility of an effective diffusivity.</p><p>Both the increased speed of the secondary signal and its dependence on the Damkohler number can be understood by considering the effects of signal localization on serial triggering. Primary signaling molecules initially localized to the origin must compete with each other there to activate a limited amount of secondary signal, constraining any individual molecule's ability to serially activate many secondary signaling molecules. Primary signaling molecules that diffuse away from the origin, on the other hand, encounter less competition and can more readily serially activate many molecules. Serial triggering is enhanced far from the origin, and the distribution of the secondary signal is shifted to greater distances than the primary signal. In the context of signal speed, the result is that the secondary signal moves faster than its predecessor. For example, if the reaction is instantaneous relative to diffusion (<italic>Da&#x0226b;1</italic>), the secondary signal becomes fully activated wherever there is at least one molecule of the primary signal &#x02013; potentially quite far from the origin and certainly further at any given time than the primary signal, on average.</p><p>Our results also suggest that the greater the disparity between serial triggering at the origin and far away, the greater the enhancement in the signal's speed. Specifically, the speed increases with the Damkohler number, which measures the importance of a signal's localization. When the Damkohler number is high, the primary signal attempts to react before it diffuses away from the origin, and near the origin, its ability to serially trigger is limited.</p><p>There are several implications for these results. Directly, by examining the contributions to the Damkohler number, our results suggest that one effect of strongly stimulating a primary signal (increasing <italic>N<sub>S0</sub></italic>) is to generate a quickly moving, not just stronger, secondary signal.</p><p>Our results also clarify previous work indicating that cascades help signals penetrate into a cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004639-Kholodenko1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004639-Naka1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, we note that one way cascades help signal penetration is by increasing signal speed. This effect is independent from any overall amplification of the primary signal, which would also contribute to increased penetration. In particular, because of the increased speed, a cascade can help a signal penetrate deep into a cell even if it attenuates the overall level of the signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004639-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

These molecules homogenously deactivate the primary and secondary signals.

Consistent with our previous results, however, the secondary signal still moves faster than the primary signal.</p><fig id="pone-0004639-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004639.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Effect of phosphatases deactivating the secondary signal.</title><p>The curves indicate the mean squared displacement of the secondary signal for <italic>Da&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10</italic> and various values of the parameter <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>.

We find, consistent with our previous results, that active signaling molecules at all levels of a cascade travel faster than the primary signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004639-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, the same basic features that govern signal speed in a one level cascade seem to govern the speeds at each level in a multi-level cascade. In general, any given step in a multi-level cascade is just a one level cascade in which the primary signal is no longer a simple Gaussian. The language of localization developed above for a Gaussian input, for which the diffusion and reaction time scales determine differences in serial triggering near and far from the origin, broadly translates to multi-level cascades, as suggested by the simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004639-g005">Figure 5</xref>. If the localization at one level is significant, the next level moves quickly relative to pure diffusion; otherwise, the next level moves almost diffusively. Practically, the consequence for multilevel cascades is that, if signals in the cascade become more and more localized down the chain (e.g. the cascade amplifies signal amplitude, reducing reaction times), the signal travels more and more quickly; if the signals become less localized (e.g. the cascade attenuates signal amplitude), the speeds tend toward pure diffusion.</p><fig id="pone-0004639-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004639.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Signal propagation in a multi-level cascade.</title><p>The cascade ordering is S, A, B, C, with each species activating the species after it in the chain.

In many contexts, the primary mobile signal in a cascade is activated over time by a permanently localized predecessor (e.g. one bound to the membrane). To investigate the consequence of this, we considered a model in which the primary mobile signal is generated at the origin at some constant rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004639-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Consistent with our previous results, the secondary signal travels faster than the primary signal. In addition, we investigated a more detailed model in which the primary mobile signal, initially inactive and homogenously distributed, is activated by a signal on the membrane that decays exponentially over time (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004639.s002">Figure S1a</xref>). Again, the secondary mobile signal travels faster than its predecessor. Furthermore, if the membrane-bound signal decays rapidly, quickly activating the primary signal, the results coincide with those of our simple model (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004639.s002">Figure S1b</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004639-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004639.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Effect of generating the primary signal at a constant rate at the origin.</title><p>The results are parameterized by a Damkohler number equal to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0004639.e012.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>R</italic> is the rate of generation at the origin.

In certain parameter regimes &#x02013; fast diffusion, slow reaction, strong phosphatases, or weak signals &#x02013; the difference can be negligible. The kinetics, however, admit the phenomena. In biological systems, in which crowded environments slow down diffusion relative to reaction and phosphatase recruitment is often delayed, the effects we have described are likely to be relevant.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Cascades operating under zero-order ultrasensitivity lead to signal localization</title><p>Cascades operating under the kinetics of Equation 3 exhibit behavior known as zero-order ultrasensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004639-Goldbeter1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>: in homogenous systems, the secondary signal is either completely activated or left inactive depending on whether the primary signal exceeds the threshold, <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>.</p><p>Numerical solutions for the propagation speed of the secondary signal under these kinetics are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004639-g008">Figure 8</xref> for various values of the Damkohler number.

In this limiting case, a sharp boundary exists between the complete activation of the secondary signal near the origin, where the primary signal exceeds the threshold, and its complete inactivity further away. The secondary signal's mean squared displacement can then be estimated by tracking this threshold concentration in the Gaussian distribution describing the primary signal. Note that the Damkohler number does not appear in Equation 6 as in this approximation it has been assumed to be infinite for the limiting case.</p><p>As indicated by the numerical simulations and by the approximate solution, cascades operating under zero-order ultrasensitivity can both speed up a signal (at early times) and slow it down (at later times). Eventually, the primary signal is nowhere above the threshold and the secondary signal, after contracting, entirely disappears. Similar to our results in the previous section, when the Damkohler number is small, diffusion dominates and the corrections to pure diffusive motion disappear.</p><p>Because the overall concentration of the inactive secondary signal (<italic>c<sub>A0</sub></italic>) appears in the Damkohler number, the signal propagation speed is no longer completely decoupled from the amplification effects of the cascade. In particular, any attempt to drastically amplify the primary signal will promote purely diffusive motion of the secondary signal, because the system's tendency to remove sharp gradients washes out all other effects. The speed and signal amplitude are still independent in the important sense that the signal can be slowed down independently of whether it is also amplified or attenuated, depending on the parameters.</p><p>These results have several implications. Like the cascades studied in the previous section, zero-order ultrasensitive cascades can be used to speed up signal propagation. A unique feature of these cascades, however, is that they can also slow down signal propagation, eventually confining the secondary signal to a region around the signaling origin and preventing it from reaching any distant targets or interacting with distant signals. The confinement is accomplished purely by the kinetics of the reactions. The region to which the signal is confined, corresponding to the maximum possible mean squared displacement of the secondary signal, can be approximated as:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004639.e014.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula></p><p>As expected, phosphatases shrink the region over which the signal can propagate.</p><p>Because they can slow down signal propagation in space without necessarily attenuating a signal, cascades under the kinetics of Equation 3 provide a way for generating strong signals without promoting cross-reactivity with distant signals or interference with distant targets. Other simple mechanisms do not simultaneously localize and amplify the signal. For example, a strongly stimulated, uncascaded signal would necessarily lead to increased penetration and interference within the cell; a signal localized solely by strong phosphatase activity would be commensurately weakened.</p><p>We investigated our simplification that the primary signal enters the system instantaneously as a bolus. If, instead, the primary signal is generated at a constant rate at the origin, the secondary signal moves more slowly than the primary signal at early times and moves more quickly at later times, a temporal order that is opposite that of the original result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004639-g009">Figure 9</xref>). If, additionally, phosphatases are added to the system to deactivate the primary signal, the mean squared displacements eventually plateau as a steady state is reached between generation and destruction of the primary signal (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004639.s003">Figure S2</xref>). At long times, the secondary signal will either be more or less localized than the primary signal depending on whether the steady state is reached while the secondary signal moves slower or faster than the primary signal. If the phosphatases are strong and the system quickly reaches steady state, the secondary signal remains more localized than the primary signal; otherwise, it remains less localized. Given that the novel feature of cascades operating under zero-order ultrasensitivity is that they can slow down signal propagation, the relevance of our results in these modified models depends on whether the early period of slowing down is long compared to other signaling processes, such as phosphatase deactivation of the primary signal.</p><fig id="pone-0004639-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004639.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Effect of generating the primary signal continuously at the origin.</title><p>The results are parameterized by <italic>&#x003b3;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;Dk<sub>p</sub>c<sub>p</sub>/(kRL<sup>2</sup>)</italic>, where <italic>R</italic> is the rate of formation of the primary signal at the origin (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004639.s002">Text S1</xref>).
