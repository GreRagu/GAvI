This study quantified the proportion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced differentially expressed monocyte genes that could be measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and determined the extent to which gene expression in the non-monocyte cell fraction diluted or obscured fold changes that could be detected in the cell mixture.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p> Human PBMC were stimulated with LPS, and monocytes were then isolated by positive (Mono&#x0002b;) or negative (Mono&#x02212;) selection. The non-monocyte cell fraction (MonoD) remaining after positive selection of monocytes was used to determine the effect of non-monocyte cells on overall expression. RNA from LPS-stimulated PBMC, Mono&#x0002b;, Mono&#x02212; and MonoD samples was co-hybridised with unstimulated RNA for each cell type on oligonucleotide microarrays. There was a positive correlation in gene expression between PBMC and both Mono&#x0002b; (0.77) and Mono&#x02212; (0.61&#x02013;0.67) samples. Analysis of individual genes that were differentially expressed in Mono&#x0002b; and Mono&#x02212; samples showed that the ability to detect expression of some genes was similar when analysing PBMC, but for others, differential expression was either not detected or changed in the opposite direction. As a result of the dilutional or obscuring effect of gene expression in non-monocyte cells, overall about half of the statistically significant LPS-induced changes in gene expression in monocytes were not detected in PBMC. However, 97&#x00025; of genes with a four fold or greater change in expression in monocytes after LPS stimulation, and almost all (96&#x02013;100&#x00025;) of the top 100 most differentially expressed monocyte genes were detected in PBMC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The effect of non-responding cells in a mixture dilutes or obscures the detection of subtle changes in gene expression in an individual cell type.

Specifically, significant changes of gene expression in the cell type of interest may be undetectable as a result of the dilutional effect of a majority of non-responding cells or obscured by opposite responses in other cell types. In addition, it is impossible to attribute observed differential expression to individual cell types.</p><p>This study compared gene expression in PBMC with expression in monocytes alone after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a paradigm for determining the extent to which changes in gene expression in a particular cell type can be detected in a cell mixture.

Analysis was undertaken in monocytes isolated by both positive and negative selection to control for possible gene expression induced by CD14-mediated pathways.

The proportion of LPS-induced differentially expressed monocyte genes that can be detected in PBMC was successfully quantified.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Global gene expression in LPS-stimulated PBMC from two individuals was compared to expression in monocytes isolated from the same blood sample.

Duplicate PBMC samples (PBMC1 and PBMC2) were stimulated in parallel for 3 and 24 hours to estimate the variability between independent stimulations of the same cell population. The PBMC and monocyte samples were compared to the non-monocyte cell fraction remaining after positive isolation (MonoD), comprising PBMC depleted of Mono&#x0002b; cells, to analyse the effect of the non-monocyte cells in the mixture on gene expression.</p><p>The proportion of monocytes in the PBMC samples was 10&#x02013;14&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004427-t001">table 1</xref>).

A further 471 genes were differentially expressed after LPS stimulation in PBMC but not in the Mono&#x0002b; sample.

Conversely, expression of this gene was significantly downregulated in the MonoD sample, resulting in an overall lack of change in expression in the PBMC sample. There were, however, also genes where the differential expression in response to LPS appeared markedly different between monocytes and PBMC, but were detectable in both samples. For example, the small inducible cytokine A5 (RANTES)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004427-Fessele1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> was highly differentially expressed in the Mono&#x0002b; sample.

This was done by calculating the reduction in fold change in gene expression that would occur in PBMC with different expression levels in non-monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004427-g008">figure 8</xref>). Increased expression in non-monocytes leads to greater dilution of the fold change in PBMC. This is illustrated by expression of the IL-1a gene. At 24 hours, IL-1a is expressed only in monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004427-g005">figure 5</xref>) and the fold change is therefore the same in monocytes and PBMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004427-g008">figures 8</xref>). In contrast, at 3 hours IL-1a is expressed in non-monocytes at about one sixth of the level in monocytes and this results in a reduction in fold change in PBMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004427-g008">figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004427-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004427.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>The fold change in gene expression after LPS-stimulation predicted in PBMC as a function of fold change in monocytes.</title><p>The top curve is for genes expressed only in monocytes with no attenuation of fold change.

Not surprisingly GO terms that were similarly over-represented in genes differentially expressed after LPS stimulation in both monocytes and PBMC were related to the immune response &#x02013; for example: response to biotic stimulus, defense response, inflammatory response and immune response, and these include genes such as TNF and MCP2. The GO terms statistically over-represented in the genes that were expressed most differently between monocytes and PBMC included more specific immune activities &#x02013; for example: regulation of T cell activation (eg LAT), chemotaxis (eg RANTES), lymphocyte differentiation (eg HDAC4) and B cell differentiation (eg HDAC5). In addition to the activity being more specified, the cell type was more specific, reinforcing the findings of different expression in different cell types.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we quantified the proportion of LPS-induced differentially expressed monocyte genes that could be measured in PBMC, and determined the extent to which gene expression in the non-monocyte cell fraction diluted or obscured fold changes that could be detected in the cell mixture. The effect of gene expression in the non-monocyte fraction diluting or obscuring the detection of expression of particular genes in PBMC was not insubstantial. More than half of the statistically significant LPS-induced changes in gene expression in monocytes were not detectable in the PBMC sample. However, the genes whose expression were most significantly changed in monocytes in response to LPS were those that could also be detected in PBMC as a whole. In our study, almost all genes (97&#x00025;) with a greater than four fold change were still detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004427-g004">figure 4b</xref>).</p><p>Future studies to quantify in more detail the diluting effect of differential expression in non-target cells on detectable gene expression of an individual cell type within a mixture, could be undertaken by means of titration experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004427-Holloway1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. A series of artificially mixed samples could be used, with, for example, decreasing proportions of MonoD added to Mono&#x0002b; samples.</p><p>We chose to study the interaction between monocytes and LPS because these inflammatory cells comprise a significant minority of PBMC (in this study 10&#x02013;14&#x00025;) and their interaction with LPS in initiating the inflammatory cascade in Gram negative bacterial infection is well described. It is likely that our results apply to the detection of gene expression in other situations. The proportion of genes in a particular cell type that can be detected in a cell mixture might be lower for target cells comprising a smaller proportion of the mixture or in which the cell type of interest is not the principal target or primary effector cell. However, it is probable that detection of the most differentially expressed genes would remain less susceptible to the influence of other cells within the cell mixture.</p><p>To ensure gene expression induced by LPS stimulation was comparable in the monocytes analysed alone and in those analysed within PBMC, monocytes were separated after stimulation of PBMC with LPS, thus preserving the interactions between cells. The repeatability of our results was confirmed by the high degree of correlation between the two PBMC samples analysed from the same individual. This control validated the relevance of the differences in gene expression detected between PBMC and the monocyte samples.</p><p>We included a number of other control samples to exclude the possibility that our results were confounded by artefactual or technical variability. Monocytes were isolated by different methods to enable us to control for the possibility that gene expression might be induced by binding of CD14 antibodies during positive selection of monocytes. The similarity in differential gene expression between the Mono&#x0002b; and Mono&#x02212; samples showed that changes in cell surface expression of CD14 or LPS-binding of CD14 did not have a major effect. The greater correlation between the PBMC and Mono&#x0002b; samples than between the PBMC and Mono&#x02212; samples reflects the higher proportion of monocytes selected using positive isolation. Negative isolation resulted in up to 50&#x00025; of non-monocytes cells remaining in the Mono&#x02212; sample. Possible explanations include the relatively lower efficacy of negative selection and the absence of antibodies to every non-monocyte cell type present in PBMC.</p><p>Artefactual or technical variability as a cause of differences in gene expression between samples was also excluded by the finding that the samples that shared the most similar technical processes (Mono&#x0002b; and MonoD) had the most different gene expression, whilst those that underwent the most different processes (Mono&#x0002b; and Mono&#x02212;) had the most similar expression.</p><p>Our study has important implications for the design and analysis of microarray-based studies. For studies in which detection of subtle changes in gene expression in a specific cell type is important, our study shows that analysing a cell mixture will miss a substantial proportion of changes. However, when only the most highly differentially expressed genes are of interest, it may not be necessary to undertake time-consuming and costly separation and analysis of individual cell types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was reviewed and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (23096A) at the Royal Children's Hospital, and informed consent was obtained verbally from the adult volunteers.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>PBMC separation and stimulation</title><p>Blood from two healthy volunteers was collected into tubes containing endotoxin-free lithium heparin (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
