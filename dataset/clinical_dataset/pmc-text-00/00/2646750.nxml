Because water diffuses slowly across lipid bilayers, liposomes with encapsulated chelated Gd have not been widely adopted as MR contrast agents. To overcome this limitation, we have synthesized chemically stabilized, porous polymersomes with encapsulated gadolinium (Gd) chelates. The polymerosmes, 125 nm in diameter, were produced from the aqueous assembly of diblock copolymers, PEO(1300)-<italic>b</italic>-PBD(2500) (PBdEO), and phospholipids, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC). The PBdEO was cross-linked using a chemical initiator and the POPC was extracted with surfactant, generating a highly porous outer membrane. The encapsulated Gd chelates were attached to dendrimers to prevent their leakage through the pores. It was estimated that, on average, nearly 44&#x02009;000 Gd were encapsulated within each polymersome. As a result of the slower rotational correlation time of Gd-labeled dendrimers and the porous outer membrane, the paramagnetic porous polymersomes exhibited an R1 relaxivity of 7.2 mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>1&#x02212;</sup> per Gd and 315&#x02009;637 mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per vesicle. This corresponds to a relaxivity that is amplified by a factor of &#x0223c;10<sup>5</sup> compared with Gd&#x02212;DTPA.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>la801027q</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>la-2008-01027q</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging procedures have become a common practice in diagnostic clinical medicine owing to their ability to provide high-resolution three-dimensional images of soft tissue. Many of these diagnostic procedures utilize intravenous MR contrast agents, such as gadolinium (Gd), to improve tissue contrast and to provide important information about perfusion, vascular permeability, and extracellular volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> The recent development of targeted paramagnetic contrast agents promises to even further expand the utility of diagnostic MR imaging by providing a mechanism to probe the molecular profile of tissues. In order to compensate for the low signal enhancement generated by individual Gd ions, most targeted Gd compounds have relied on the development of nanoplatforms that can carry a high payload of chelated Gd and which exhibit high longitudinal relaxivities (R1). In general, the R1 of Gd-based contrast agents is dependent on two key features, the water-exchange rate between bulk water and water bound to the chelated Gd and the rotational correlation time of the Gd ions.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>)The rotational correlation lifetime is generally increased through conjugation of Gd chelates to macromolecular objects. A wide range of macromolecules and other nanoparticulate systems have already been tested as platforms for Gd labeling. Some examples include dendrimers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> polymers,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>) liposomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> micelles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> emulsions,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>) and silica<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> nanoparticles. For these multimeric gadolinium complexes, it is not only the relaxivity per Gd that defines the effectiveness of the contrast agent but also the number of chelated Gd per nanoparticle. These two parameters can be represented as the relaxivity per nanoparticle.</p><p>Among the many nanoparticulate systems, those that are self-assembled from amphiphilic molecules (i.e., liposomes, micelles, and emulsions) are particularly attractive due to their unique structure wherein the hydrophobic domain serves as a natural carrier environment for hydrophobic drugs and the exterior surface provides a platform for attaching targeting ligands. Amphiphilic nanoparticles are easily transformed into paramagnetic contrast agents by either encapsulating chelated Gd within the hollow core (in the case of liposomes) or through the immobilization of chelated Gd onto the outer membrane surface. Although, liposomes with encapsulated Gd-chelates have previously been used for contrast-enhanced MR imaging, the slow flux of water across the membrane bilayer does impair the water exchange rate with encapsulated Gd and thus leads to a significant reduction in relaxivity.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) While this can be partially overcome by increasing the surface-to-volume ratio (i.e., decreasing the size of the vesicle), even liposomes 100 nm in diameter have been shown to exhibit a relaxivity (per Gd) that is 62% lower than free chelated Gd.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Reagents that are commonly used to increase the stability of liposomes, such as cholesterol. even further reduce the relaxivity of encapsulated Gd.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) Because of these concerns, vesicles with encapsulated Gd chelates have been all but abandoned as MR contrast agents and liposomes, micelles, and perfluorocarbon emulsions with Gd immobilized on the surface have become the preferred embodiment for MR imaging applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> In this study, we revive the possibility of using Gd-encapsulated vesicles with the development of a new porous polymersome nanoplatform, in which Gd relaxivity is not compromised following encapsulation but, in fact, improved. By taking advantage of the large intraparticle volume, we also show that much larger payloads of Gd per particle can be achieved compared with vesicles of similar size containing surface-immobilized Gd. Porous polymersomes are composed of three key features: (1) a stabilized polymer shell, (2) a porous membrane structure that allows for improved water flux across the bilayer, and (3) a dendrimer-attached Gd complex that is loaded inside the porous vesicles for MRI detection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Materials</title><p>PEO(1300)-<italic>b</italic>-PBD(2500) (PBdEO) was purchased from Polymer Source (Dorval, Quebec, Canada). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-<italic>N</italic>-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (Rhod-PE) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

Preparation of the porous polymersomes required generation-2 dendrimers to first be labeled with Gd&#x02212;DTPA.

To confirm that nonpolymerizable phospholipids were integrated into the polymer bilayer during vesicle formation, a low molar percentage of fluorescent phospholipid was used during fabrication. A classical swelling technique was also adopted to form giant vesicles that could be observed by microscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> As shown in Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, incorporation of the fluorescent lipid into the polymersome bilayer was evident at the resolution of the optical microscope.

The hydrodynamic diameter was measured by dynamic light scattering. Though vesicles were extruded through 100 nm pores, the resulting vesicles are larger than the corresponding pore diameter. This difference may result from the interplay between the mechanical constraints of the extrusion and the energetic constraints of the vesicles.

Treatment of unpolymerized vesicles with Triton X-100 led to complete vesicle dissolution (data not shown), as determined by dynamical light scattering (DLS). The vesicles dissolve and form mixed micelles when the surfactant concentration exceeds its critical concentration. When the chemically cross-linked polymersomes were treated with a high concentration of Triton X-100, the mean vesicle diameter was essentially unchanged compared with vesicles that had not been treated with Triton X-100 (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The second peak centered at 10 nm can be attributed to Triton X-100 micelles in the same solution. A similar peak at 10 nm was observed in samples containing just Triton X-100.

A visible loss of the rhodamine-labeled phospholipid was observed, while dynamic light scattering confirmed that the polymersomes retained their structure (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). To confirm that pores were, in fact, created, chemically stabilized porous polymersomes similar to those described above were synthesized with carboxyfluorescein encapsulated within the core. Following the extraction of the phospholipids with Triton X-100, the polymersomes were centrifuged on a Microcon centrifugal filtering device (Millipore) with a molecular weight cutoff of 100 kDa. The liquid that flowed through the filter was then tested for fluorescence. It was hypothesized that if pores were present in the polymersome, the encapsulated carboxyfluorescein would diffuse across the membrane bilayer and pass through the filter during centrifugation. Alternatively, if no pores were present, no fluorescence would be detected in the flow-through because the carboxyfluorescein would remain entrapped within the polymersomes, which are too large to pass through the filter. As seen in Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, when polymerized polymersomes were treated with Triton X-100, 4 times more carboxyfluorescein was detected in the flow-through compared with vesicles that had not been treated with Triton X-100. Samples that were not treated with Triton X-100 likely exhibit a weak fluorescent signal due to a small amount of free carboxyfluorescein that was not removed during polymersome purification. When analogous studies were performed on polymersomes that had not been doped with phospholipids (i.e., no pores), only 1.2 times more carboxyfluorescein fluorescences was detected in the flow-through following treatment with Triton X-100 (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). This small increase is due to the effect of Triton X-100 on carboxyfluorescein fluorescence.

T1 relaxation times were determined using a Bruker mq60 MR relaxometer operating at 1.41 T (60 MHz) and at 40 &#x000b0;C. It was found that the R1 relaxivity per Gd was 7.2 mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Polymersomes with encapsulated Gd-labeled dendrimer but no pores exhibited an R1 relaxivity of 3.1 mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per Gd. Assuming no polymer was lost during the synthesis process and an average polymersome diameter of 125 nm, it was estimated that there were approximately 43&#x02009;838 Gd per porous polymersome. The relaxivity per porous polymersome was then calculated, giving an R1 equal to 315&#x02009;637 mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. For comparison, chelated Gd alone was determined to possess an R1 relaxivity of 3.9 mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Therefore, the polymersomes generate a relaxivity that is amplified by a factor of &#x0223c;10<sup>5</sup> for T1-weighted imaging.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Relaxivity determination for Gd&#x02212;dendrimer conjugates encapsulated within cross-linked porous polymersomes.

For example, Gd-labeled shell-cross-linked nanoparticles (40 nm diameter) exhibit an R1 of 39 mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per Gd (0.47 T) but possess only 510 Gd per particle, which results in an R1 of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per nanoparticle.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) This relaxivity is significantly lower than the paramagnetic porous polymersomes presented here.</p><p>Paramagnetic silica nanoparticles (&#x0223c;100 nm) have been found to exhibit an R1 of 9.0 mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per Gd (4.7 T) and contain 16&#x02009;000 Gd per nanoparticle, which results in an R1 of 1.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per nanoparticle.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>) While these properties are similar to those of the paramagnetic polymersomes, polymersomes possess a hydrophobic domain that presents a natural carrier environment for hydrophobic drugs. This may allow paramagnetic porous polymersomes to be more readily adapted for combined targeted drug delivery and MR imaging.</p><p>Perfluorocarbon nanoparticles have a reported R1 of 25.3 mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per Gd (1.5 T) and 94&#x02009;200 Gd per particle, which results in an R1 of 2.38 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per nanoparticle. Although this relaxivity is higher than that of the 125 nm polymersomes reported here, it should be noted that the perfluorocarbon particles are much larger with a diameter of 273 nm.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>) Scaling with volume, a porous polymersome of this size would possess 456&#x02009;681 Gd and exhibit an R1 of 3.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> per polymersome. Also, while perfluorocarbons only exhibit a half-life of &#x0223c;1 h, polymersomes &#x0223c;100 nm in diameter have a reported plasma half-life of &#x0003e;15 h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> The smaller size and extended half-life of polymersomes could provide important advantages in molecular imaging applications, including improved tissue penetration and increased target site accumulation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the preparation of chemically stabilized porous polymersomes for magnetic resonance imaging applications has been described. The porous vesicle membrane leads to a significant improvement in the water-exchange rate of the encapsulated Gd due to the faster flux of water across the bilayer. The relaxivity of the nanoparticle is also improved due to the slower rotational correlation lifetime of the encapsulated Gd&#x02212;dendrimers. In addition, the polymersomes possess an unobstructed outer surface that may be used for attaching targeting ligands and a hydrophobic domain that presents a natural carrier environment for hydrophobic drugs. Therefore, the porous polymersomes described here provide a powerful new platform for combined targeted drug delivery and MR imaging.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported in part by the National Institute of Health (NCI) (R21 CA-125088), the American Cancer Society (RSG-07-005-01), and the Transdisciplinary Program in Translational Medicine and Therapeutics.
