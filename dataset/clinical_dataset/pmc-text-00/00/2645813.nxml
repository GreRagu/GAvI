The p53 gene is frequently deleted or mutated in human cancers, resulting in loss of p53 activity. This leads to centrosome amplification, aneuploidy, and tumorigenesis, three phenotypes also observed after overexpression of the oncogenic kinase Aurora A. Accordingly, recent studies have focused on the relationship between these two proteins. p53 and Aurora A have been reported to interact in mammalian cells, but the function of this interaction remains unclear. We recently reported that <italic>Xenopus</italic> p53 can inhibit Aurora A activity <italic>in vitro</italic> but only in the absence of TPX2. Here we investigate the interplay between <italic>Xenopus</italic> Aurora A, TPX2, and p53 and show that newly synthesized TPX2 is required for nearly all Aurora A activation and for full p53 synthesis and phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic> during oocyte maturation. <italic>In vitro</italic>, phosphorylation mediated by Aurora A targets serines 129 and 190 within the DNA binding domain of p53. Glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase pull-down studies indicate that the interaction occurs via the p53 transactivation domain and the Aurora A catalytic domain around the T-loop. Our studies suggest that targeting of TPX2 might be an effective strategy for specifically inhibiting the phosphorylation of Aurora A substrates, including p53.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by the <grant-sponsor>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</grant-sponsor> and by grants from the <grant-sponsor>CNRS</grant-sponsor> and the <grant-sponsor>Union Internationale Contre le Cancer</grant-sponsor> (to C.

Overexpression of either human or <italic>Xenopus</italic> Aurora A transforms mammalian cells, but only when the p53 pathway is altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). Aurora A is localized on centrosomes during mitosis, and overexpression of the protein leads to centrosome amplification and aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), two likely contributors to genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Because of its oncogenic potential and amplification in human tumors, considerable attention has been focused on the mechanism of Aurora A activation in mitosis. Evidence from several laboratories indicates that activation occurs as a result of phosphorylation of a threonine residue in the T-loop of the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Purification of Aurora A-activating activity from M phase <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts led to an apparent activation mechanism in which autophosphorylation at the T-loop is stimulated by binding of the targeting protein for Xklp2 (TPX2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). On the other hand, it has been shown that Aurora A activity can be inhibited by interaction with several proteins, including PP1 (protein phosphatase 1), AIP (Aurora A kinase-interacting protein), and, more recently, p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>).</p><p>p53 is a well known tumor suppressor able to drive cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or senescence when DNA is damaged or cell integrity is threatened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). In human cancers, the p53 gene is frequently deleted or mutated, leading to inactivation of p53 functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). p53 protein is almost undetectable in &#x0201c;normal cells,&#x0201d; mainly due to its instability. Indeed, during a normal cell cycle, p53 associates with Mdm2 in the nucleus and thereafter undergoes nuclear exclusion, allowing its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). In cells under stress, p53 is stabilized through the disruption of its interaction with Mdm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>), leading to p53 accumulation in the nucleus and triggering different responses, as described above.</p><p>Although p53 has mostly been characterized as a nuclear protein, it has also been shown to localize on centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>) and regulate centrosome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Centrosomes are believed to act as scaffolds that concentrate many regulatory molecules involved in signal transduction, including multiple protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Thus, centrosomal localization of p53 might be important for its own regulation by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and one of its regulators could be the mitotic kinase Aurora A. Indeed, phenotypes associated with the misexpression of these two proteins are very similar. For example, overexpression of Aurora A kinase leads to centrosome amplification, aneuploidy, and tumorigenesis, and the same effects are often observed after down-regulation of p53 transactivation activity or deletion/mutation of its gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>).</p><p>Several recent studies performed in mammalian models show interplay between p53 and Aurora A, with each protein having the ability to inhibit the other, depending on the stage of the cell cycle and the stress level of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). These studies reported that p53 is a substrate of Aurora A, and serines 215 and 315 were demonstrated to be the two major Aurora A phosphorylation sites in human p53 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Phosphorylation of Ser-215 within the DNA binding domain of human p53 inhibited both p53 DNA binding and transactivation activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). Recently, our group showed that <italic>Xenopus</italic> p53 is able to inhibit Aurora A kinase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, but this inhibitory effect can be suppressed by prior binding of Aurora A to TPX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Contrary to somatic cells, where p53 is nuclear, unstable, and expressed at a very low level, p53 is highly expressed in the cytoplasm of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and stable until later stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). The high concentration of both p53 and Aurora A in the oocyte provided a suitable basis for investigating p53-Aurora A interaction and also evaluating <italic>Xenopus</italic> p53 as a substrate of Aurora A.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Antibodies</italic>&#x02014;Anti-p53 mouse monoclonal (X77) antibody was from Novus (catalog number NB 200-566), anti-FLAG-M2/horseradish peroxidase and anti-actin (AC40) antibodies were from Sigma (catalog numbers A8592 and A3853), anti-Myc (9E10)/horseradish peroxidase antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

However, the behavior of p53 during oocyte maturation has not been investigated. Toward that aim, the abundance and electrophoretic mobility of endogenous <italic>Xenopus</italic> p53 was monitored in Pro I (G<sub>2</sub>-arrested) oocytes, in oocytes undergoing GVBD after progesterone stimulation, and in oocytes arrested at metaphase II of meiosis (Meta II). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>, the level of endogenous p53 increases markedly during oocyte maturation, and a substantial fraction undergoes an electrophoretic upshift between Pro I and GVBD that is maintained and even reinforced in MII oocytes. The same experiment conducted on oocytes injected with mRNA encoding FLAG-tagged full-length p53 shows that the upshift also occurs with the FLAG-p53 protein and can be observed either with anti-p53 antibody or with anti-FLAG antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). To investigate whether this upshift is due to phosphorylation, we treated a metaphase II extract with &#x003bb;-phosphatase and analyzed p53 electrophoretic mobility by Western blot. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref> shows that &#x003bb;-phosphatase converts all p53 to the faster migrating form, indicating that the mobility shift is due to phosphorylation of p53.</p><p>Since this phosphorylation occurs at GVBD, when many kinases, including Aurora A, are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>), we considered whether Aurora A was involved in phosphorylation of p53. One approach to investigate this possibility is to inhibit Aurora A kinase activity during maturation. Accordingly, we used a commercially available Aurora A kinase inhibitor (catalog number C1368; Sigma). We first confirmed the ability of this inhibitor to suppress the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase activity of purified <italic>Xenopus</italic> Aurora A (data not shown) and then tested its effect <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this aim, we microinjected the inhibitor into Stage VI (Pro I-arrested) oocytes at a final concentration of 50 &#x003bc;g/ml (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref><italic>, right</italic>), whereas control oocytes were injected with the control vehicle (<italic>left</italic>). Oocyte extracts were then prepared at Pro I and Meta II stages. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref> (<italic>top</italic>) shows that the activation of Aurora A was completely blocked, as judged by the disappearance of the electrophoretic upshift characteristic of Aurora A kinase activation <italic>in vitro</italic> and during oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). In the same oocytes, the upshift of p53, indicative of phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>), was blocked. It was also observed that less total p53 was present at Meta II in oocytes in which Aurora A was inhibited. Other major biochemical events of maturation, including activation of MAPK (phospho-MAPK) and Plx1 (phospho-Thr-201 Plx1), as judged by T-loop phosphorylation, and activation of cyclin B/Cdc2 (phospho-Tyr-15 Cdc2), as judged by removal of inhibitory phosphorylation at Tyr-15, were not affected by Aurora A inhibition. These results suggested that activated Aurora A was required for p53 phosphorylation during oocyte maturation.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Activation of Aurora A by TPX2 is required for full accumulation and phosphorylation of p53.</bold> Immature oocytes were injected with control morpholinos (<italic>left</italic>) or morpholinos against TPX2 (<italic>right</italic>) and then stimulated to mature by the addition of progesterone.

Thus, it was important to inhibit Aurora A kinase activity more specifically. Previous work has demonstrated that TPX2 is an activator of Aurora A present in Meta II oocytes that does not activate Aurora B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Therefore, we specifically impaired Aurora A activity by ablation of TPX2 with antisense oligonucleotides. First, we examined the level of TPX2 before and after maturation. TPX2 is present at a low level in Pro I-arrested oocytes and accumulates to a much higher level during maturation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, control morpholinos). Microinjection of oocytes with a morpholino specifically targeting TPX2 mRNA prior to progesterone stimulation inhibited accumulation of TPX2 protein at GVBD but did not eliminate the low level of protein already present at Pro I (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>TPX2</italic>). Importantly, inhibition of TPX2 accumulation blocked the Aurora A upshift in Meta II oocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>Aurora A</italic>). Furthermore, use of a phosphoantibody targeting the phosphorylated T-loop of Aurora A showed almost complete elimination of T-loop phosphorylation after ablation of TPX2 synthesis with morpholinos, suggesting that Aurora A kinase activity is strongly inhibited in these oocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>pT295 Aur A</italic>). Interestingly, this reduction in Aurora A activity was correlated with a partial downshift of p53 in the same extract, indicating that at least part of the p53 phosphorylation during maturation is due to Aurora A activity. To confirm that this effect on p53 phosphorylation is due to inhibition of Aurora A activity and not to secondary effects on other major kinases, we monitored the behavior of Polo-like kinase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>Plx1</italic> and <italic>pT201 Plx1</italic>), MAPK (<italic>pMAPK</italic>) and Cdc2 kinase (<italic>pY15 Cdc2</italic>). None of these kinases were affected by the TPX2 morpholino (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The reduced phosphorylation of p53 after TPX2 knockdown confirms that the effects on p53 seen with the Aurora A inhibitor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>) were indeed due to failure to activate Aurora A.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>p53 and Aurora A interact <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes.</bold> mRNA encoding 6&#x000d7; Myc-Aurora A was injected into resting Stage VI <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes.

This could be explained by a decreased stability or synthesis of p53 in the absence of active Aurora A. However, p53 stability was not affected by Aurora A inhibition using either the Aurora A inhibitor or TPX2 morpholinos (Fig. S1). Therefore, the reduced p53 level observed in Figs. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1<italic>D</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> may be due to a decrease in p53 synthesis. Altogether, these results provide strong evidence that p53 is synthesized and phosphorylated during oocyte maturation in a manner dependent, at least partially, on Aurora A activity.</p><p><italic>Aurora A and p53 Interact in Vivo and in Vitro in Xenopus Oocytes</italic>&#x02014;The dependence of p53 phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic> on Aurora A activation suggests both Aurora A and p53 might interact in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes during maturation. To evaluate this hypothesis, we injected mRNA encoding Myc<sub>6</sub>-tagged wild-type Aurora A (Myc-Aurora A) into resting Stage VI oocytes. Then meiotic maturation was induced with progesterone, and extracts were prepared when the oocytes reached metaphase II (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). When Myc-Aurora A was immunoprecipitated from oocytes, endogenous p53 was co-immunoprecipitated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>lane 5</italic>). This was not the case when the immunoprecipitation was performed with a control anti-mouse IgG (<italic>lane 4</italic>) or in the absence of Myc-Aurora A (<italic>lane 3</italic>). These results indicate that Aurora A and p53 interact in <italic>Xenopus</italic> Meta II-arrested oocytes.

To determine more precisely which part of the catalytic domain mediates this interaction, we subjected even smaller pieces to pulldown analysis. Our results show that the site of interaction is a 35-amino acid domain (amino acids 270&#x02013;305) in the &#x003b1;-helical region surrounding Thr-295 in the T-loop of Aurora A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p>We also carried out reciprocal experiments to define which domain in p53 interacts with Aurora A.

These results indicate that serine 129 and serine 190 are the primary sites of p53 phosphorylation by Aurora A <italic>in vitro</italic>, and both sites are in the DNA binding domain.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results in this paper provide new evidence for p53-Aurora A interaction <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is notable that the areas of interaction are important ones for both proteins: the kinase catalytic domain of Aurora A and the transactivation domain of p53. The fact that the phosphorylation sites for Aurora A on p53 are in the adjacent DNA binding domain of p53 suggests a model in which binding of Aurora A to the transactivation domain facilitates the phosphorylation of nearby residues in the DNA binding domain. It has been established from multiple studies that the ability of Aurora A to transform mammalian cells and to cause centrosome amplification is evident only in cells lacking a functional p53 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). Since p53 inhibits Aurora A activity, it is tempting to speculate that the absence of p53 enhances the transforming activity of Aurora A by removing an inhibitor of its activation.</p><p>The data presented here show a strong correlation between Aurora A activity stimulated by TPX2 and up-regulation of p53 levels and phosphorylation. Previous protein purification work from this laboratory had identified TPX2 as an activator of Aurora A present in Meta II (cytostatic factor-arrested) <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), and the binding site for TPX2 on Aurora A has been well characterized both at the structural level and by mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). Our data here show that the level of TPX2 markedly increases during maturation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), and TPX2 undergoes an electrophoretic shift in Meta II oocytes, most likely due to phosphorylation by associated Aurora A, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). The knockdown of TPX2 accumulation by morpholinos resulted in loss of virtually all Aurora A activation as judged both by the electrophoretic mobility of Aurora A and phosphorylation of the T-loop, which is required for Aurora A activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). Although other activators of Aurora A have been reported in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>), our data suggest that no other quantitatively important activator of Aurora A is present in Meta II <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs. The dramatic effects of TPX2 knockdown on p53 accumulation and phosphorylation suggest that it is a specific consequence of a failure by TPX2 to activate Aurora A. This was further confirmed using a chemical inhibitor of Aurora A that did not affect TPX2 accumulation (not shown) but did block increased p53 level and phosphorylation (Figs. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1<italic>D</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). On the other hand, the ectopic expression of Aurora A in oocytes resulted in an increased p53 level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). It is interesting that Aurora A affects not only the phosphorylation of p53 but also its accumulation during maturation. This increase seen upon ectopic expression of Aurora A is probably accounted for by increased synthesis of p53, because the half-life of microinjected radiolabeled p53 was unaffected by Aurora A inhibition (Fig. S1). The mechanism of increased synthesis is unclear, but other proteins (<italic>e.g.</italic> c-Mos and cyclin B1) that have been reported to be newly synthesized during maturation are translated only after complex phosphorylation and processing events occurring at the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref>). These events involve Maskin and the cytoplasmic element-binding protein, two known substrates of Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref>), and require the presence of a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region of the target mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref>). Since examination of the p53 gene revealed the presence of a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element motif in its 3&#x02032;-untranslated region, it seems likely that p53 translation may be regulated by Aurora A during maturation. Further work is necessary to evaluate whether the p53 cytoplasmic polyadenylation element is functional and the precise mechanism of its regulation. Preventing Aurora A activation with TPX2 morpholinos did not have any obvious effect on Meta II arrest or the activation of several other M phase kinases, including Plx1, MAPK, and Cdc2. The possibility cannot be excluded, however, that meiotic spindle assembly was affected by decreased Aurora A activity. Indeed, impairment of Aurora A function by injection of anti-Aurora A antibodies was previously reported to affect spindle rotation and polar body exclusion but not cytoplasmic cell cycle events, like cyclin B2 degradation following GVBD or parthenogenetic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of p53 interaction with Aurora A indicates that p53 binds in a region near the T-loop containing Thr-295. Previous work has suggested that Thr-295 is readily accessible to PP1 in interphase. Upon binding to TPX2 at nuclear envelope breakdown, biochemical and structural studies indicate that the T-loop is shielded from dephosphorylation by PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). TPX2 binding thus permits net autophosphorylation at Thr-295 and autoactivation of Aurora A, and TPX2 also targets the complex to polar microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). As reported previously, p53 can inhibit the activity of full-length Aurora A or its catalytic domain <italic>in vitro</italic>, but inhibition is lost if the complex is activated by TPX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Since p53 binds near the T-loop, the shielding of this area by TPX2 may account for the resistance of the TPX2-Aurora A complex to inhibition by p53.</p><p>At this point, the consequences of TPX2-Aurora A-dependent phosphorylation of p53 are unclear. In oocytes, all p53 appears to be cytoplasmic and therefore unlikely to be involved in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). During the postfertilization cleavage divisions, a small fraction of p53 translocates into the nucleus at each division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>), but since transcription is largely absent from embryos until the midblastula transition (12th cleavage), it is unlikely that p53 is involved in transcription-dependent processes. Instead, in early embryos, it has been suggested to play a role in S phase regulation and in DNA repair, to prevent reinitiation of DNA replication during S phase, and to block premature entry from S phase into mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>). During mitosis or M phase, many transcription factors are inactivated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>). Since the Aurora A phosphorylation sites are in the DNA binding domain, one could anticipate that p53-dependent transcription would be inhibited during M phase. Indeed, it is interesting to note that Aurora A-mediated phosphorylation of human p53 on Ser-215, the equivalent of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Ser-190, leads to abrogation of both DNA binding and transactivation activity of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). Thus, a potential function for these phosphorylations during oocyte maturation could be to silence p53 transactivation activity. The conservation of this site and its phosphorylation by Aurora A suggest that it plays an important regulatory role. A major function of p53 in somatic cells is to participate in the DNA damage response, inducing transcription of either cell cycle arrest genes or those promoting apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). However, in oocytes or embryos before midblastula transition, the DNA damage response is not evident in response to X-irradiation or DNA double-stranded breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>). Therefore, at this stage of development, Aurora A-dependent phosphorylation of p53 is unlikely to regulate the DNA damage response.</p><p>Another potential function of Aurora A-p53 interaction is on the centrosome. Both Aurora A and a small fraction of p53 are localized on the centrosome in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>). Studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> XL2 cells have also shown that they are co-localized on the centrosome.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">4</xref> There is considerable indirect evidence that p53 and Aurora A are important for centrosome duplication. Overexpression of either human or <italic>Xenopus</italic> Aurora A can transform mammalian cells, but only if p53 function is deficient. In tumors in which Aurora A is overexpressed, centrosome amplification is common and is thought to contribute to chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>). On the other hand, studies of mouse embryo fibroblasts from mice lacking p53 show that even after early passages, centrosome amplification occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). These results suggest that p53 exerts a negative impact on centrosome duplication, although details are lacking. More work is needed to evaluate whether a negative role might be exerted via inhibition of Aurora A. In early embryos, centrosomes duplicate once and only once in each cell cycle and are initially involved in organizing a bipolar spindle at each mitosis. However, in oocytes, where Aurora A-p53 interaction was defined in this paper, spindles form in the absence of centrosomes by fusion of two half-spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>). Therefore, the Aurora A-p53 interactions that form during oocyte maturation may be established to support the rapid cell divisions that occur after Meta II oocytes are fertilized and spindle poles become organized by centrosomes. This concept is consistent with evidence that enzymes and proteins needed for DNA synthesis and centrosome duplication after fertilization appear in Meta II, although no DNA synthesis occurs during oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>).</p><p>By using antisense morpholinos, we were able to show that new synthesis of TPX2 is required for full synthesis and phosphorylation of p53 during oocyte maturation. Thus, this study provides the first evidence that TPX2 plays an important role in the regulation of p53 via Aurora A. The fact that Aurora A-mediated p53 phosphorylation is blocked efficiently by TPX2 inhibition, whereas other mitotic regulators (<italic>e.g.</italic> Polo-like kinase 1, MAPK, and Cdc2) are not affected is important for the following reasons. First, both Aurora A and TPX2 (initially identified as REPP86 (restrictedly expressed proliferation-associated protein of 86 kDa) are overexpressed in some tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of TPX2 significantly reduces the survival of multiple human cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref>). Second, pharmacological inhibitors targeting the oncogenic kinase Aurora A also target Aurora B in most cases. Therefore, specifically targeting Aurora A by inhibiting TPX2 might be a promising strategy for cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M805959200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M805959200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Fu, J., Bian, M., Jiang, Q., and Zhang, C.
