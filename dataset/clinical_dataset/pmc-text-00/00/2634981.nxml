The placenta is an attractive target for studies in which the role of specific proteins can be compared with cell culture models and explanted villous tissue where physiological function can be maintained ex vivo.</p><p>In this study, we compared a variety of commercially available reagents and approaches to define methods for efficient delivery of siRNA to placental cells. Protocols optimised using fluorescently-labelled siRNA were subsequently tested using siRNA sequences that target placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), chosen because of its high abundance in trophoblast. mRNA abundance was assayed using qRT-PCR, and the effect on protein was examined using immunolocalisation.</p><p>We report that different protocols are required for BeWo choriocarcinoma cells (nucleofection), primary cytotrophoblast cells (lipid-based transfection) and villous tissue explants (nucleofection). The results provide guidelines for optimal siRNA-mediated knockdown in these three models of the human placenta.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>BeWo</kwd><kwd>Syncytiotrophoblast cells</kwd><kwd>First trimester placenta</kwd><kwd>Transfection</kwd><kwd>Placental alkaline phosphatase</kwd><kwd>siRNA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Deletion and mutation have been widely used to examine single gene function in mouse, where more than 100 genes that are required for placental development have been identified <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, to date, only a small fraction of these has been shown to be important for human placental development or function. It is of interest to develop methods capable of effectively blocking specific gene products in the human placenta, both for basic investigations of gene function and future therapeutic approaches to pregnancy pathologies such as abnormal fetal growth. The use of inhibitors can be problematic as availability is limited and many are non-specific and have multiple cellular targets.

We have optimised delivery of siRNA sequences into placental cell lines, isolated cells and tissue, and demonstrated efficient knockdown at both mRNA and protein level of the highly abundant protein, placental alkaline phosphatase.</p><p>Most published studies reporting siRNA or antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown in the human placenta have focussed on cell lines. Though cell lines offer advantages including convenience and ease of transfection, reported transfection efficiencies vary, and for studies of normal placental function it is preferable to study primary trophoblast cells and tissue explants. We are unaware of previous reports of siRNA delivery into primary cytotrophoblast cells and there are limited available data in placental tissue.</p><p>Calcium phosphate-assisted transfection is a relatively easy and inexpensive method for introducing RNA or DNA but is reported to show very low efficiency in placental cells <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Limited delivery was achieved with either poly-L-ornithine or DEAE-dextran (25% and 6.25% respectively <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>). More recently siRNA or plasmid DNA has been introduced into placental cell lines such as JAR, JEG or BeWo using Lipofectamine, however many of these studies do not report transfection efficiency <xref rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[12,13]</xref>, whilst others report efficiencies varying in the range 50&#x02013;80% using Lipofectamine <xref rid="bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr">[14,15]</xref>. In our hands Lipofectamine can be used to introduce siRNA into BeWo cells however, the transfection efficiency is low and subsequent analysis revealed little effect on protein level (data not shown).</p><p>Numerous reagents have been used to deliver siRNA into primary cells, which are generally considered to be hard to transfect. Zhang et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> have reported successful use of Lipofectamine 2000 in human placental fibroblasts. However, their procedure involves a trypsinisation step prior to siRNA delivery which is unsuitable for primary human cytotrophoblast cells, as once isolated and cultured, these cells are non-proliferative and do not survive further rounds of trypsinisation. We have found that DharmaFECT2 transfection reagent applied to 18&#x000a0;h primary human cytotrophoblast cells in culture is an effective method for introducing siRNA into primary human cytotrophoblast.</p><p>In the absence of delivery agents, siRNA spontaneously enters the syncytium of first trimester villous tissue, but cannot access underlying cytotrophoblast cells or the villous stroma. This does enable knockdown of syncytial proteins, as recently demonstrated by the reduction of p53 and mdm2 in term placenta <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In addition to syncytium, PLAP is expressed in cytotrophoblast cells and to some extent in stromal cells; here we found only a small reduction in protein expression without active delivery of siRNA. The nucleofector-based method we describe delivers siRNA to placental explants to produce knockdown in cell populations beneath the syncytium.</p><p>In this study we have used PLAP to demonstrate that an abundant placental protein can be depleted using each of the optimal delivery methods described. Other gene products may behave differently depending on siRNA design and half-life of target mRNA, hence specific optimisation is recommended before undertaking functional experiments, including target sequences, siRNA concentrations and exposure times <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, this study highlights the importance of validating delivery methodologies to obtain optimal conditions when using siRNA. We have demonstrated that effective delivery to primary cytotrophoblast cells is by transfection with DharmaFECT, whilst the optimal conditions for introducing siRNA into BeWo cells and placental explant tissue (beyond the syncytiotrophoblast) is by electroporation using a nucleofector. As new technologies emerge, improved siRNA delivery may be expected. At present however, the techniques described are suitable for studying the role of individual genes and their translation products <italic>in vitro</italic> and will aid in the analysis of placental development and function. Future possibilities include the introduction of RNAi into the placenta as a therapeutic strategy for pregnancy complications and diseases with fetal onset.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group

BBSRC and the Wellcome Trust. We would also like to thank the midwives and nurses at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester for their help in obtaining tissue. KF, JDA and MW conceived the idea for the study and along with MD, designed the experiments. The experimental work was performed by KF (BeWo and explant transfection; PLAP protein analysis), MD (cytotrophoblast transfection; PLAP mRNA analysis), RG (BeWo/explant mRNA analysis) and MW (BeWo/explant mRNA analysis). KF, MD and MW, analysed the data. KF and MD prepared the first draft of the paper which was critically revised by all other authors.</p></ack></back><floats-group><fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Delivery of siRNA to BeWo cells. 24&#x000a0;h after transfection cells were fixed and stained with DAPI (blue) <bold>(A)</bold>; optimal delivery of fluorescently-labelled siRNA (red) was achieved using an Amaxa Nucleofector with cell line solution L and program X005 <bold>(B)</bold>. <bold>(C)</bold> Cells exposed to transfection conditions in the absence of siRNA (mock) or cells transfected with non-targeting (100&#x000a0;nM) or PLAP-specific siRNA (100&#x000a0;nM) were cultured for 72&#x000a0;h and then analysed for PLAP mRNA expression (median and range, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7).
