Important factors determining CNS targeting include tropism of the viral vectors and retrograde transport of the vector particles. Retrograde transport of equine anemia virus (EIAV)-based lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the glycoprotein derived from the Rabies virus RabERA strain from peripheral muscle to spinal motor neurons (MNs) was previously reported. Despite therapeutic effects achieved in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the efficiency of this approach needs to be improved for clinical translation. To date there has not been a quantitative assessment of pseudotyped HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors to transduce MNs. Here, we describe quantitative tests to analyze the retrograde transport capacity of HIV-1 vectors pseudotyped with the G glycoprotein derived from Rabies and Rabies-related viruses (Lyssaviruses).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>With a view toward optimizing the retrograde transport properties of HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors, we compared the glycoproteins from different enveloped viruses belonging to the <italic>Rhabdoviridae </italic>family, genus <italic>Lyssavirus</italic>, and evaluated their ability to transduce specific cell populations and promote retrograde axonal transport. We first tested the transduction performance of these pseudotypes <italic>in vitro </italic>in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, NSC-34 neuroblastoma-spinal cord hybrid cells, and primary mixed spinal cord and pure astrocyte cultures.

The larger cloning capacity of lentiviral vectors, however, makes them more suitable for therapeutic purposes. A variety of primate lentiviral vectors including vectors based on HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], or on non-primate lentiviral vectors such as EIAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] have been shown to mediate significant transgene delivery in the mammalian nervous system. Finally, lentiviral-based gene transfer strategies have been widely tested for the treatment of neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), spinal cord injury, metabolic disorders, and MND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We have recently reviewed the existing gene therapy strategies for MND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although direct vector injection has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], gene delivery to spinal cord MNs by retrograde axonal transport following muscle injection is the main strategy being currently explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>It has been well documented that the tropism of lentiviral vectors can be altered using pseudotyping strategies, which consist in the replacement of the vector envelope glycoprotein for alternative glycoproteins derived from other enveloped viruses. A wide range of viral envelope glycoproteins, including those from Rabies and Mokola viruses have been used for pseudotyping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, considerable differences in the brain transduction patterns were demonstrated even between related Lyssavirus-derived glycoproteins. For example, transduction of the mouse striatum by HIV-1 vectors pseudotyped with the glycoprotein derived from a Zimbabwean Mokola virus was inefficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], while HIV-1 vectors bearing an Ethiopian Mokola virus glycoprotein revealed robust transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>To date there has not been a quantitative assessment of pseudotyped HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors to transduce MNs. In the present study, we compared four different titer-adjusted HIV-1 vector pseudotypes bearing envelope glycoproteins from Rabies-related viruses, such as the European Bat Lyssavirus (EBL1), the Lagos Bat Lyssavirus (LagNGA), the Duvenhage (DuvSAF1) Lyssavirus, and Rabies PV virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] in terms of their transduction efficiencies <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the Rabies PV G-glycoprotein had the best performance in all the assays conducted, being, therefore, a promising candidate for future gene delivery strategies involving pseudotyped HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>293T cells (CRL-11268), human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells (CRL-1543) and BHK21 cells (CCL-10) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC CRL-2266) were grown to 70% confluence and maintained in a growth medium containing a 1:1 mixture of EMEM and Ham's F12 medium (90%) (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone). Medium was renewed every 2 days. The NSC-34 neuroblastoma-spinal cord hybrid cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] was provided by Dr. Neil Cashman, Toronto.

Dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and perineural membranes were removed and cords cut into approximately 2-mm sections, which were then triturated and dissociated in a 0.05% trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA solution. Cells were collected, centrifuged for 5 min at 1800 rpm, and resuspended in complete growth medium made in supplemented Neurobasal Medium (Invitrogen-GIBCO).

Briefly, DRG explants were plated into the inner compartments of Campenot compartmentalized chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] in a small volume of medium and allowed to adhere for two hours. The chambers were prepared as follows: 35-mm cell culture dishes were pre-coated with a diluted collagen solution (three parts of sterile distilled H<sub>2</sub>O to one part of rat tail collagen type I &#x02013; 2 mg/ml &#x02013; Roche Diagnostics Corp.). Scratches were then made in the collagen substratum using a pin rake, to guide axon growth. A drop of medium was placed onto the plate before setting the divider onto the culture dish, in order to facilitate axon growth underneath the silicon grease barriers. Teflon chamber dividers (Tyler Research) were then carefully attached to the collagen-coated dishes using silicone vacuum grease (Dow Corning). After 1 h in the incubator, the inner compartments of the chambers were filled with culture medium to check for leakage. Chambers that showed any leakage were discarded and those that appeared well-sealed were filled with culture medium. Fluorescence was also used to demonstrate the absence of leakage between chambers, by adding a fluorescent tracer (DiI &#x02013; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Corporation) in the inner compartment. The compartments were then filled with growth medium, consisting of Neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 additive (Invitrogen), 50 ng/ml of Nerve Growth Factor 2.5S (NGF) (Invitrogen), and 40 &#x003bc;M of 5'-Fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine &#x02013; FUDR (Sigma-Aldrich). The outer compartments were filled with growth medium supplemented with 100&#x02013;200 ng/ml of NGF to coax neurite growth into these compartments. Cells were re-fed every other day. The outer compartments were also re-filled every other day with growth medium supplemented with NGF.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b2;-Gal staining and immunocytochemistry (ICC)</title><p>SH-SY5Y cells and mixed spinal cord cell cultures were processed for &#x003b2;-Gal staining 3 days after transduction using an X-Gal staining kit (Invitrogen). In order to identify neurons and glia in the cultures transduced with the EGFP-encoding vectors, ICC was performed with antibody directed against microtubule associated protein 2 (Map-2) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The Map-2 antibody (Covance Research Products) was used at a concentration of 1:10,000 and anti-GFAP antibody (Promega) at a concentration of 1:1000.

The primers used for reverse transcription were: Rabies PV: 5' CGG GAT CCG GCC AGC TCT CAC AGT CCG GT; DuvSAF: 5' CGG GAT CCC TCT CAC TCC CTT GTT GAT GG; EBL1: 5' CGG GAT CCT GCT TAT GAC TCA CAA GTA GT; LagNGA: 5' GGA ATT CTT GTT ACC ATG AGT CAA CTA AAA. The glycoprotein coding regions were subsequently PCR amplified using AccuPrime&#x02122; Pfx DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and subcloned into pLTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] to yield pLTR-PV, pLTR-DuvSAF, pLTR-EBL1 and pLTR-LagNGA, respectively.

Sciatic nerve injections were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Briefly, adult male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan), weighing 275&#x02013;300 g, were anesthetized with nose-cone isoflurane (2% in O<sub>2</sub>). The lateral surface of the right thigh was shaved, sterilized, and a skin incision was made parallel to the femur. Using a dissecting microscope (StereoZoom 6; Leica), the sciatic nerve was exposed and a 5-0 silk suture was tied to provide gentle counter traction during the nerve injection. To crush the nerve, a clamp was placed around the nerve immediately before the tie, closed to the first lock and then released. Using an automatic microinjector (Nanoject II; Drummond), nerves were injected with 2 &#x003bc;l of the different &#x003b2;-Gal-encoding pseudotypes (n = 5/group), adjusted at 1.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>TU per &#x003bc;l. After injection, the femoral musculature was reapproximated and the skin stapled. Animals were monitored for limb weakness, paralysis, and infection, as well as for symptoms of neurogenic pain including limb mutilation. Animals were euthanized 4 weeks after injections.</p><sec><title>&#x003b2;-Gal staining and histology</title><p>For histological analyses, rats were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, I.P.) and transcardially perfused with a 0.9% saline solution, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), pH 7.4. Sciatic nerves, DRGs, and spinal cords were dissected, post-fixed for 24 h, and transferred to a 30% solution of sucrose. Tissues were first processed for &#x003b2;-Gal staining and then frozen in optimal cutting temperature gel (OCT; Sakura Finetek USA) and stored until histological processing. Nerves, DRGs, and spinal cords were cut at 25 &#x003bc;m in transverse sections on a cryostat (Leica Microsystems) and mounted onto slides.

This brought up the issue as to what technique would be most suitable to determine the titers. Currently, there are different measures available to determine lentiviral vector titers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Some of them rely on the number of vector particles present in a vector stock based on strong-stop cDNA or on viral RNA present in virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Others are based on the amount of virus proteins present in vector cores such as p24 Gag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Functional titration assays are based on vector-encoded reporter gene expression. For example, vectors encoding &#x003b2;-Gal have been titrated using X-Gal staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Also significant for titration is the cell line used as receptors for a given pseudotype may vary from cell line to cell line, possibly producing a falsely depressed titer.</p><p>To accurately compare the performance of the various pseudotypes, we tested two different titration protocols to adjust vector MOIs including protocols based on functional titers and protocols based on particle titers.</p><sec><title>Transduction efficiencies of titer-adjusted lentiviral vector pseudotypes using functional titers</title><p>To first determine the efficiency with which these vectors could transduce neuronal cells, we used SH-SY5Y cells. In this experiment, vector MOIs were adjusted based on functional titers (TU). Overall, Rabies PV-pseudotyped vectors performed better than the other pseudotypes in this assay, transducing 20.76 (&#x000b1; 1.1) and 36.78 (&#x000b1; 1.05) % of the cells at MOIs 0.1 and 1, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Moreover, it was interesting to note that only the transduction efficiency of Rabies PV-treated cells significantly increased as a result of a higher MOI (two-way ANOVA, p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Transduction of SH-SY5Y cells using lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with different lyssavirus glycoproteins</bold>.

We were able to consistently reproduce our initial observations throughout the assays and, among all the pseudotypes tested, the Rabies PV virus-derived G glycoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] possessed the best performance and neuronal tropism. We believe that the assays described herein will be generally useful to characterize the retrograde transport characteristics of other pseudotypes in the future.</p><p>Retrograde transport of gene therapy vectors offers a potentially powerful strategy for targeting specific neuronal populations <italic>in vivo</italic>. A variety of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors have been demonstrated to transduce neuronal cells and to undergo retrograde transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In rodents, through direct or peripheral delivery, these studies have compared the CNS transduction patterns of different EIAV- and HIV-1-based vector pseudotypes. Overall, vectors pseudotyped with VSV-G or Rabies virus G-glycoproteins including those from the Evelyn-Rokitnicki-Abelseth (ERA) strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or the challenge virus standard strains CVS, CVS-B2c and CVS-N2c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] were shown to preferentially transduce neurons. However, transduction of astrocytes with ERA-pseudotyped EIAV vectors was also apparent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The main difference reported was the ability of Rabies-G but not VSV-G pseudotyped vectors to undergo retrograde transport to appropriate distal neurons of the lumbar spinal cord after peripheral delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In summary, these results demonstrated that targeted transduction in the CNS can be achieved using specific glycoproteins to pseudotype lentiviral vectors. Moreover, EAIV vectors pseudotyped with the ERA and CVS glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and HIV-1 vectors pseudotyped with the CVS-B2c glycoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] have been proven to be attractive candidates when MNs are the main target. One problem with the above studies is that different assays were used to determine vector titers, making a direct comparison of the results difficult. Some of the assays used involved functional (biological) titers determined on a variety of different cell lines including canine osteosarcoma (D17) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and human 293T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Other assays involved p24 antigen levels determined by ELISA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. While functional titers determined on heterologous cell lines may underestimate vector titers, particle assays based on p24 can be misleading because they do not necessarily reflect intact vector particles only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Based on the transduction experiments conducted with SH-SY5Y, NSC-34 and mixed spinal cord and astrocyte cultures, there appear to be differences among the various pseudotypes tested in terms of cellular tropism, possibly due to differences in the receptors used by the various pseudotypes. A variety of putative cellular receptors have been described for Rabies virus including the acetylcholine receptor and the low-affinity nerve-growth factor receptor (P75NTR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. However, there appear be additional receptors as lentivector pseudotypes bearing Lyssavirus glycoproteins have been shown to be capable of transducing a variety of cell lines and primary cells supposedly lacking the above receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The use of cell specific-promoters can restrict distribution and specific gene expression to the desired populations.</p><p>EIAV-based lentiviral vectors have been recently used to peripherally deliver therapeutic proteins on mouse models of familial ALS and SMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Although successful in young mice, the efficiency of these approaches remains to be determined in larger species. It is currently unknown whether in the context of gene therapy trials in humans these vectors will ultimately be able to transduce a sufficient number of MNs to make a therapeutic impact.

Lentiviral vectors combine the advantages of long-term transgene expression, minimal immunogenicity, ability to accommodate larger transgenes, and the capacity to form pseudotypes with a wide variety of different glycoproteins. Thus, this novel Rabies PV G-pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector might be an important vehicle for remote gene delivery in the treatment of MN diseases, pain, and neuropathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results indicate that HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the Rabies PV glycoprotein might provide important vehicles for CNS targeting by peripheral injection in the treatment of motor neuron diseases, pain, and neuropathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>NB and JR conceived and designed the experiments.
