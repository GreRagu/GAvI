In contrast, survey and cohort studies contain more detailed data from a sample of the population. This paper describes Bayesian graphical models for fitting a common regression model to a combination of data sets with different sets of covariates. The methods are applied to a study of low birth weight and air pollution in England and Wales using a combination of register, survey, and small-area aggregate data. We discuss issues such as multiple imputation of confounding variables missing in one data set, survey selection bias, and appropriate propagation of information between model components. From the register data, there appears to be an association between low birth weight and environmental exposure to NO<sub>2</sub>, but after adjusting for confounding by ethnicity and maternal smoking by combining the register and survey data under our models, we find there is no significant association. However, NO<sub>2</sub> was associated with a small but significant reduction in birth weight, modeled as a continuous variable.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Air pollution</kwd><kwd>Confounding</kwd><kwd>Data synthesis</kwd><kwd>Low birth weight</kwd><kwd>Multiple imputation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><label>1.</label><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><sec><label>1.1.</label><title>Data synthesis in epidemiology</title><p>Studies based on synthesis of data sets of different designs are becoming more common in environmental epidemiology. Observational studies in epidemiology are susceptible to a variety of potential biases, as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greenland (2005)</xref>, who recommended that the effect of each potential bias on the conclusions should be routinely and jointly assessed. Typically, the biases are not identified by the study data, but information can often be gained by incorporating external data. At the same time, precision can be increased by combining data. We consider studies of the relationship between an exposure and an outcome using a combination of 2 commonly used forms of data:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A large administrative data set, such as a census or disease register, which represents the whole population and enables the study of small-scale geographical variations.

In this paper, instead of an aggregate data set, we consider the situation where the large administrative data set is an &#x0201c;individual-level&#x0201d; register which includes the exposure of interest but omits important confounders. The register data are complemented by a smaller survey data set which contains all relevant variables. We use multiple imputation methods, within a Bayesian graphical modeling framework, to analyze jointly the combined data.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gelman <italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref> described similar methods for simultaneously analyzing multiple survey data sets in which some questions are not asked in some surveys. That article was focused on producing a set of multiply imputed data sets for later analysis, with multivariate normal observed and missing data. In this paper, we describe a joint model for imputing the data and fitting a regression model to the imputed data. Our application involves a binary outcome and categorical missing data, but the methods can be implemented for general forms of data using general purpose software.</p></sec><sec><label>1.2.</label><title>General model for jointly analyzing data sets with different variables</title><p>We are interested in a regression of an outcome <bold>y</bold> on a set of <italic>N</italic> covariates <bold>x</bold><sub>1</sub>,&#x02026;,<bold>x</bold><italic><sub>N</sub></italic> when we have 2 or more individual-level data sets.

Firstly, we fit a regression of the <bold>x</bold><sub>(<italic>M</italic><sub>1</sub>)</sub> on <bold>x</bold><sub>(<italic>C</italic>)</sub> using data set 2. Using the <bold>x</bold><sub>(<italic>C</italic>)</sub> in data set 1, we predict from this regression to impute the <bold>x</bold><sub>(<italic>M</italic><sub>1</sub>)</sub> missing in data set 1. Similarly, to predict the <bold>x</bold><sub>(<italic>M</italic><sub>2</sub>)</sub> missing in data set 2, if <bold>x</bold><sub>(<italic>M</italic><sub>2</sub>)</sub> are observed in data set 1, we can use data set 1 to estimate a regression model for <bold>x</bold><sub>(<italic>M</italic><sub>2</sub>)</sub> in terms of <bold>x</bold><sub>(<italic>C</italic>)</sub>.

Some studies have suggested that exposure to air pollution increases the risk of low birth weight, either as a result of preterm delivery or intrauterine growth retardation. Most of these have been based on births registers covering a single city or region in 1 year, for example, S&#x000e3;o Paulo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gouveia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), Vancouver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), Sydney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mannes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The study in this paper is based on the population of England and Wales, which should enable us to examine a relatively wide range of exposures. In UK, the Office for National Statistics maintains a register of all births, to which we can link modeled pollution exposures by postcode of residence (see Section 2.3). However, many major risk factors for low birth weight, such as ethnicity or maternal age, are either not recorded or not made available in the register. Therefore, we obtain detailed confounder information from a survey of births, the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS).</p><p>There are 2 important sources of potential bias. Bias due to confounding by variables absent from the register data can be alleviated by an imputation model for the missing covariates, constructed using the survey data. Inferences from the survey data are also subject to selection bias. This can be alleviated by adjusting models for known factors affecting selection or by weighting observations by the inverse probability of selection, which is known by design. We could consider analyzing the survey data alone, since all relevant variables are observed, and pollution exposure estimates can be linked by postcode. However, inferences from the survey data alone lack power to detect the small risk increases expected for environmental exposures, typically a few percent for a population quartile of a continuous exposure (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gouveia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). We will demonstrate how the graphical modeling framework described in Section 1.2 can incorporate all data sources, controlling biases and improving precision. Bayesian estimation of the joint model ensures that uncertainties are propagated appropriately between different model components.</p><p>Section 2 describes our data sources in more detail. Section 3 describes how the model presented in Section 1.2 is specified and implemented to estimate the association between low birth weight and pollution. Section 4 presents the results, including a range of sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of each source of data and each component of the model. Finally, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the methods and suggest some ideas for further development.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>2.</label><title>D<sc>ATA</sc></title><sec><label>2.1.</label><title>National births register</title><p>The UK register of births (Office for National Statistics) recorded 579 267 singleton births in England and Wales between September 1, 2000, and August 30, 2001. Information available for every birth includes date of birth, birth weight, sex, and postcode. Social class and employment status of the mother are available for a 10% random sample of every 10th registered birth and we study only this subset of 57 844 births. A total of 1231 individuals who also appeared in the MCS, ascertained by a match on postcode, date of birth, sex, and birth weight, were excluded from the register data. Also, 88 births with missing birth weight were excluded, leaving 56 525 births for analysis.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2.</label><title>Millennium Cohort Study</title><p>The MCS (Centre for Longitudinal Studies, 2000&#x02013;2005) covers 18 819 babies born between September 1, 2000, and August 30, 2001, in the UK. We include only the 14 100 singleton births from England and Wales. Births with postcodes of residence which could not be linked to pollution data, due to incomplete pollution mapping or inaccurate recording of postcodes in the MCS, were excluded, leaving 13 131 births for analysis. The distribution of birth weight was similar between the included and the excluded births.</p><p>The MCS was cluster-sampled by electoral wards, areas containing an average of around 5000 individuals. Wards in England were stratified into mutually exclusive categories labeled &#x0201c;advantaged&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;disadvantaged&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;high ethnic minority&#x0201d;, and wards in Wales were stratified into categories labeled advantaged and disadvantaged. A different proportion of wards were sampled from each stratum to achieve adequate representation of each stratum. All families in the sampled wards with children born in the relevant period, resident in the UK at 9 months, were invited to participate. Response rates averaged 70%, but varied by stratum, with the lowest response rate of about 60% in the ethnic minority wards. Variables from the MCS which we consider include birth weight, sex, ethnicity, tobacco smoking during pregnancy, maternal age, parity (number of previous births), height and weight, and socioeconomic characteristics of the mother, including social class, employment status, lone parent, and education over age 16.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3.</label><title>Pollution exposure</title><p>Estimated background maps of ambient concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, for 2001, on a 1-km grid, were obtained from the National Environmental Technology Centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stedman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). These were modeled from point sources such as power stations, line sources such as road traffic, and monitoring sites, using a dispersion matrix approach. Pollution estimates from 54 517 grid squares in England and Wales were attributed to 566 932 postcodes using area-weighting techniques. The births register and MCS data were linked by postcode to the annual mean pollution concentration for the year (2000 or 2001) in which the nominal date of the middle of pregnancy (140 days prior to birth) falls. Concentrations for the year 2000 were estimated by adjusting the 2001 concentrations by published scaling factors (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK, 2003), calculated from estimated changes in road traffic emissions, which decreased from 2000 to 2001.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4.</label><title>Aggregate data</title><p>Some important risk factors for low birth weight are not available from the births register, in particular, ethnic group and tobacco smoking, which are likely to be confounded with air pollution exposure. An imputation model is fitted to individual ethnicity and smoking from the MCS data and subsequently used to predict these variables for the births in the register. To inform this model, geographical aggregate data on these variables were obtained. Neighborhood smoking behavior and ethnicity are expected to be good predictors of their individual-level equivalents. The proportion of the resident population in each of 4 ethnic groups (white, South Asian, black, other) for 46 548 census output areas (areas containing around 200&#x02013;300 individuals) were obtained from the 2001 UK census. Estimated annual tobacco expenditures, by 2001 census output areas, were obtained from consumer classification data (CACI Information Solutions, Limited). These were linked by postcode to all individuals in the MCS and register.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5.</label><title>Consistency of data sources: selection bias</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> presents a summary of the variables common to the MCS and administrative (either register or aggregate) data. The differences between the administrative and the survey data reflect how the MCS data are not a random sample of the population. However, when the MCS data are summarized using the published survey weights, which are inversely proportional to the proportion of wards sampled in each stratum, the distributions of all variables except social class and employment are consistent with the population summary. The different distribution of social class and employment between the MCS and the register, even after reweighting the MCS, is likely to be caused by inaccurate recording of these variables in the register, rather than selection bias&#x02014;since the summary of social class and employment from the reweighted MCS was consistent with 1991 UK census data for women between the ages of 12 and 60. The binary smoking status reported by the MCS cannot be directly compared to area-level mean tobacco expenditures.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Summary of register, ecological, MCS data, and MCS data weighted to represent the population.

Secondly, we assume the remaining subjects (ignoring the 2% of those who also appeared in the MCS) are selected at random from the remaining population, which we consider to be a sixth sampling stratum. This sampling design is accounted for in the model for low birth weight by adjusting for the stratum as a covariate. Other covariates in our model, including ethnicity and social class, are assumed to be sufficient to adjust for nonresponse within the MCS sampling strata.</p><p>The sample selection mechanism must also be accounted for in the model we use to impute the missing ethnicity and smoking data in the register. The combination of the MCS and register is considered as a single data set in which the births which came from the register have these covariates missing. These can be modeled using multiple imputation. By adjusting the imputation model for the variables governing selection into the MCS, we can assume a &#x0201c;missing-at-random&#x0201d; mechanism for these variables since missingness is equivalent to inclusion in the portion of the data set which came from the register rather than the MCS.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3.</label><title>M<sc>ODELS</sc></title><p>Two regression models are estimated in parallel using the combined data: a &#x0201c;model of interest&#x0201d; for the relationship of low birth weight to pollution exposure, and an &#x0201c;imputation model&#x0201d; for 2 potential confounders of this relationship, ethnicity, and smoking, which are missing from the register data but available from the MCS.</p><sec><label>3.1.</label><title>Model of interest for low birth weight</title><p>Suppose baby <italic>i</italic> from ward <italic>k</italic> in the MCS has low&#x02013;birth weight indicator <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic><italic>k</italic></sub>.

Fitting a similar model (model (3.1)) to the MCS data, adjusting for ethnicity and smoking status, suggests that this apparent association is the result of confounding&#x02014;that there is no association of low birth weight with NO<sub>2</sub> conditionally on ethnicity and smoking. Most studies of low birth weight and pollution have been conducted using birth registers. Our analysis suggests that a misleading result would have arisen given only the UK register, in which we are unable to control for confounding. However, the lack of association with pollution in the MCS may just reflect lack of power, therefore we strengthen our conclusions by combining the MCS and register data under the imputation model.</p></sec><sec><label>4.2.</label><title>Benefit of combining the administrative and survey data</title><p>The estimated odds ratio for NO<sub>2</sub> under the full model (3.1), (3.2) and (3.4), combining the MCS and register data, integrating over the missing individual ethnicity and smoking data in the register is 0.98 (0.91, 1.04), demonstrating an increase in precision compared to the MCS alone. Similar increases in precision are shown for all other covariate effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Note that the increasing risk of low birth weight with decreasing levels of social class now appears significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, &#x0201c;Combined&#x0201d; result compared to &#x0201c;MCS&#x0201d;). A similar odds ratio for the NO<sub>2</sub> effect of 0.97 (0.90, 1.03) is obtained using the outcome data from the register data alone (model 3.2), but controlling for confounding using the imputation model (3.4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that the main role of the MCS is to inform the imputation model, while the model of interest is dominated by the register data. For SO<sub>2</sub>, the odds ratio from the combined data is 1.02 (0.98, 1.05). Thus, the evidence for lack of an association of either pollutant with low birth weight has been strengthened by combining the register and survey data.</p><p>The posterior distribution of the deviance ( &#x02212; 2&#x000d7; log-likelihood) was calculated for the MCS and register outcomes separately in the model which combined the two, as a measure of model fit.

An additional model was fitted to the MCS data which ignored confounding by smoking and ethnicity. The estimated odds ratios are similar to those obtained from the same model fitted to the register data alone (first row of Table 3, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/kxn041/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link>, available at <italic>Biostatistics</italic> online), but with wider credible intervals. The consistency between the MCS and the population register results suggests that the selection and nonresponse mechanisms in the MCS do not bias the association between pollution and low birth weight. A further model was fitted to the combined data and the MCS alone, excluding social class as a predictor of low birth weight. In both cases, the posterior mean odds ratios and credible limits for NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> (not presented) were less than 1% different from those obtained from the model including social class, suggesting that the poor quality of the social class data from the register (discussed in Section 2.5) did not affect the conclusions.</p></sec><sec><label>4.4.</label><title>Influence of the imputation model</title><p>The main assumption of this data synthesis is that the imputation model is able to impute the ethnicity and smoking data in the register with sufficient accuracy to control for their confounding effects. We now assess the influence of the imputation model, the choice of predictors in the imputation model, and the amount of power lost by propagating the imputation uncertainty.</p><p>Firstly, we assess roughly how many predictors of individual ethnicity and smoking are required from the population data to control for their confounding effects. Our main imputation model uses all available predictors. When the aggregate ethnicity and tobacco data are omitted from this model, so that it depends only on individual-level variables (low birth weight, NO<sub>2</sub> exposure, SO<sub>2</sub> exposure, social class, and unemployment), there is a 5% change in the odds ratio for NO<sub>2</sub> and a greater change in the confounder odds ratios (fifth row of Table 3, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/kxn041/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link> available at <italic>Biostatistics</italic> online). With NO<sub>2</sub> also omitted from the imputation model, the biases are greater: the odds ratios in the model of interest are close to those from the register data unadjusted for confounders. Thus, confounding can be controlled to some extent without the auxiliary aggregate data on the confounders, by including a sufficient number of individual predictors of the confounders, provided that the exposures of interest are included in the imputation model.</p><p>Secondly, the relative influence of the &#x0201c;observed&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;imputed&#x0201d; confounder data on the model of interest is assessed. The full model was fitted to the combined data, but with the observed confounders in the MCS replaced by multiply imputed values. The odds ratios (ninth row of Table 2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/kxn041/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link> available at <italic>Biostatistics</italic> online) are similar to those with the observed confounders (third row) suggesting that the imputations are consistent with the observed data.</p><p>By combining the data, uncertainty is reduced by increasing the sample size, but at the cost of extra uncertainty about the imputed covariate data, which is propagated by the MCMC scheme. The posterior variance of the log-odds ratio for NO<sub>2</sub> is 0.00840 from the MCS only. If the data are combined but imputation uncertainty is ignored, using a single random imputation of the confounders in the register, this variance reduces to 0.00102, about 12% of the variance under the MCS. Propagating the uncertainty only increases this variance to 0.00109, about 13% of the variance under the MCS.</p></sec><sec><label>4.5.</label><title>Benefit of cutting the dependency on birth weight</title><p>The full model was also fitted to the combined data with the graph not cut as described in Section 3.4.

This warns against applying a graphical model na&#x000ef;vely without considering whether its structure implicitly provides information about certain nodes.</p></sec><sec><label>4.6.</label><title>Substantive interpretation</title><p>We conclude that in England and Wales there is a large increase in risk of low birth weight associated with maternal smoking (odds ratio [OR] 1.93 [1.79, 2.09]), South Asian ethnic groups (OR 2.6 [2.3, 2.91]), Black ethnic groups (OR 1.78 [1.5, 2.1]), other ethnic minorities (OR 1.55 [1.28, 1.84]), and decreasing social class. Conditionally on these factors, there does not seem to be an effect of exposure to environmental NO<sub>2</sub> or SO<sub>2</sub>. These results are not inconsistent with the literature on the effects of pollution exposure on birth weight. While there are several studies suggesting associations between NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, CO, and SO<sub>2</sub> exposure and adverse birth outcomes, these vary in the definition of the exposure and outcome studied and the nature of the association. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mannes <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> found an association of CO and NO<sub>2</sub> exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy with all birth weight in Sydney and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gouveia <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> found an association of PM<sub>10</sub> and CO exposure (but not NO<sub>2</sub>) in the first trimester with low birth weight for gestational age in S&#x000e3;o Paulo, whereas Hansen <italic>et al.</italic> (2007) found no association of NO<sub>2</sub> or PM<sub>10</sub> exposure with a reduction in birth weight in Brisbane.</p><sec><title/><sec><title>Birth outcomes.</title><p>The outcome used in our study was low birth weight at all gestational ages. However, the aetiology of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction (resulting in low full-term birth weight) is different. The gestational age of each birth is required to distinguish between these 2 outcomes. This is available from the MCS but not from register data. To investigate possible effects on each of these outcomes separately, we fitted standard logistic regression models to the MCS data alone, adjusting for individual ethnicity, smoking, and social class. Around 43% of low&#x02013;birth weight babies in the MCS were full term ( &#x02265; 37 weeks gestational age). The associations of NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> with low full-term birth weight are similar to those for all low birth weight, and the effects of smoking and ethnicity are stronger (Tables 2 and 3, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/kxn041/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link> available at <italic>Biostatistics</italic> online). The only significant predictor of preterm birth was maternal smoking. There does not appear to be an association of preterm birth with pollution exposure. The findings of lack of an association of either outcome with pollution are inconclusive, although there is no strong evidence to suggest important differences in effect according to gestational age. In Molitor <italic>et al.</italic> (2008), we propose an extension of the current modeling framework to impute missing information on gestational age in the register.</p><p>We study low birth weight, defined as less than 2.5 kg, since this is established as an important public health indicator (United Nations Children's Fund and World Health Organization, 2004). As an alternative to a dichotomous outcome, we consider modeling birth weight as a continuous variable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wilcox and Russell (1983)</xref> characterized the population distribution of birth weight as a mixture of a predominant normal distribution and a heavy tail, representing full-term and preterm births, respectively. We fit a mixture of 2 normal distributions to our combined birth weight data, adjusted for the same variables as models (3.1) and (3.2). Uninformative priors were used for the component membership probability and the component-specific means and variances, with an ordering constraint on the component means. The regression coefficients were constrained to be the same between components&#x02014;allowing them to vary did not improve fit, judging from an increase in the posterior mean deviance. Under this model, there is a change of &#x02212; 31 g ( &#x02212; 40 g, &#x02212; 23 g) associated with a change in NO<sub>2</sub> equal to its interquartile range, similarly 1.1 g ( &#x02212; 3.6 g, 5.8 g) for SO<sub>2</sub>. The significant association of NO<sub>2</sub> with reduction in birth weight contrasts with the results obtained when dichotomizing birth weight. However, the association is small compared to the population mean birth weight of 3374 g and the &#x0201c;low&#x02013;birth weight&#x0201d; threshold (about the 6.3% percentile) of 2500 g.</p></sec><sec><title>Exposure measurement error and variability.</title><p>Now, consider the nature of the exposure data in our study. Firstly, the potential impact of measurement error should be considered. The only exposure data we have are modeled annual pollution concentrations in 2000 and 2001 by postcode of residence. These are proxies for the true individual exposures. The true exposures are likely to have higher variance than the observed data (Berkson error), and there is no reason to believe that errors are differential. Thus, while measurement error is likely to reduce power, it is not expected to cause bias in estimated exposure effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zeger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>. To investigate these impacts, we performed a sensitivity analysis. In the model for the combined data, the observed NO<sub>2</sub> exposure <bold>x</bold><sub><italic>i</italic><italic>k</italic>1</sub> was replaced by the unknown true exposure <bold>x</bold><sub><italic>i</italic><italic>k</italic>1</sub><sup>(true)</sup> and a Berkson error model was assumed:<disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="biostskxn041fx5_ht.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>The measurement error standard deviation was defined as <italic>&#x003c9;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5&#x003bb;<inline-graphic xlink:href="biostskxn041fx6_ht.jpg"/>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="biostskxn041fx6_ht.jpg"/></inline-formula> is the empirical mean exposure in the combined data, representing the belief that the true value varies within about &#x000b1;100<italic>&#x003bb;</italic>% of the observed value. The observed SO<sub>2</sub> exposure was modeled in the same way. For values of <italic>&#x003bb;</italic> up to 1, the estimated odds ratios and their credible limits were within 1% of the estimates with <italic>&#x003bb;</italic> = 0, suggesting that measurement error within plausible limits did not affect the power of our analysis.</p><p>Secondly, the impact of temporal variations in the exposure should be considered. While our annual mean exposure data only enable us to determine the effect of long-term exposure rather than specific effects in different months of pregnancy, we can investigate seasonal variations. Concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> were lower in 2001 and are generally higher in winter months (December to February in UK) when the air is cool and stable. Births are approximately uniformly distributed in the data by season. To assess whether there is some seasonal component to the risk of low birth weight after adjusting for annual background concentrations, we fitted the combined model including an extra term for season of birth (categorized as September 2000&#x02013;November 2000, December 2000&#x02013;February 2001, March 2001&#x02013;May 2001, June 2001&#x02013;August 2001). Small seasonal variations were observed with the lightest births in winter and summer. Relative to a baseline of September&#x02013;November, the odds ratio for low birth weight for birth in December&#x02013;February was 1.09 (1.00, 1.18), for March&#x02013;May 1.04 (0.95, 1.14), and for June&#x02013;August 1.07 (0.99, 1.17). Lower birth weights in summer may be related to pollution exposure during pregnancy in the winter, although it has been suggested that low temperatures during mid-pregnancy may directly affect foetal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Murray <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><label>5.</label><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>Multiple imputation methods, which are more commonly used for intermittent nonresponse within single data sets, can also be used to combine data in situations where some variables are missing by design in particular data sets. In this paper, we presented and applied a model for combining data sets with different sets of variables, generalizing the model presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gelman <italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref> to include estimation of regression relationships on the imputed data and general forms of observed and missing data, both discrete and continuous. The graphical modeling framework enables a joint probability distribution for the combined data, in which uncertainties from one model component are taken account of in other components. It is easily extensible and can be implemented in general purpose software. For example, the multiple imputation methods could be extended, in the way described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gelman <italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref>, to deal with situations in which several individual data sets are modeled, some with certain variables completely absent and others with intermittent nonresponse. Survey-level covariates may be needed to explain systematic biases from each survey, and a hierarchical model may be needed to represent the correlation structure. However, in routine application of graphical models, the structure of the influence relationships must be considered carefully, as we showed by demonstrating the need for &#x0201c;cutting&#x0201d; the dependency of the missing covariates on the observed outcome.</p><p>A similar situation of synthesizing data sets with different sets of covariates arises in &#x0201c;2-phase&#x0201d; or 2-stage designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">White, 1982</xref>). These are used to improve efficiency, commonly of case&#x02013;control studies, in situations where covariate collection is expensive. Individuals are classified into strata defined by combinations of an outcome and an exposure of interest, and samples of individuals are selected from each stratum for further covariate collection. By oversampling from the smaller strata and using appropriate methods for inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Breslow and Holubkov, 1997</xref>,), efficiency can be increased. Only the smaller of the 2 data sets, with full covariate information, is analyzed directly, but the information on the exposure-outcome relationship in the larger data set is used indirectly when constructing a model to account for the sampling design. In this paper, we have described how this information can be used directly, in a situation where the design of the smaller data set is not based on the larger data set. The improvement in power comes from constructing an expanded data set on which to estimate the model, rather than from the design of the sample.</p><p>By synthesizing data from different sources, inferences can be improved. In our application, we were able to make the most of the strengths of each data set: the large sample size of the administrative data and the more detailed covariate collection of the survey data. However, any analysis of combinations of data, including meta-analysis, is not recommended when the data sets being combined are too heterogeneous. Here, &#x0201c;heterogeneity&#x0201d; is used as a general term encompassing differences in study design, different variables collected, differences in the underlying populations, or systematically different responses to variables which are nominally the same. Ideally, the reasons for heterogeneity should be represented as extra parameters in the model. If these are not identifiable from data, then hierarchical models, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gelman <italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref>, can often help to account for the extra uncertainty incurred by combining the data sets. But if the data sets are too heterogeneous, this extra uncertainty will lose any advantage gained by combining them. For example, if covariates are missing in one data set, then there needs to be sufficient complete data in other data sets to enable their imputation. In our application, if sufficient predictors of individual smoking and ethnicity had not been available from population data, then data synthesis would have been futile. Further work in this area should focus on &#x0201c;calibrating&#x0201d; specific methods of data synthesis to assess the potential benefit of the synthesis before analysis. For example, this may involve determining the amount of covariate information required to inform a multiple imputation before the imputation gives any benefit.</p></sec><sec><title>F<sc>UNDING</sc></title><p><grant-sponsor>Economic and Social Research Council</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>RES-576-25-5003</grant-num>); <grant-sponsor>Department of Health</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>PHI/03/C1/045</grant-num>).
