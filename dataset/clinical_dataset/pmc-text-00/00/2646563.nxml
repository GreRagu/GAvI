However, their frequency and function are poorly understood because no known surface markers distinguish them from older non-RTE naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We demonstrate that protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) is a novel marker for human CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs. Consistent with their recent thymic origin, human PTK7<sup>+</sup> RTEs contained higher levels of signal joint TCR gene excision circles and were more responsive to interleukin (IL)-7 compared with PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and rapidly decreased after complete thymectomy. Importantly, CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs proliferated less and produced less IL-2 and interferon-&#x003b3; than PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-TCR/CD3 and CD28 engagement. This immaturity in CD4<sup>+</sup> RTE effector function may contribute to the reduced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity observed in contexts in which CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs predominate, such as in the fetus and neonate or after immune reconstitution. The ability to identify viable CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs by PTK7 staining should be useful for monitoring thymic output in both healthy individuals and in patients with genetic or acquired CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell immunodeficiencies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are essential for adaptive immune responses to pathogens and vaccines. Relatively constant numbers of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are maintained throughout life by both the thymic output of CD4<sup>+</sup> recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) and by homeostatic proliferation of existing peripheral naive T cells, which replace those cells lost by death or conversion to memory/effector cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). The relative contribution of thymic output and homeostatic proliferation to the composition of the human naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell pool throughout aging has been difficult to determine precisely.</p><p>Frequencies of human CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs have been inferred by PCR assays of populations of cells for their content of signal joint TCR gene excision circles (sjTRECs), which are circular DNA products of intrathymic V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). However, using sjTREC content to study RTE abundance and biology has important disadvantages. First, homeostatic proliferation results in increased sjTREC loss from the naive peripheral T cell compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Second, sjTREC content is not a highly dynamic measurement of thymic output, as is indicated by its stability for months after complete thymectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Third, PCR analysis of sjTREC content precludes any type of functional analysis of viable CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs at the single-cell level. Although other approaches allow direct in vivo labeling of RTEs in humans, such as with <sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), they also do not allow a facile determination of RTE phenotype and function. Thus, identifying an endogenous surface marker for RTEs would overcome the disadvantages of sjTREC assays or of in vivo labeling with stable isotopes.</p><p>An understanding of RTE biology in humans is also of clinical interest, as studies in rodents have suggested impaired RTE function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). If this immaturity also applies to human RTEs, this could limit T cell effector function when RTEs likely predominate in the naive T cell compartment, such as in the neonate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) and in older individuals undergoing immune reconstitution, e.g., after highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). In this paper, we have identified protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) as a surface marker for human CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs that allows enumeration of their frequency and analysis of their function.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Identification of PTK7 as a putative CD4<sup>+</sup> RTE marker</title><p>To identify surface markers on human CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs, we compared the gene expression profiles of postnatal mature CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes and circulating neonatal and adult naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We reasoned that neonatal naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were enriched in RTEs compared with adult naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, as they contained higher levels of sjTRECs than adult naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We also hypothesized that peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs, but not adult naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, continued to express a subset of genes expressed by mature CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes because CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs have recently completed thymocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we generated a complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray of &#x0223c;2,500 targets in which the transcript abundance of these three T cell populations was compared (unpublished data). Using quantitative real-time PCR, we confirmed that transcripts for PTK7, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), were expressed at higher levels by CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes and neonatal CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared with adult naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>sjTREC levels and PTK7 expression decrease with T cell maturation.</bold> (A and B) sjTREC content (A) and PTK7 mRNA expression (B) of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes, neonatal CD45RA<sup>high</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and adult naive (CD45RA<sup>high</sup>) and memory (CD45RA<sup>low</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

This specificity was verified by analysis of a human PTK7-EGFP cDNA-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line and Jurkat CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T-lineage tumor cells, which express high levels of PTK7 messenger RNA (mRNA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>).

The highest expression was observed on the least mature triple-negative (CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) thymocyte subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) and their immediate derivatives, the immature single-positive (CD3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). PTK7 surface expression progressively decreased as thymocytes subsequently transited from the double-positive (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>) to the most mature single-positive (CD3<sup>high</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or CD3<sup>high</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>) stage of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Mouse thymocytes, like human thymocytes, also exhibited a progressive decrease in PTK7 expression with maturation (Fig. S1).</p></sec><sec><title>Age-dependent frequency of PTK7-expressing peripheral naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</title><p>If PTK7 represents a marker for human CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs, then a fraction of peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells should continue to express it after their export from the thymus. Indeed, we observed a distinct PTK7<sup>+</sup> subset of &#x0223c;10% of antigenically naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from adult peripheral blood, as defined by their CD45RA<sup>high</sup>CD45RO<sup>low</sup> surface phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). As predicted by earlier results of PTK7 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), the neonatal naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population consistently contained a higher percentage of PTK7<sup>+</sup> cells than the analogous adult population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) and a higher amount of protein per cell, based on mean fluorescence intensity values (not depicted). An examination of 22 different healthy donors ranging in age between 1 mo and 61 yr demonstrated that the frequency of PTK7<sup>+</sup> cells among naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>) and the absolute number of PTK7<sup>+</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080996/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080996/DC1</ext-link>) progressively and significantly decreased with age. This decline appeared to be biphasic, with a more rapid phase in early childhood, followed by a subsequent slower but progressive decrease with aging, and is similar to the pattern of exponential rather than linear decay of RTEs with aging reported in nonhuman vertebrates, including rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). These findings are consistent with the possibility that PTK7<sup>+</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells represent RTEs, as thymic cellularity and, likely, RTE production also peak in early childhood followed by a progressive decline with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>PTK7 is expressed on a subset of circulating naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that decreases with age and that has a surface phenotype similar to PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive cells.</bold> (A) PTK7 staining (solid line) and isotype staining (dashed line) of circulating naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from a term gestation neonate, a 4-yr-old child, and an adult, or of adult memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

(C) Surface expression of PTK7 versus the indicated T cell markers by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (representative result of three donors).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20080996_RGB_Fig2"/></fig><p>In contrast to the results for thymocytes and naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, neither PTK7 transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>) nor surface PTK7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) were detectable in adult memory CD45RA<sup>low</sup>(CD45RO<sup>high</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). This suggests that PTK7 surface protein was lost during postthymic conversion of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into memory cells. We did not detect inducible expression of PTK7 by PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after in vitro stimulation with CD3 and CD28 mAbs (unpublished data), indicating that this protein was not up-regulated by T cell activation. PTK7<sup>+</sup> and PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had similar surface levels of &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-TCR, CD3, CD5, CD28, CD38, CD62-L, and IL-7R&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>) and diversity of the &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-TCR repertoire (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080996/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080996/DC1</ext-link>). These findings are also consistent with the PTK7<sup>+</sup> subset representing an RTE precursor of PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. PTK7 expression was not detected on circulating human adult CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, including the reported CD103<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> RTE subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells, &#x003b3;&#x003b4;-TCR<sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells, or NK cells (Fig. S4 and not depicted).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunological phenotype of circulating PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs and their postthymic maturation</title><p>Next, we determined whether these putative PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs exhibited the expected pattern of expression of markers characteristic for naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. For example, most adult circulating naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are CD31<sup>+</sup>, but a CD31<sup>&#x02212;</sup> subset has lower sjTREC content and less &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-TCR diversity than the CD31<sup>+</sup> fraction and may be generated by foreign antigen-independent homeostatic proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). We found that adult PTK7<sup>+</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were uniformly CD31<sup>+</sup>, which is consistent with this population representing a precursor of the CD31<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cell subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). As sjTRECs are diluted in peripheral T cells by postthymic mitosis, such as homeostatic or activation-induced proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), we predicted that if PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are bona fide RTEs, then they should, like CD31<sup>+</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, have a higher sjTREC content compared with the CD31<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that have undergone homeostatic proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). We found that the PTK7<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> putative RTEs contained high levels of sjTRECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>), and the PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD31<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells had extremely low levels of sjTRECs, which is similar to those of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Interestingly, the sjTREC content of PTK7<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was also substantially and consistently higher than that of PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> naive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). For eight individuals ranging in age between 4 and 55 yr, the mean ratio &#x000b1; SD of the sjTREC content of PTK7<sup>+</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> cells to that of PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was 2.66 &#x000b1; 0.80, and this ratio did not significantly change with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These findings were consistent with PTK7 representing a marker for CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs at all ages tested, and this consistency of higher sjTREC content in PTK7<sup>+</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells contrasts with the sjTREC content of CD31<sup>+</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells overall, which has been reported to decline with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). This suggests that PTK7<sup>+</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which are hereafter referred to as PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs, have undergone fewer cell divisions in the periphery than their PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> counterparts, including CD31<sup>+</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Assuming that the PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs are an obligatory precursor of PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, this indicates that normal postthymic CD4<sup>+</sup> RTE maturation includes mitosis that, in contrast with CD31<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells that have undergone homeostatic proliferation, maintains CD31 expression and a diverse &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-TCR repertoire.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Circulating PTK7<sup>+</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are uniformly CD31<sup>+</sup>, contain higher sjTREC levels than CD31<sup>+</sup> or CD31<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells lacking PTK7, and persistently decline after thymectomy.</bold> (A) CD31 and PTK7 surface expression by circulating adult CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of the CD45RA<sup>+</sup> (naive) and CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (memory) subsets (representative result of four donors).

In a 2-yr-old and a 14-yr-old patient, there was a marked decline in both the frequency and circulating numbers of PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs at 10 or 12 wk after surgery, respectively, and these remained low at the second postsurgical time point, 34 or 24 wk, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Although the circulating numbers of both PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and total naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells also declined at the first postthymectomy time point, these rebounded to near presurgical levels by the second postsurgical time point, whereas, in contrast, PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs did not. Analysis of a healthy 5-yr-old individual showed that the PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTE population remained stable over a 12-wk period, indicating that the alterations observed after thymectomy were not attributable to random biological variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these findings are consistent with the following: (a) the direct and recent production of PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs by the thymus; (b) an inability of extrathymic sources to replenish this cell population; and (c) a relatively short half-life of PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs as a result of either their conversion to PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and/or their loss by cell death. The fraction of PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs that are converted into PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells versus those that die in the periphery while expressing surface PTK7 remains uncertain. Future in vivo labeling studies might be informative in better quantifying the precursor&#x02013;product relationship between circulating PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs and PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>To determine if PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs can proliferate in an antigen-independent manner to become PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, sorted PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs were CFSE labeled and cultured in vitro with a combination of cytokines to induce proliferation independent of &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-TCR/CD3 engagement. After 7 d of culture, surface CD31 levels were either unchanged or only slightly diminished, which is similar to the pattern previously described for naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). In contrast, surface PTK7 levels expressed by the RTEs substantially and progressively declined with each round of mitosis (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080996/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080996/DC1</ext-link>). These results support a precursor&#x02013;product relationship in which PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs undergo proliferation by a mechanism independent of &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-TCR/CD3 engagement and convert to a PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cell population with lower sjTREC content while retaining a CD31<sup>high</sup> naive surface phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunological function of PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs</title><p>As previous studies have shown that mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs do not fully respond to &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-TCR/CD3 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), we next determined if human CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs also had functional limitations. FACS-purified human PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs activated using a combination of CD3 and CD28 mAbs coupled to beads (&#x003b1;CD3/&#x003b1;CD28 beads) had substantially less incorporation of <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine, reduced mitosis in a CFSE assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), and decreased blastogenesis compared with their PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). Reduced mitosis using the CFSE assay was also observed with 0.03 and 0.01 beads/cell at both 48 and 72 h (unpublished data).

We compared their proliferative responses after either staining with PTK7 antibody or an isotype-matched control antibody followed by staining with a secondary fluorochrome antibody before &#x003b1;CD3/&#x003b1;CD28 bead stimulation and found no inhibition of their proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>).

Previous work has shown that IL-7, which plays a critical role in thymocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), induces greater proliferation of mature single-positive thymocytes than peripheral T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Here, IL-7 treatment induced higher levels of proliferation of PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs compared with PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). This greater proliferation to IL-7 was unlikely to be an artifact of PTK7 antibody staining, as neonatal naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells proliferated similarly to IL-7 after staining with PTK7 antibody or isotype control antibody or no staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). These results are consistent with PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs having a thymocyte-like functional phenotype of increased IL-7 responsiveness. The mechanism for this increased IL-7 responsiveness remains unclear, but is not accounted for by higher surface levels of IL-7R&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether decreased proliferation by PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs reflected a generalized limitation in T cell activation, we compared this cell type and PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells for surface expression of activation-dependent proteins and the production of cytokines. Activated PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs expressed similar surface levels of CD25, CD69, and CD154 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>) and had similar frequencies of TNF-&#x003b1; secreting cells as PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). In contrast, IL-2 expression at the single cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>) and in terms of overall secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>) was markedly reduced for these cells compared with PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, the addition of exogenous recombinant IL-2 to PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs completely increased their proliferation to levels comparable to those of PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, suggesting that RTEs have the capacity to fully respond to IL-2 stimulation but lack the ability to produce IL-2 in sufficient quantities for a full response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). In contrast, both reduced IL-2 and IL-2 receptor expression may limit the activation of mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).

Thus, despite the conserved pattern of PTK7 expression in thymocytes, there may be substantial species-related differences in its peripheral T cell expression. Although PTK7 has been implicated in planar cell polarity during central nervous system embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), its function in T cell development remains unclear.</p><p>In summary, PTK7 is a novel marker for the measurement of circulating human CD4<sup>+</sup> RTEs, which have impaired immune function compared with more mature naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The findings of a more pronounced and persistent loss of PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> than PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after complete thymectomy, and the higher sjTREC content of PTK7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> compared with PTK7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, also suggest that PTK7 may identify RTEs that are more recently produced by the thymus than does CD31. Clinical contexts in which measurement of thymic output based on PTK7 surface staining might be useful include treatment with cytotoxic agents, HIV infection, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and primary immunodeficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>).
