Short recombinogenic regions (hotspots) are interspersed between large relatively non-recombinogenic regions. This raises the interesting possibility of DNA sequence and/or other <italic>cis</italic>- elements as determinants of recombination. We hypothesized the involvement of non-canonical sequences that can result in local non-B DNA structures and tested this using the G-quadruplex DNA as a model. G-quadruplex or G4 DNA is a unique form of four-stranded non-B DNA structure that engages certain G-rich sequences, presence of such motifs has been noted within telomeres. In support of this hypothesis, genome-wide computational analyses presented here reveal enrichment of <underline>p</underline>otential <underline>G4</underline> (PG4) DNA forming sequences within 25618 human hotspots relative to 9290 coldspots (p&#x0003c;0.0001). Furthermore, co-occurrence of PG4 DNA within several short sequence elements that are associated with recombinogenic regions was found to be significantly more than randomly expected. Interestingly, analyses of more than 50 DNA binding factors revealed that co-occurrence of PG4 DNA with target DNA binding sites of transcription factors c-Rel, NF-kappa B (p50 and p65) and Evi-1 was significantly enriched in recombination-prone regions. These observations support involvement of G4 DNA in recombination, predicting a functional model that is consistent with duplex-strand separation induced by formation of G4 motifs in supercoiled DNA and/or when assisted by other cellular factors.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA in its double-stranded form (B-DNA conformation) is a critical genetic component for most organisms. Therefore, it is central to cellular function that strict control over integrity of the large and complex DNA molecule is maintained under constant challenge from a variety of factors. These include not only external environmental abuse (like chemicals and radiation) that lead to mutagenesis but also changes that are inherent to the double-stranded DNA form itself. Indeed, several forms of non-B DNA structural conformations resulting from repeat sequences have been demonstrated to be mutagenic and cause hereditary disorders (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Wells1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Mirkin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). Several different non-B DNA forms have been reported to have functional consequence; these include cruciforms, triplexes, slipped structures, G-quadruplex, left-handed Z DNA and bent DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Sinden1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Wyman1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. It is believed that formation of non-B DNA conformations (inherently of high energy states) is supported by duplex destabilization resulting from negative supercoiling induced by multiple cellular processes including transcription, replication and also protein binding. Apart from this, in specific instances non-B DNA conformations have been mechanistically linked to recombination-related events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Modesti1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Bacolla1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

Using computational methods, sequence patterns with potential to form G4 DNA were mapped within 32996 hotspots and corresponding flanking regions in human. We found that potential G4 (PG4) DNA forming sequences were significantly enriched within hotspots, while a control sequence that would not adopt structure was not differentially distributed. We also tested and found that within a 50 bp distance PG4 DNA co-occurrence with previously reported short sequence motifs (with enriched presence in hotspots) was significantly higher than expected randomly. Interestingly, testing the association of PG4 DNA with &#x0003e;50 transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) within the hotspots revealed significant co-occurrence with target sites for three factors &#x02013; c-Rel, NF-kappa B (p50&#x00026;p65) and Evi-1. Based on these findings, we propose G4 DNA could be one of the determinants of recombination wherein the single-stranded fold back structure could assist in strand separation and homologous pairing.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>We searched for PG4 DNA (with three to five guanine bases in stem and one to seven bases in loop (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004399-g001">Figure 1</xref>)) within 25618 hotspots (&#x0223c;303 Mb) and 9290 coldspots (&#x0223c;37 Mb) that were reported by Myers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Myers1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

This comprised of 32996 hotspots in 22 human chromosomes spanning 181 Mb of sequence. Our approach in this case allowed us to analyze corresponding regions of relatively low recombinogenic potential for each hotspot across all chromosomes. Out of 32996 sites 8984 regions (27.2&#x00025;) harbored one or more PG4 motifs; <italic>R</italic><sub>PG4/GC</sub> within the 8984 sites was about 2.4-fold higher than the corresponding flanking regions (<italic>R</italic><sub>PG4/GC</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.67 in hotspots versus 0.68 within flanking regions, p&#x0003c;1.15&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;299</sup>, z&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x02212;61.9, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test for two related samples).</p><p>In order to further confirm these findings, we selected hotspots and coldspots from the HapMap data using the recombinogenicity index cM/Mb (average of four different populations).

Keeping this in mind, we reasoned that DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) that generally constitute open chromatin may show further enrichment of PG4 DNA within hotspots relative to coldspots. The generalization about DHS being nucleosome-free is with the caveat that there are several examples where DHS are known to harbor nucleosomes that could constitute an alternative form of histone-DNA complex (reviewed in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Workman1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>). We used the experimentally determined DHS sites reported by Sabo <italic>et al.</italic> in human B lymphoblastoid cells using a tiling array based method, where 2690 DHS were mapped into 1&#x00025; of the human genome (ENCODE regions) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Sabo1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Out of these, 271 DHS (&#x0223c;72 kb) were found within 255 hotspots present in the ENCODE region while 33 DHS (&#x0223c;8 kb) mapped into the 99 coldspots present within the ENCODE regions. Therefore, as expected there was &#x0223c;3-fold more DHS within hotspots (271/255 in hotspots versus 33/99 in coldspots) largely supporting the view that recombinogenic regions have more open chromatin (exclude nucleosomes). In order to test density of PG4 DNA within DHS in hotspots versus coldspots we determined <italic>R</italic><sub>PG4/GC</sub> of the DHS found in respective regions. No PG4 DNA could be identified within the 33 DHS present in coldspots. The average <italic>R</italic><sub>PG4/GC</sub> within 271 DHS present in hotspots was 0.9723. Interestingly, &#x0003e;2-fold enrichment of PG4 density was observed in DHS relative to the overall average <italic>R</italic><sub>PG4/GC</sub> (0.401) observed within 25618 hotspots. We further noted that 74 sites (2.7&#x00025;) of the 2690 DHS harbored one or more PG4 DNA motifs. On considering the 271 DHS that were present within hotspots about 12 (4.4&#x00025;) had one or more PG4 DNA motifs; the average <italic>R</italic><sub>PG4/GC</sub> within these 12 DHS was 21.95 (&#x0003e;50-fold enrichment over the genome-wide hotspot average). Though substantial enrichment of PG4 density was observed within the DHS in hotspots (12/271) this was statistically not significant when compared to the absence of PG4 motifs in 33 DHS occurring within coldspots (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.37, Fisher's Exact test). Therefore, taken together this indicated enrichment of PG4 DNA within DHS present in hotspots and is in line with observations made earlier showing enriched PG4 DNA presence within DHS throughout the human genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Huppert2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the contribution of PG4 motifs in this context was not clearly discernible. One possible reason could be the relatively small number of DHS within hotspots/coldspots (present in the ENCODE regions) that were found to have PG4 motifs.</p><p>Meiotic crossovers events engage nucleoprotein assemblies known as synaptonemal complex for anchoring DNA strands at close proximity, wherein the presence of single stranded DNA has been postulated to result in G4 DNA formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Arthanari1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. This was supported by demonstrated effect of yeast meiosis-specific protein Hop1 in promoting synapses by binding to G4 DNA directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Muniyappa1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Anuradha1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. In line with involvement of G4 DNA in synapses, recent results show that several meiosis-specific proteins in the MRX complex (Mre11, Xrs2 and Rad50) that induces synapses formation, directly binds to G4 DNA. Interestingly, though all three factors in the MRX complex independently bind G4 DNA, the affinity for G4 DNA increases when all three are in complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Ghosal2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. These results, particularly the Hop1-G4 DNA interactions was known for decades and therefore implications of G4 DNA and its role in recombination has been proposed for a long time. To the best of our knowledge, we have tested this hypothesis for the first time in a genome-wide context and found strong support for the role of G4 DNA in recombination. This is indicated by the presence of genomic features that are consistent with the presence of structural G4 DNA forms, but are unlikely to be due to primary sequence representing a G4 DNA.</p><p>Keeping in mind the enrichment of PG4 DNA within hotspots, we conjectured that PG4 DNA could be functionally associated with other known sequences elements found to be associated with hotspots. To test this, we selected 7 <underline>s</underline>hort <underline>e</underline>nriched <underline>s</underline>equences (SES) (ranging from 6-mer to 9-mer, sequence is given in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>), which top the list of short sequences that were found to be enriched in 32996 hotspots with respect to control regions of low recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Myers1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The 7 SES selected by us were also found to be enriched within hotspots found in human imprinted chromosomal regions in a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Sandovici1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the SES, <named-content content-type="gene">CCTCCCT</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">CCACGTGG</named-content> have been noted to be enriched within meiotic recombination hotspots in another study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Myers2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. We arbitrarily selected a window of 50 bp flanking the PG4 DNA for testing co-occurrence with an SES. Co-occurrences within this window was found for all SES in 32996 hotspots and significance was analyzed based on randomly expected number of co-occurrences given the individual frequency of each SES and PG4 DNA within a hotspot (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> for details of the significance analysis, which was based on a method published earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Qiu1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>). This approach effectively rules out the possibility of observing higher co-occurrence in hotspots due to mere higher frequency of PG4 DNA/marker sequence because expected co-occurrence is calculated based on frequency of individual components in hotspot for each region. More than 100 co-occurrences were observed for three SES and are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004399-t001">Table 1</xref> along with chi-square values obtained for significance. Co-occurrence observed with other SES were lower than 100 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004399.s003">Table S2</xref>). Number of co-occurrence for <named-content content-type="gene">TACTGTTC</named-content> was only 15; this appears to be consistent with a previous study, which also found <named-content content-type="gene">TACTGTTC</named-content> does not show enriched presence within hotspots occurring in human imprinted chromosomal regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Sandovici1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Highest number of associations was observed for <named-content content-type="gene">GGGGGT</named-content> (4221), however, we noticed that this SES closely resembled a PG4 DNA sequence and hence was most likely to adopt a PG4 DNA structure with appropriate flanking sequence. Therefore, in order to check the validity these results, control analyses were done using the two sequences restricted for PG4 DNA formation. Number of co-occurrence of the control-PG4 DNA and (GX)<sub>17</sub>-control with each of the three SES (having more than 100 co-occurrences) is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004399-t001">Table 1</xref>. For <named-content content-type="gene">GGGGGT</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">CCTCCCT</named-content>, chi-square obtained for the control motifs were at least an order lower than that observed for PG4 DNA. Chi-square for <named-content content-type="gene">CCTCCCTG</named-content> with control-PG4 DNA was also 4-fold lower than that observed for PG4 DNA. Though low, the chi-square observed for these motifs with control sequences was not insignificant. A possible reason for this could be the G-rich nature of the control sequences which renders their co-occurrence with G/C-rich SES within regions with high overall GC-content significant. <named-content content-type="gene">CCTCCCT</named-content>, which is present within the long terminal repeats of retrovirus-like retrotransposon THE1B (overrepresented within hotspots) showed the strongest signal for enrichment within hotspots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Myers1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, PG4 DNA co-occurrence with SES is independently significant in at least three cases but must be considered with the caveat that some of these co-occurrences appear significant in controls also and therefore may or may not be associated directly to structure. Nevertheless, these observations build a case for testing association of SES with PG4 motifs experimentally.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0004399-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004399.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>PG4 DNA association with short enriched sequences (SES)</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0004399-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0004399.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0004399-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">short enriched sequences (SES)</td><td colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">Observed number of co-occurrence</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">Significance (Chi-square<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">&#x00024;</xref> of co-occurrence) is in parentheses</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PG4 DNA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control-PG4 DNA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(GX)17-control</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold><named-content content-type="gene">GGGGGT</named-content></bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4221</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(7638524)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(12956)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(27452)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold><named-content content-type="gene">CCTCCCT</named-content></bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">237</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(51342)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(3993)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(4021)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold><named-content content-type="gene">CCTCCCTG</named-content></bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">139</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(37604)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(8576)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(1342)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label>&#x00024;</label><p>Significance analysis in each case was done based on randomly expected co-occurrence (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Putative &#x003b1; hotspots in the human genome have been recently proposed, which exclusively depend on transcription factors for their activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Zhang1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

In order to test this, we analyzed presence of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) within 50 bases of all PG4 DNA observed in 32996 hotspots. This was done for all TFBS present in TRANSFAC using the P-Match program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Chekmenev1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>).

This suggests that only a fraction of the recombination events could be explained by TFBS association, which implicates alpha-hotspot activity in human. In the alpha-hotspot model, transcription factors associate with the recombination machinery to initiate/induce recombination. Though there is demonstrated evidence for alpha-hotspot activity in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Petes1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, only putative &#x003b1; hotspots have been characterized in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Zhang1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Perhaps interestingly, genome-wide estimate of number of hotspots (about 25000 to 50000) is somewhat close to the estimated number of genes in human, and is largely suggestive of alpha-hotspot activity in human, as noted in an earlier study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Myers1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, in the same study it was observed that hotspots are enriched outside transcribed domains (peaking at a distance of &#x0223c;30 kb from genes in either direction). This precludes the presence of large number of transcription factors within hotspots and is consistent with our observation indicating relatively few instances of PG4 DNA-TFBS occurrences. Keeping in mind the fact that though few, these co-occurrences are not insignificant, it is tempting to speculate that such co-occurrences may account for some of the recombination activity. However, it must be considered with the caveat that our understanding of &#x02018;transcribed region&#x02019; changes following more detailed analyses made possible by technological advances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Gerstein1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. In this context, it is also important to note that evolutionary selection may have resulted in a skewed estimate of recombination and therefore these results are based on analysis of realized recombination regions rather than actual recombination.</p><p>Interestingly, NF-kappa B has been found to associate with a meiotic recombination hotspot present in the second intron of the mouse E&#x003b2; gene, where NF-kappa B's role in recombination has been implicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Shenkar1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.

These findings support our observations showing significant NF-kappa B-PG4 DNA co-occurrence within hotspots. Though our findings for the first time directly indicate the possibility of association of any human factor to PG4 DNA in the context of recombination, it is not unusual. Several meiosis-specific proteins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have been demonstrated to bind G4 DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Muniyappa1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Ghosal1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Anuradha1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent findings strongly implicate non-B DNA conformations (such as triplexes, cruciform's, slipped structures, left-handed Z-DNA and G4 DNA) in initiation of chromosomal double strand breaks (DSB) leading to recombination-repair events and genomic rearrangements in general, causing several human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Wells1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Bacolla2">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> that resulted from gross deletions, inversions, duplications, translocations and also polymorphisms that were related to the structural motif and not sequence <italic>per se</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Wells1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>).

Thus other than G4 DNA, non-B DNA conformations in general, and more importantly role of the structural form in such processes have gained support from recent findings.</p><p>In summary, we looked at the existence and relative enrichment of PG4 DNA within hotspots with the reasoning that any distinct role in recombination will show significantly different presence of PG4 DNA in hotspots with respect to coldspots in a genome-wide context. Our findings show enrichment of PG4 DNA within hotspots. Significant association with transcription factors, c-Rel, NF-kappa B subunits and Evi-1 noted by us is also interesting in the context of transcription factor-mediated recombination events. Based on these and other findings reported herein we predict a functional role of G4 DNA, either directly or indirectly, on interaction with other <italic>trans</italic>-factors, in recombination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>PG4 DNA searching, mapping and analysis within hotspots and flanking regions</title><p>PG4 DNA sequences were identified using scripts written in Perl.

This had the following sequence pattern: N<sub>25</sub>&#x02212;G<sub>3</sub>&#x02212;<underline>N<sub>1&#x02013;7</sub></underline>&#x02212;G<sub>3</sub>&#x02212;<underline>N<sub>1&#x02013;7</sub></underline>&#x02212;G<sub>3</sub>&#x02212;N<sub>25</sub> with the following two restrictions: (i) two contiguous G's were not allowed at the 25 mer ends and (ii) two loops (underlined) were allowed to have all nucleotides but no two contiguous G's. Though the sequence pattern for G4 motif analyzed herein is most studied, few other sequence patterns can also result in G4 motifs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Patel1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-McManus1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>). Furthermore, recent reports suggest single G bases can also contribute to the tetrad assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Phan1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering these, we used a second control motif, the (GX)<sub>17</sub>-control (where X&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;A/T/C but not G). This 34-mer control was of G-content and length such that it represents a PG4 DNA in sequence pattern but complete disruption of the G-tetrad arrangement renders it a highly unlikely candidate for G4 structure formation. We also noted in an earlier study Vorlickova and coworkers have shown that GC-repeats are reluctant to adopt tetraplex forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Fojtik1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. GA and GT repeats the other possibilities offered by the (GX)<sub>17</sub>-control are highly unlikely to adopt the G4 structure.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Hotspots sequence retrieval and PG4 DNA analysis</title><p>We analyzed 25618 autosomal recombination hotspots from the 26177 regions reported by Myers <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004399-Myers1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> (out of 26177 hotspots, 520 regions on X-chromosome were excluded and entire sequence information for 39 regions could not be retrieved from Build 35). Out of 9299 autosomal coldspots reported (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/Recombination.html">http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/Recombination.html</ext-link>), 9290 coldspots could be retrieved and corresponding 9290 hotspots (matched for length and SNP density) were taken for analysis. Additionally, data on 32996 hotspots was obtained from the HapMap website for build 35 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hapmap.org/downloads/recombination/2006-10_rel21_phaseIII/">http://hapmap.org/downloads/recombination/2006-10_rel21_phaseIII/</ext-link>). All coordinates were NCBI Human Genome build Version 35 and analysis was done primarily for the &#x0002b; strand. The &#x02212; strand was analyzed for matched hotspots and coldspots. To analyze sequence flanking 32996 hotspots we obtained equal amount of region (for a given hotspot) both on the telomeric and centromeric sides of the hotspot. This would effectively give twice the length of the hotspot, therefore for comparison PG4 DNA density of the flanking regions was averaged. Regions of differing recombination potential were segregated from the HapMap data based on recombinogenicity unit cM/Mb for further analysis and designated as hotspots (&#x02265;10 cM/Mb) or coldspots (&#x02264;0.1 cM/Mb). These sequences were then used for analyzing the PG4 DNA content using in-house software. PG4 DNA density was expressed as number of nucleotides that would adopt structure divided by total sequence length of a given region. <italic>R</italic><sub>PG4/GC</sub> or PG4 DNA density normalized for GC content was obtained by dividing the PG4 DNA density by GC content of a given region; GC content was calculated using in-house software. GC&#x00025; of each spot was determined and averaged across all hotspots or all coldspots. Average GC content (42.63&#x00025;) in 25618 hotspots was higher than in 9290 coldspots (40.30&#x00025;; p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0007). Average GC&#x00025; in case of the matched 9290 hotspots was 41.55&#x00025; (versus 40.30&#x00025; for the coldspots, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.02). <italic>R</italic><sub>PG4/GC</sub> was calculated for each designated region independently and compared to check relative enrichment.
