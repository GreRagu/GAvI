Cinacalcet led to a reduction in glandular volume during the course of the study: 68% in glands with a baseline volume &#x0003c;500 mm<sup>3</sup> and 54% in glands with a baseline volume &#x02265;500 mm<sup>3</sup>.

Phosphorus retention and reduced synthesis of 1&#x02013;25 vitamin D result in low serum calcium levels, which causes a feedback secretion of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). Long-term hyperstimulation of parathyroids enhances cell proliferation resulting first in diffuse polyclonal hyperplasia and finally in monoclonal nodular hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2 R3">1&#x02013;3</xref>]. Since nodular hyperplasia does not involve all parathyroid glands, or all patients with CKD, to the same degree, it is logical to suppose that genetic mechanisms are involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4 R5 R6 R7">4&#x02013;7</xref>].</p><p>Glandular volume is a key marker for the severity of sHPT and increased secretion of iPTH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. However, only indirect measurements of parathyroid volumes are possible due to their location, small size and the difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements of glandular volume with common non-invasive techniques. In healthy patients, the identification of parathyroid glands is particularly difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. In sHPT, hyperplastic glands become distinguishable from the thyroid parenchyma due to their increased cellularity. High-resolution colour Doppler (CD) sonography is the only tomographic technique able to measure accurately volumetric variations in parathyroid glands. There is no defined size limit over which a parathyroid gland can be considered pathological, although a hypoechoic gland with two diameters &#x0003e;5 mm is generally considered to be hyperplastic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. In addition, CD sonography simultaneously provides semi-quantitative measurements of glandular perfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11 R12 R13">11&#x02013;13</xref>].</p><p>Patients are considered to have severe sHPT when serum phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), the Ca&#x02013;P product (Ca &#x000d7; P) and iPTH levels can no longer be adequately controlled by conventional therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>], and when clinical symptoms are associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14 R15">14,15</xref>]. Following international guidelines, parathyroidectomy (PTX) becomes mandatory when one or more parathyroid glands are enlarged (volume &#x0003e;500 mm<sup>3</sup>), iPTH values are &#x0003e;700 pg/ml and the response to conventional therapy is poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16 R17 R18 R19">16&#x02013;19</xref>].</p><p>The introduction of the calcimimetic cinacalcet (Mimpara&#x000ae;/Sensipar&#x000ae;) into clinical practice has led to its use in patients with various degrees of severity of sHPT, including those who are not candidates for PTX. Cinacalcet is an allosteric modulator of the calcium receptor (CaR). It increases the sensitivity of the CaR to activation by extracellular calcium and thus suppresses PTH release, while simultaneously lowering levels of serum P and Ca, and Ca&#x000a0;&#x000d7; P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20 R21 R22 R23">20&#x02013;23</xref>]. However, no studies to date have been published evaluating morphological variations in the parathyroid glands of maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) patients treated with cinacalcet.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet on the morphology (volume, structure and vascular pattern) of parathyroid glands in MHD patients with severe sHPT, in relation to biochemical parameters and the duration of therapy, using high-resolution CD sonography.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>Nine consecutive MHD patients awaiting PTX at our nephrology and dialysis unit (6 males, 3 females; mean age &#x000b1; SD, 56 &#x000b1; 13 years) were recruited and prospectively studied. All patients had severe sHPT, and none, due to age, or cardiovascular or general conditions, was an ideal candidate for PTX. In our centre, patients undergo subtotal PTX when one or more glands have a volume &#x0003e;500 mm<sup>3</sup> by CD sonography and iPTH values are &#x0003e;700 pg/ml, to avoid the risk of nodular degeneration of the remnant glands. During the period of the study, one additional young patient awaiting transplantation stopped treatment with cinacalcet after 1 month due to drug intolerance (epigastralgia). She was excluded from the study and underwent PTX.</p><p>As comparison, we have considered a historical control group that included 11 consecutive patients with clinical, biochemical and morphological signs of severe and refractory sHPT treated with conventional PTX between 2003 and 2006.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>The treatment protocol integrated cinacalcet with patients&#x02019; existing pharmacological sHPT therapies (calcium supplements, phosphate binders or vitamin D sterols). Treatment with cinacalcet did not require a pharmacological wash-out period. The starting dose of cinacalcet was 30 mg/day. This was increased by 30 mg every 21&#x02013;30 days, until the patient reached the targets indicated in the KDOQI&#x02122; guidelines. The maximum dose of cinacalcet administered was 150&#x000a0;mg/day. As cinacalcet treatment was used for compassionate use before commercialization in Italy, all patients signed an informed consent form.</p><p>Conventional therapy was adjusted during follow-up according to the OPTIMA algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. When indicated, the dose of a vitamin D sterol was reduced by &#x0223c;50% in sequential steps until a minimum administered dose was reached: intravenous calcitriol, 0.5 &#x003bc;g three times per week; intravenous alfacalcidol, 1 &#x003bc;g three times per week; intravenous paricalcitol, 2 &#x003bc;g three times per week; oral calcitriol, 0.25 &#x003bc;g three times per week; oral alfacalcidol, 0.25 &#x003bc;g/day. The dose of cinacalcet was reduced if a patient was not receiving vitamin D. Phosphate binder dosages were modulated depending on serum Ca and P levels in an attempt to maintain Ca &#x000d7; P within the international guidelines range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>].</p><p>Biochemical parameters [P, Ca, Ca &#x000d7; P, iPTH and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] and the morphology and vascular pattern of the parathyroid glands were measured at baseline and every 6 months thereafter, for a follow-up period of 24&#x02013;30 months. Changes in cinacalcet dosing and the onset of any side effects were recorded throughout this period. iPTH was measured using the Nichols IRMA method.</p><p>To prove the effect of cinacalcet on the functional behaviour of parathyroid glands, an additional experiment was performed to see whether or not serum iPTH increased immediately after an interruption of cinacalcet. In the absence of any change in other treatments, the drug was stopped for 2 weeks in three patients who had experienced the highest reductions in iPTH and gland volume and in two patients who had experienced the highest reduction in iPTH, but only mild reductions in gland volume and vascularization. iPTH was measured twice, under exactly the same conditions (i.e. at morning, before the dialysis, at the start and at the end of the test and finally 2 weeks after restarting the therapy).</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Imaging techniques</title><p>High-resolution CD sonography was carried out in our unit by an expert nephrologist using digital equipment (Logiq&#x000a0;9<sup>TM</sup>, General Electric Medical Systems, USA) and a small parts linear array (matrix 1.5D). Transmission frequency (9&#x02013;14 MHz) provided an axial and a lateral resolution of 0.2 mm. Images were acquired using harmonic imaging and spatial compounding to reduce speckle.</p><p>Patients were examined with the neck hyperextended in a supine decubitus. The anatomical location of the parathyroid glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23 R24 R25">23&#x02013;25</xref>] was determined by a sequence of transverse, longitudinal and oblique scans in the laterocervical region from the corner of the jaw to the superior mediastinum. The mediocervical transverse scan was essential to identify the thyroid lobes and isthmus. The same transverse scan along the laterocervical line was used to identify the usual landmarks (sternocleidomastoid muscle, pre-thyroid muscles, epiaortic vessels, oesophagus, pre-vertebral muscles). Longitudinal and oblique scans were used to define the anatomical relationships with the homolateral thyroid lobe, the oesophagus, the long muscles of the neck, the laterocervical vessels and the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. Additional oblique scans were carried out on the jugular fossa to identify the inferior parathyroid glands, sometimes located in the superior mediastinum or in the horn of the thymus. The inferior thyroid artery in the mid-cervical tract was also located to define vascularization of parathyroid glands.</p><p>Normal parathyroid glands are rich in adipose cells so they are indistinguishable from the thyroid parenchyma even using high-resolution probes. Glandular hyperplasia changes the ultrasound pattern: the gland becomes diffusely hypoechoic and is outlined from the thyroid parenchyma by a thin hyperechoic edge. Using the ellipsoid formula (4/3&#x000a0;&#x003c0;&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 1/2 anteroposterior diameter &#x000d7; 1/2 latero-lateral diameter &#x000d7; 1/2 craniocaudal diameter), it is possible to calculate the gland volume in mm<sup>3</sup>. Glands with nodular hyperplasia appear as hypoechoic nodules that are well outlined from the thyroid lobes in common locations. Glands with at least two diameters &#x0003e;5 mm and a volume &#x0003c;500&#x000a0;mm<sup>3</sup> are considered definitively to be pathological (diffuse or polyclonal hyperplasia), whereas glands with a diameter &#x0003e;1 cm and overall volume &#x02265;500 mm<sup>3</sup> are considered to have monoclonal nodular degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16 R17">16,17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Parameters used to evaluate morphological changes in the glands were (1) gland diameter and volume; (2) presence of anechoic areas (suggesting cystic degeneration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>] and absence of vascularized areas; (3) echogenicity.</p><p>B-Mode sonography was combined with CD sampling. Nodular flow was characterized using a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) &#x0003c;800 kHz, CD frequency 3.8 MHz and mid-high colour gain (set to 45&#x02013;50, with a range of 0&#x02013;60), and a steering angle of 30&#x000b0;. Vascular pattern is a semi-quantitative parameter, dependent on both the settings of the sonolayer and subjective evaluation by the operator. Three different vascularization patterns were identified: type 1, glands with no Doppler signal; type 2, hypovascularized glands with a poor or weak Doppler signal, represented by occasional colour spots in the hilar/endonodular region; type 3, hypervascularized glands having an enlarged feeding artery at the hilum, a peripheral arc of vascularity and/or ray-like endonodular vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27 R28 R29">27&#x02013;29</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All sonographic examinations were recorded and reviewed by two other skilled operators who used the same parameters. An intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess inter-observer reliability. Intra-observer ICC was 0.95 whereas inter-observer ICC was 0.91 for measurements of glandular volume.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Longitudinal scan of right lobe of thyroid.

Long-term studies have given similar results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. An experimental study showed that stabilization of mineral metabolism parameters was accompanied by a decrease in parathyroid hyperplasia in uraemic rat models treated with cinacalcet, with no evidence of increased apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. To date, there has been a lack of experimental models or studies focused on the effect of cinacalcet on nodular hyperplasia. Furthermore, no data have been published regarding the effect of cinacalcet on potential morphological variations in hyperplastic parathyroid glands in CKD patients with severe sHPT. Clinical evaluation of sHPT is usually carried out by the assessment of biochemical parameters rather than via morphological measurements. The aim of this observational study was to investigate the effects of long-term therapy with cinacalcet, in association with conventional therapy, on the morphology of hyperplastic parathyroid glands.</p><p>We show here that cinacalcet had a more rapid effect on the biochemical profile of sHPT than on the morphology of parathyroid glands. Changes in volume, vascularization and sonographic pattern were observed after 12&#x02013;18 months of therapy. After this time, we observed a progressive change in the structural pattern of hyperplastic glands. Glands with a baseline volume &#x02265;500 mm<sup>3</sup> had a tendency to show involutive phenomena, such as anechoic areas of cystic degeneration. This was associated with a decrease in glandular volume in all but one case, where gland size increased. In glands with a baseline volume &#x0003c;500 mm<sup>3</sup>, there were more significant changes in volume. There was a tendency for the structural pattern of these glands to change from hypoechoic (suggesting that they were hyperplastic with a rich cellularity) to hyperechoic (suggesting that they were quiescent with an increased number of adipose cells). In the most significant cases, glands became very small and, like normal parathyroid glands, were indistinguishable from the thyroid parenchyma.</p><p>We have noted a relationship between major involutive phenomena and a major reduction in iPTH and Ca serum levels, suggesting that a lower dose of cinacalcet may have been used. Interestingly, independent of baseline volume, glands that became hypovascularized following cinacalcet treatment inversely reproduced the progression of the parathyroid gland to hyperplasia (i.e. from a hypovascularized to a hypervascularized pattern).</p><p>Critical analysis of these data suggests that stabilization of the biochemical profile of sHPT, as well as the involutive phenomena in the glands, was observed only after the introduction of cinacalcet in the therapeutical schema. These observations suggest that cinacalcet is able to modulate the biological response of parathyroid cells in synergy with vitamin D and phosphate binders. So, the degenerative effects that are observed during long-term treatment have to be considered as a result of a combined pharmacological effect.</p><p>Cystic degeneration and hypovascularization were evident in glands with diffuse and nodular hyperplasia. Physiopathological mechanisms responsible for glandular degeneration are unknown and should be the objective of further studies. At the moment, findings do not support or exclude the possibility that glandular degeneration is due to enhanced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] as well as to an indirect effect of cinacalcet on the vessel tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Nevertheless, it should be noted that a recent study has reported a pro-apoptotic effect of cinacalcet in glands with nodular hyperplasia excised in patients not previously treated with phosphate binders or vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>].</p><p>To determine whether cinacalcet could be considered the trigger of the functional response of hyperplastic glands, cinacalcet therapy was interrupted temporarily in a small number of patients. After 2 weeks of suspension, serum iPTH levels increased in all patients, even in those who had the major involutive phenomena. Interestingly, the increase in serum iPTH values was smaller as compared with initial PTH levels (mean values close to 1200 pg/ml). One explanation might be that PTH secretion was lower after long-term cinacalcet therapy due to a reduction in the number of functional parathyroid cells (mass reduction). These data, although not definitive, are interesting: they demonstrate the efficacy of the drug on biochemical and functional profiles, but they are contradictory because they do not demonstrate a clear association between involutive phenomena and a reduction in function of the glands. Possible explanations for this could be linked to the persistence of glandular cellular masses that are no longer inhibited after the suspension of the drug or to the possibility that the apparent cellular necrosis is not sufficiently complete to withstand interruption of the drug. Furthermore, the response seen in iPTH after discontinuation and reintroduction of cinacalcet suggests that the remnant parathyroid tissue responded to stimulation of the CaR. These findings confirm the evidence from pre-clinical studies that show that calcimimetics inhibit parathyroid hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] in subtotally nephrectomized rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. However, it should be noted that cellular cultures <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>] and the post-5/6 nephrectomy rat model of secondary HPT are not a true reflection of the progression of nodular hyperplasia in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>].</p><p>The main limitations of this study were the small number of patients and that data for the control patients were collected retrospectively. In addition, some analyses were based on the number of glands, but the changes in gland volume within a patient are unlikely to be independent, and this has not been accounted for in the statistical analyses.</p><p>In summary, the practical consequences of these preliminary data are the need for a combination of cinacalcet with conventional therapy and also the monitoring of the glandular response with morphological parameters. Finally, the reductions in glandular volume and vascularization, particularly in smaller glands, provide a strong argument for the early use of cinacalcet (and at lower doses) in combination with standard therapy. Early &#x02018;pharmacological PTX&#x02019;, using cinacalcet in combination with conventional therapy, could reduce the number of patients who eventually require a surgical PTX.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Amgen Europe for providing funding for editing support.</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
