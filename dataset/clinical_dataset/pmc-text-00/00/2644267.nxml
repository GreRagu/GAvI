Male SD rats were given repeated injections of saline or cocaine hydrochloride (15 mg/kg, i.p. for 10 consecutive days) followed by one challenge injection on the 4th day after the last daily injection. Cocaine challenge (15 mg/kg, i.p) produced a larger increase in locomotor activity and expression of TH in the central dopaminergic areas. Pretreatment with CR (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) and BER (200 mg/kg, p.o.) 30 min before the daily injections of cocaine significantly inhibited the cocaine-induced locomotor activity as well as TH expression in the central dopaminergic areas. Our data demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of CR and BER on the repeated cocaine-induced locomotor activity were closely associated with the reduction of dopamine biosynthesis and post-synaptic neuronal activity. These results suggest that CR and BER may be effective for inhibiting the behavioral effects of cocaine by possibly modulating the central dopaminergic system.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cocaine</kwd><kwd>berberine</kwd><kwd><italic>Coptidis rhizome</italic></kwd><kwd>locomotor activity</kwd><kwd>tyrosine hydroxylase</kwd><kwd>ventral tegmental area.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Repeated exposure to psychostimulants induces sensitization to their behavioral stimulant effects. Behavioral sensitization is the enhanced motor-stimulant response that occurs with repeated exposure to such psychostimulants as cocaine or amphetamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Cocaine is a potent and widely abused psychostimulant that exerts behavioral and neuropharmacologic effects; these effects may be mediated by the central dopaminergic systems. Especially, the mesolimbic system from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), one of the main central dopaminergic systems, has been implicated in the processes of drug addiction and this includes behavioral sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). For example, many studies reveal that the reinforcing effects of cocaine are related to the blockade of the dopamine (DA) reuptake systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and the consequent increases in binding of DA to its post-synaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The inhibition of DA re-uptake has been demonstrated in several brain nuclei such as the NAc, the striatum, the VTA and the medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>). DA receptor antagonists also block the cocaine-induced increases of locomotor activity and stereotypy, the decrease of food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and they block the cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In addition, several studies have shown that repeated exposure to cocaine produced the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) enzyme activity for DA biosynthesis in mesolimbic DA pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p><italic>Coptidis rhizoma</italic> (<italic>Coptis chinensis FRANCH</italic>, CR) has been widely used as a Korean traditional medicine for hundreds of years. CR exerts therapeutic effects on disorders such as anxiety, depression and substance abuse in human and animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and CR and its main compound, berberine (BER) produced a variety of biological effects on the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19 B20">17&#x02013;20</xref>). In particular, protoberberine alkaloids such as BER, palmatine and coptisine inhibited DA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). BER reduces the dopamine content in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>However, the effects of CR or BER on cocaine-induced neurochemical and behavioral alterations have not been investigated. Therefore, in the present study, we determined to examine whether CR or BER could affect the repeated cocaine-induced locomotor activity. The expressions of TH in the VTA were also examined by using immunohistochemical methods in order to determine a possible mechanism underlining the suppressive effects of CR and BER on cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization in rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subject</title><p>Male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats weighing 260&#x02013;270 g each were obtained from Samtaco Animal Corp.

Seoul, Korea). The voucher specimens (no. KH-CR01) are deposited at the herbarium located in the College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University. CR (100 g) was cut into small pieces and extracted three times in a reflux condenser for 24 h each time using 85% methanol. The solutions were combined, filtered through Whatman no. 1 filter paper and concentrated using a rotary vacuum evaporator, this was followed by lyophilization. The yield was 12.8% (w/w). CR consists of the major active component, berberine (4&#x02013;7%) and also of small amount of columbamine, coptisine, groenlandicine, berberastine and thalifendine. Cocaine hydrochloride (Macharlan, Smiss Limit, UK) and berberine (Sigma, St Louis MO, USA) were obtained from the standard commercial suppliers. Cocaine hydrochloride was dissolved in 0.9% saline and CR and berberine were dissolved in distilled water.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental Design</title><p>The experiment consisted of three phases: a 10 day developmental phase, a 3 day withdrawal phase and a 1 day challenging phase. The experiment was designed to investigate the effect of CR and BER on the behavioral sensitization produced by repeated injection of cocaine. The rats were divided into eight groups. The two groups were pre-treated with saline [0.9% NaCl, i.p. saline-treated rats (SAL) group; <italic>n</italic> = 4] or cocaine [15 mg/kg, i.p. cocaine-induced rats (COC) group; <italic>n</italic> = 7] one daily for 10 consecutive days, after which time the rats were challenged with the same dose of saline or cocaine, 72 h after the last treatment, respectively. The acute cocaine treated group (15 mg/kg, i.p. CON group; <italic>n</italic> = 5) received saline for 10 days, after which time the rats were challenged with cocaine, 72 h after the last treatment. The other experimental groups were pre-treated with CR 50 mg/kg (CR50 + COC group, p.o. <italic>n</italic> = 5), CR 100 mg/kg (CR100 + COC group, p.o. <italic>n</italic> = 4), CR 200 mg/kg (CR200 + COC group, p.o. <italic>n</italic> = 8), CR 400 mg/kg (CR400 + COC group, p.o. <italic>n</italic> = 5) and berberine 200 mg/kg (BER200 + COC group, p.o. <italic>n</italic> = 5), respectively, 30 min before the injections of cocaine during a 10 day development phase. We did a pilot dose&#x02013;response experiment with using BER 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg and we found that BER 200 mg/kg produced a maximal effect. Also, the dosage (200 mg/kg) chosen in this study is a relatively standard one that other workers have reported on in a previous animal study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Their locomotor activity was measured for 1 h after every injection of cocaine or saline.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Locomotor Activity</title><p>The rats were individually housed prior to behavioral testing.

The walls and floor were made of clear plastic and they were painted black. Locomotor activity was monitored by a videotracking system using the S-MART program (PanLab, Barcelona, Spain). Rats were allowed to adapt themselves for 1 h in the container and the distance they traveled was recorded every 10 min during a 1 h baseline and during a 1 h after treatment.

The brains were removed, post-fixed overnight, cryoprotected in 20% sucrose, and cut by a cryostat as 30 &#x003bc;m coronal sections. The sections were obtained according to the rat atlas of Paxinos and Watson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and stored in PBS solution for immunocytochemical processing. Sections were immunostained for TH protein by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method.

The sections were washed for 5 min in PBST and then incubated for 120 min in PBST containing biotinylated goat anti-sheep IgG antibody at a 1: 200 dilution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Following a 90 min incubation in the Elite standard vecta stain avidin&#x02013;biotin complex (ABC) re-agent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), the sections were again washed three times for 5 min each time in PBS, then incubated in a medium containing 0.05% 3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB: Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) with 0.01% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 min to reveal the immunoreactivity.

The results of present study demonstrated that repeated daily injections of cocaine produced a higher increase in locomotor activity to a subsequent systemic challenge with cocaine. Current results also clearly showed that a pre-treatment with CR and BER significantly suppressed the chronic cocaine-induced sensitization of locomotor activity and reduced the chronic cocaine-induced increases of TH expression in the VTA in the central DA pathways. These findings suggest that a pre-treatment with CR and BER reduces the development of locomotor activity in response to cocaine by modulating dopamine synthesis in the VTA. It is well known that the mesolimbic system from the VTA to the NAc mediates the behavioral and reinforcing effects of cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In the present study, repeated injections of cocaine produced increases in locomotor activity and increases in the TH-like immunoreactivity in the central DA systems. These results agree with the other previous evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>The cocaine-treated group showed a significant increase in locomotor activity, when compared with the saline-treated group. However, there was no significant difference in locomotor activity between the CR and berberine only-treated groups. The CR or BER injections did not produce any significant changes in locomotor activity, indicating that CR or BER did not produce any significant increase in behavioral activity. Meanwhile, the CR and BER administered 30 min prior to the cocaine injection inhibited chronic cocaine-induced sensitization of locomotor activity when compared with the chronic cocaine-treated group. These results suggest that CR and BER inhibit the chronic cocaine-induced psychologic dependence, as determined by the behavioral sensitization paradigm.</p><p>Current results demonstrated that pre-treatment of CR 200 mg/kg and CR 400 mg/kg produced a significantly higher inhibitory effect on activity than BER 200 mg/kg. Since it is known that CR contains plamatine and coptisine as well as BER and previous reports have shown that palamatine and cotisine reduced behavioral activity and DA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), perhaps other alkaloids may affect cocaine-induced neuronal and behavioral alterations. Future analyses are needed to investigate neurochemical and behavioral effects of these components on cocaine-induced sensitization.</p><p>We found that a pre-treatment of CR and BER significantly inhibited development of the cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization and tegmental TH to subsequent cocaine challenge. The present results also suggest that pre-treatment of CR and BER inhibition of the repeated cocaine-induced hyperactivity is closely related with the inhibition of the activated dopaminergic systems that is produced by cocaine. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of CR and BER on behavioral activity reflects the blockade of dopaminergic biosynthesis or transmission. This suggestion is strongly strengthened by previous studies showing that treatment of BER suppressed DA biosynthesis in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>Even though several studies have indicated that protoberberberins may have pharmacologic effects on the central DA system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), this is the first demonstration of BER action on cocaine-induced behavioral and neurochemical activity. Little is currently known about the action of BER on the central DA system at cellular or molecular levels. Other kinds of protoberberines, the tetrahydroprotoberberines (THPBs), were previously shown to display the highest affinity for the D1- and D2-like receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33 B34 B35 B36">33&#x02013;36</xref>). Our preliminary data suggest that BER may bind to DA-receptor sites (unpublished observations). In addition to the clinical study of CR or BER on cocaine addiction, further pharmacologic actions of BER on the central dopaminergic systems should be investigated in the future.</p><p>Taken together, CR has been empirically prescribed as a traditional medicine for the treatment of substance abuse, but its major therapeutic actions have not been well known. However, our results demonstrated that CR and BER have central effects and thus contribute to the restoration of a normal biochemical balance in the dopaminergic system. Therefore, our results might provide a mechanistic rationale for herbal treatments including CR for treatment of drug abuse.</p><p>In summary, the present results demonstrated that CR and BER inhibit chronic cocaine-induced sensitization and they may modulate the cocaine-induced DA transmission at both the pre- and post-synaptic levels. These results suggest that CR and BER may be effective for inhibiting the behavioral effects of cocaine by modulating the central dopaminergic system.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by a grant of the SRC program of KOSEF (R11-2005-014) and the Korea Research Foundation
