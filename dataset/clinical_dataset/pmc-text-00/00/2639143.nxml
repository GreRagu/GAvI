Prolonged contraction duration showed better specificity and sensitivity than QTc as a marker of cardiac events and therefore provided added value in risk assessment in LQTS mutation carriers. The contraction duration showed greater heterogeneity in LQTS mutation carriers than in controls, reflecting dispersion of myocardial contraction, presumably caused by electrical dispersion of repolarization. LQTS mutation carriers showed a marked increase in PEV, indicating myocardial shortening after aortic valve closure. These findings were associated with a history of cardiac events.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Possible mechanisms</title><p>In the normal heart, several mechanisms regulate myocyte repolarization. As the QT interval on the surface ECG represents the summation of action potentials in ventricular myocytes, QT prolongation implies action potential prolongation in at least some portions of the ventricle. A prolongation of the action potential duration is associated with an increase in the tension developed by the ventricular muscle, leading to a prolonged contraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C8">8</xref></sup> In this study, the prolonged contraction in LQTS mutation carriers was assessed by TDI.</p><p>Action potential prolongation can lead to the development of early EADs, which are oscillations in the membrane potential before repolarization is complete. EADs may result in a second contraction and lead to ectopic beats if occurring in a substantial part of the myocardium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C15">15</xref></sup> Triggered upstrokes from EADs are a likely initiating mechanism for torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C18">18</xref></sup> The prolonged contraction duration and the augmented PEV in LQTS mutation carriers could represent the mechanical equivalent of an electrical EAD as proposed by De Ferrari <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C10">10</xref></sup> This is consistent with the finding that symptomatic LQTS mutation carriers had greater PEV than asymptomatic mutation carriers. EADs may be present at subthreshold levels in LQTS mutation carriers also in basal conditions, without leading to arrhythmias but causing contraction prolongation and PEV.</p><p>In the majority of our LQTS mutation carriers, we found the greatest magnitude of the PEV in basal and mid-LV septal regions. Previous reports have demonstrated that action potentials of the mid-myocardial cells (M-cells) prolong more than epicardial or endocardial in response to a lowering of heart rate or to action potential-prolonging agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C19">19</xref></sup> A prolonged action potential leads to a higher risk of EAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C15">15</xref></sup> M-cells have been identified in the interventricular septum and in the anterior and lateral walls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C20">20</xref></sup> The localization of the reported M-cells matched the regions of the greatest PEV in our LQTS patients. Therefore, we speculated that PEV and prolonged contraction assessed by TDI could be a result of the prolonged action potentials in these M-cells that are known to have the longest action potential duration.</p><p>A possible mechanism of arrhythmia in LQTS patients is increased dispersion of repolarization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C21">21</xref></sup> Dispersion of repolarization may be localized between two different ventricular regions and as a transmural phenomenon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C23">23</xref></sup> The measurement of QTc and QT dispersion as indicators of ventricular repolarization prolongation and dispersion have been widely used during the last two decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C24">24</xref></sup> However, identification of the end of the T-wave is difficult and measurements of dispersion by ECG have modest reproducibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C25">25</xref></sup> The TDI method has the ability to measure detailed time intervals in different regions of the LV. Our study clearly demonstrated that the dispersion of mechanical contraction can be assessed by TDI, as a regional difference in contraction duration throughout the LV. Furthermore, that mechanical dispersion was more pronounced in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic LQTS patients.</p><p>Double-mutation carriers, JLNS patients, represent the most severe clinical phenotype and were therefore analysed separately in this study. The presence of two mutations (JLNS) is associated with higher risk of cardiac events and more widespread current loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C26">26</xref></sup> In our study, these facts were supported by a more prolonged contraction duration in a greater number of cardiac segments in JLNS patients compared with single-mutation carriers. Standard deviation of contraction duration was therefore lower in the JLNS patients. Pronounced prolongation of contraction duration may indicate that EADs are the most likely mechanism for arrhythmia in JLNS patients.</p><p>The contraction duration in LQTS mutation carriers exceeded the time to aortic valve closure. This indicated myocardial contraction after aortic valve closure, which may be a result of an inhomogeneous end of contraction not sufficient to maintain the opening of the aortic valve. If the dispersion of contraction reflects the electrical dispersion of repolarization, a major arrhythmogenic factor present in LQTS mutation carriers can be shown by echocardiography.</p><p>A prolonged myocardial contraction will lead to inhomogeneous and delayed onset of the E&#x02032; wave. Furthermore, an inhomogeneous onset of diastolic lengthening will cause reduced E&#x02032; amplitude and prolonged duration of E&#x02032;. These assumptions were confirmed in our study that showed delayed onset of E&#x02032;, reduced amplitude of the E&#x02032;, and prolonged E deceleration time. These findings imply an impairment of diastolic function in a number of symptomatic LQTS mutation carriers.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Previous studies</title><p>Echocardiography has traditionally been used to exclude structural heart disease in LQTS patients. However, Nador <italic>et al</italic>. presented an echocardiographic study which showed specific ventricular wall abnormalities in 42 LQTS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C9">9</xref></sup> Using M-mode technique, they demonstrated the occurrence of a slow contraction in the late myocardial thickening phase. Further they demonstrated a dip in the later part of contraction followed by a second anterior movement of the endocardium producing a double-peak image. Interestingly, their findings were associated with a greater probability of syncope or cardiac arrest. These findings are confirmed in our study. We showed that prolonged contraction duration and increased PEV, which give a similar double-peak pattern, are associated with cardiac events. Another study has shown mechanical abnormality by M-mode technique in LQTS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C27">27</xref></sup> Their findings were attributed to mechanical dispersion possibly caused by electrical dispersion of repolarization. A recent case report indicated mechanical dysfunction in a patient with extreme QT prolongation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C28">28</xref></sup> A recent study showed myocardial velocity abnormalities in 10 LQTS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C29">29</xref></sup> Our study confirms these findings using a new modality of echocardiography. We believe that TDI measurements may be an easier and more objective way of quantifying abnormal regional motion than M-mode echocardiography. The study by Nador <italic>et al</italic>. was followed by a study giving calcium channel blockers to 10 LQTS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C10">10</xref></sup> Verapamil abolished the wall motion abnormality, suggesting that symptomatic LQTS patients may have an abnormal increase in the intracellular calcium concentration before relaxation has completed, possibly linked to an EAD, and that the contraction abnormality may be the mechanical equivalent of an EAD.</p><p>Post-systolic shortening after aortic valve closure, which is similar but not identical to PEV, has been demonstrated in ischaemic myocardium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C31">31</xref></sup> and may also occur in healthy individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C32">32</xref></sup> PEV in ischaemic heart disease is of greater magnitude compared with PEV in healthy individuals, and a coexisting reduction in ejection velocity is obligate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C32">32</xref></sup> PEV can even be negative if post-systolic shortening is missing in healthy individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C33">33</xref></sup> The LQTS mutation carriers had normal systolic ejection velocities and ejection fraction. Thus, the elevated PEV in LQTS mutation carriers was not considered to be a result of earlier cardiac arrests with concomitant myocardial ischaemia.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>QTc is the most rational parameter for screening patients with unexplained syncope or cardiac arrest. In known LQTS patients, risk stratification is based on the occurrence of previous syncope, genotype, gender, and QTc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C1">1</xref></sup> The recent development from family cascade genetic screening has brought us numerous LQTS mutation carriers with normal QTc, who would have been undiagnosed before the genetic era. These asymptomatic mutation carriers demonstrate neither clinical symptoms nor prolonged QTc. Nevertheless, they have increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. It is a clinical challenge to decide whether these asymptomatic mutation carriers should receive prophylactic treatment or not. Assessment of myocardial contraction duration may add important information in risk stratification in LQTS mutation carriers when QTc is normal or mildly prolonged. Our data showed that myocardial contraction duration had higher sensitivity and specificity for a history of cardiac events than QTc. Importantly, in all symptomatic mutations carriers that QTc failed to identify, contraction duration by echocardiography was prolonged (&#x02265;0.44 s).</p><p>Our study did not provide data that actually demonstrated that asymptomatic LQTS mutation carriers with prolonged contraction duration and elevated PEV were more likely to develop arrhythmias than those without. This requires a prospective study in which asymptomatic untreated patients are followed for an adequate period of time, which is difficult for ethical reasons. Nevertheless, we propose that TDI should become part of the routine clinical evaluation for LQTS mutation carriers. The myocardial contraction duration is relatively simple to obtain and has excellent reproducibility for inter and intra-observations.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Limitations</title><p>Prolonged contraction duration by strain in this study was highly significant as a risk parameter for cardiac events. However, the results assessed by myocardial velocities were significantly associated with cardiac events and therefore we preferred velocity to strain measurements since the reproducibility of this method is superior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN466C34">34</xref></sup> Circumferential and radial strains were not analysed in this study.</p><p>A limitation of TDI is marked angle dependency, which makes it sensitive to mal-alignment between the principal direction of myocardial shortening and the Doppler beam. Owing to less angle dependency, time interval assessment provided by TDI is a better reproducible parameter than measurements of velocity amplitudes.</p><p>The association between myocardial mechanical and electrical dispersion in LQTS mutation carriers should be studied in experimental studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed that TDI can be of important value in risk stratification of LQTS mutation carriers. Mechanical dispersion of myocardial contraction assessed by TDI was increased in LQTS patients. Prolonged myocardial contraction duration and augmented PEV were better related to cardiac events compared with QTc. Therefore, we propose that these novel parameters might be assessed in the management of LQTS patients.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by <grant-sponsor>Inger and John Fredriksen&#x02019;s Foundation and the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority.
