However, the treatment of cancer patients with DOX may be complicated by deleterious side effects. One of the most feared side effects of DOX is a direct damage to the heart which may lead to the development of acute and chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), malignant arrhythmias and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The acute form of cardiotoxicity may occur within a week of the treatment and is not dose-depended, indeed, it may occur after a single dose of the agent. On the other hand, the incidence of the chronic CHF at specific cumulative doses of doxorubicin include 0.4% at 400 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>of body surface area, 7% at 550 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 18% percent at 700 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Electrophysiologic abnormalities are frequent and are detected as ECG changes in 20&#x02013;30% of the patients in form of non-specific ST and T wave changes, T wave flattening, decreased QRS voltage and/or prolongation of the QT interval. Arrhythmias, including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardias are seen in 0.5&#x02013;3% of patients with overall incidence of 0.7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Many different cardioprotective agents have been tested for prevention of DOX toxicity experimentally and clinically but with limited success[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Considering the essential role of iron and the doxorubicin-iron complex, iron chelators have been developed against cardiotoxicity where dexrazoxane was found to be the most promising drug[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Myocardial damage is a consequence of direct DOX interference with important intracellular homeostatic processes primarily mediated by increased intracellular oxidative stress[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Intrinsic antioxidative systems in the cells are normally able to reduce the damage caused by oxidative stress. Compared to other organs, however, the heart has inherently lower potential to protect itself from the free radicals due to the limited number of anti-oxidative systems in the cardiomyocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is therefore hypothesized that treatment with antioxidants may play an important role in preventing myocardial damage. The mouse model of acute DOX toxicity is a simple and readily available small animal model particularly suitable for screening studies for different cardioprotective interventions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In the recent years, there has been an increased research interest to develop cardioprotective and other pharmacological therapies from natural sources like animals and plants of marine origin. A well known example of such a promising clinical application in the field of cardiovascular medicine are the fish-derived long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. There is evidence that also aqueous fish-derived substances, such as taurine, have cardioprotective effects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It has been speculated that these observations are caused by a radical scavenging mechanism[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We hypothesize that aqueous fish muscle extract may improve survival in mouse model of acute heart failure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>The Animal Ethics Committee of the University of G&#x000f6;teborg approved the animal experiments. Male BALB/c mice (B&#x00026;K Universal AB) weighing ~25 g were used in all experiments. Fresh whole cod (Gadus morhua) was obtained from Ler&#x000f6;y Allt i Fisk (G&#x000f6;teborg, Sweden).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of extract from cod muscle</title><p>The cod was manually filleted and the light muscle was separated from skin and dark muscle. The light muscle was minced, packed in 200 ml polypropylene centrifuge bottles (200 g in each) and centrifuged at 15 000*g for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant (press juice) was filtered through a filter paper (1010, Munktell's, Swedish Filter paper, Grycksbo pappersbruk AB, Sweden) and frozen immediately at -80&#x000b0;C. Using a stirred 400 ml Amicon ultra filtration cell (Model 52, Amicon Corporation, Danvers, MA, USA), 50 ml of thawed cod muscle press juice was filtered through a 500 Da ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA) at 50 psi and 4&#x000b0;C. The first 25 ml of filtrate were collected and the pH was adjusted to 7.2 with 1 M NaOH. The filtrates were then immediately frozen at -80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Animal model</title><p>To evaluate whether the cod extract may be delivered subcutaneously without provocation of an inflammatory response, three animals were treated with the extract delivered by subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps (Alzet, Durect Corp., Cupertino, USA, Model NO. 2002). The animals were followed up for 10 days and were inspected for signs of skin irritation and possible abscess formation. No signs of inflammation were found in the region after 10 days of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Transthoracal echocardiography</title><p>One day after injection of DOX, echocardiography was performed in the subgroup of DOX treated mice (n = 6) and compared to the normal animals (n = 6). The purpose of this examination was to validate the model of acute DOX-induced cardiotoxicity i.e. to detect and measure the extent of cardiac damage. The examination was performed according to the previously described method[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Echocardiographic images were obtained using a commercially available ultrasound system (ATL, Philip Medical System, Best) equipped with a 15 MHz linear transducer.</p></sec><sec><title>Survival study</title><p>A total of 70 mice were divided into the following four groups: mice treated with DOX and cod muscle extract (DOX + AOX, n = 20), mice treated with DOX receiving saline (DOX + NaCl, n = 30), normal mice treated with cod extract and saline (AOX + NaCl, n = 10) and normal mice treated only with saline (NaCl, n = 10) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The average daily doses of cod extract and saline given to the mice were 12 &#x003bc;L/day. The AOX + DOX and the AOX + NaCl groups were pre-treated with AOX by means of osmotic pumps. The DOX + NaCl and NaCl groups received 0.9% solution of NaCl in the same manner. After 8 days of pretreatment, the DOX + AOX and the DOX + NaCl group received a single dose of DOX (25 mg/kg, Pfizer, Sollentuna, Sweden) by means of intraperitoneal injection. The AOX + NaCl and NaCl groups were injected with 0.9% solution of NaCl in the same manner. Mortality and health conditions were monitored daily for 14 days.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematically depicted experimental study design.

The moisture results were expressed as percentage of wet weight. A Hamilton double pour electrode (Hamilton Double Pore, Bonaduz, Switzerland) in conjunction with a pH-meter (Radiometer analytical PHM210, Villeurbanne Cedex, France) was used for pH measurements.

These tests were based on the measurement of capacity to scavenge peroxyl radical activity using the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) test and to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) in stimulated human monocytes. The ORAC test, the method for isolating monocytes from human blood, and the method for analyzing whether the cod extract could prevent phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) initiated ROS formation of the monocytes is described by Gunnarsson et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In brief, the ROS-preventing effect of the cod extract was analyzed as a relative reduction in the isoluminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL) signal given by the monocyte-derived ROS. Thus, the CL-signal given by the monocytes in the presence of the cod extract was compared with a control assay where no extract was added.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Computer software (StatView 5.0.1) was used to perform standard statistical procedures. Mortality rate was tested using a 2 &#x000d7; 2 contingency table. Fisher's PLSD (Protected Least Significant Difference) test proceeded by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to detect significant differences between different treatments for interactions defined in advance. The value p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SEM.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animals treated with DOX have shown lower BW (data not shown), appeared weak and lethargic. At necropsy, the most prominent gross pathologic change in the mice treated with DOX was excessive amounts of pericardial, pleural and peritoneal fluid indicating the presence of systemic as well as local toxic effect. On a gross pathological cardiac examination the hearts of the DOX treated animals were enlarged and there were signs of pericarditis with multiple adhesions of connective tissue formed between the pericardium and the inner thoracic wall. Furthermore, the epicardial surface was rich in areas of local fibrosis. These signs were not present in the control animals. No difference in the BW was found between the DOX + AOX and the DOX + NaCl groups. The DOX + AOX mice had less pronounced accumulation of pericardial, pleural and peritoneal fluid compared to the DOX + NaCl mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses of myocardial purine nucleotides</title><p>There was no difference between the groups concerning the amount of myocardial ATP, ADP or AMP (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Myocardial content of purine nucleotides determined by HPLC</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center">ATP &#x003bc;mol/g</td><td align="center">ADP &#x003bc;mol/g</td><td align="center">AMP &#x003bc;mol/g</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">DOX + AOX (n = 8)</td><td align="center">16.2 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td align="center">9.2 &#x000b1; 0.8</td><td align="center">2.7 &#x000b1; 0.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">DOX + NaCl (n = 4)</td><td align="center">18.6 &#x000b1; 1.3</td><td align="center">9.0 &#x000b1; 0.3</td><td align="center">2.5 &#x000b1; 0.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">AOX + NaCl (n = 10)</td><td align="center">16.2 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center">10.0 &#x000b1; 0.4</td><td align="center">2.8 &#x000b1; 0.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">NaCl (n = 10)</td><td align="center">15.3 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center">10.0 &#x000b1; 0.3</td><td align="center">3.0 &#x000b1; 0.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>ATP = adenosine-tri-phosphate, ADP = adenosine-diphosphate, AMP = adenosine-monophosphate, AOX = codfish extract, DOX = doxorubicin, NaCl = saline</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Echocardiography</title><p>Echocardiography performed in the subgroup of the DOX-treated animals has demonstrated the presence of severely impaired LV function (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

The extract is characterized by pronounced free-radical scavenging effects <italic>in </italic>vitro.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the beneficial effect of an aqueous fish extract on survival rate in an <italic>in vivo </italic>animal model of acute heart failure. Cardioprotection has been in the research focus for many years. Different pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies have been proposed to decrease myocardial damage e.g. during ischemia-reperfusion injury and cardiotoxicity. However, only few experimental interventions have been translated into a clinical practice and with a limited success. Several studies have shown beneficial cardiovascular effects of fish and fish derived substances. By far the best known are the long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These fatty acids may enter the cellular membrane and alter membrane functions resulting in, e.g., antiarrhythmic effects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recent evidence indicates that dietary supplementation with fish oil preserves normal vasomotion of atherosclerotic coronary arteries and reduces damage to the myocardium after ischemia and reperfusion in animal models[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Much less is known whether aqueous components of fish, e.g. proteins, peptides, amino acids and other organic acids may protect the heart. On a wet weight basis, the aqueous phase usually contribute to 95&#x02013;99.5% of the total edible parts of seafoods. Indeed, the results of the present study provide the evidence that also aqueous fish-derived compounds may play an important role in cardioprotection.</p><p>The mouse model of DOX induced acute heart failure is suitable for screening studies and is well characterized in the literature[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We have verified the presence of acute CHF in the animals treated with DOX demonstrating that already one day after the exposure to the high-dose DOX, the indices of LV function were severely impaired with development of early pathologic LV remodeling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that the mortality rate after high-dose DOX reached ~90% in the untreated animals. Although several organ systems sustain damage in this model, the central role in the progression of the multiorgan failure is the failing heart. Acute myocardial injury is a result of pathophysiological abnormalities that are caused by direct toxic intracellular actions of DOX and include inhibition of nucleic acid and protein synthesis, release of vasoactive amines, alteration in adrenergic function, mitochondrial abnormalities, lysosomal changes, modification of sarcolemma Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transport, attenuation of adenyl-cyclase, Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, and Ca<sup>2++</sup>-ATPase activities, imbalance in myocardial electrolytes. However, most of the studies support the view that oxidative stress holds the central role in the development of these derangements (see ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] for review). Our study does not provide the exact explanation for the possible mechanisms behind the improved survival rate. Given the fact that cardiotoxicity with acute heart failure is the primary cause of death in this model, we speculate that the treatment was primarily cardioprotective. At the cellular level, this cardioprotection may have been mediated by antioxidative effects and/or by other mechanisms. Others have shown that increasing antioxidative capacity of the heart muscle suppresses cardiotoxicity of DOX[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The aqueous LMW-cod extract used in this study was reported to possess strong antioxidative effects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, it has not been previously evaluated whether this extract exerts antioxidative properties under physiological conditions. The results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> provide evidence for such an effect. The data from human monocytes in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> indicate that the capacity of the cod extract to prevent ROS-formation is ~50% at a 100-fold dilution! To evaluate the contribution of some individual compounds of the cod extract to its total antioxidative capacity (ORAC value) it was compared to some previously reported ORAC values for solutions of pure ascorbic acid and uric acid at the equimolar levels to those measured in the cod extract[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These substances had ORAC values three orders of magnitude lower than the cod extract, indicating that other compounds in the extract appear to be involved in its radical scavenging effect and/or that antioxidative substances require other LMW-compounds present at the same time for regeneration purposes. Which are the most likely candidates in the extract that have provided organ protection and survival benefit in this study? The LMW-compounds of fish muscle that has been ascribed antioxidative properties include ascorbic acid, uric acid, glutathione, various polyamines, histidine containing dipeptides (anserine, carnosine) and free amino acids (taurine, histidine). Based on the quantitative analyses (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>) we speculate that taurine and anserine might have been responsible for the most part of the protection. Taurine is generally found in high levels in seafood[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It is involved in radical scavenging, membrane regulation, osmoregulation and regulation of calcium homeostasis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In animal models and human trials in the settings of CHF, taurine was found to have beneficial effects on cardiac function and morphology[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Similarly, anserine has shown antioxidative effects at physiological levels in different in vitro systems[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. We did not find any differences between the groups in regard to myocardial contents of ATP, ADP or AMP. Unexpectedly the DOX treated groups did not show lower ATP levels. One possible explanation for this result may be the selection bias since this analysis was performed only on biopsies from the surviving mice.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Composition of total amino acids in Cod LMW-PJ (&#x0003c;500 Da).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Average g/L sample</td><td align="center">Cod LMW-PJ (&#x0003c;500 Da)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Taurine</td><td align="center">0.5 &#x000b1;
