There have been up to 2 million IDPs in northern Uganda alone. The objective of this study was to investigate factors associated with mental and physical health status of IDPs in northern Uganda.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A cross-sectional survey was conducted in November 2006 in IDP camps in the Gulu and Amuru districts of northern Uganda. The study outcome of physical and mental health was measured using the SF-8 instrument, which produces physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary measures. Independent demographic, socio-economic, and trauma exposure (using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire) variables were also measured. Multivariate regression linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate associations of the independent variables on the PCS and MCS outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>1206 interviews were completed. The respective mean PCS and MCS scores were 42.2 (95% CI 41.32 to 43.10) and 39.3 (95% CI 38.42 to 40.13), well below the instrument norm of 50, indicating poor health. Variables with negative associations with physical or mental health included gender, age, marital status, income, distance of camp from home areas, food security, soap availability, and sense of safety in the camp. A number of individual trauma variables and the frequency of trauma exposure also had negative associations with physical and mental health.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study provides evidence on the impact on health of deprivation of basic goods and services, traumatic events, and fear and uncertainty amongst displaced and crisis affected populations.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>There are over 45 million persons worldwide who have been forcibly displaced from their home areas due to conflict and insecurity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> Over 24 million of these are internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have remained within the boundaries of their own country.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> Research on the health of IDPs has focused upon specific physical and mental health conditions.

The study adopted a broad comprehension of health including physical, mental, emotional and social characteristics. Northern Uganda was selected for the study because up to 2 million IDPs have been displaced as a result of the 20-year conflict waged between a rebel group, the Lord&#x02019;s Resistance Army, and the central government. The IDPs are largely based in the most conflict-affected districts of Gulu, Amuru, Kitgum and Pader, which are mainly populated by the Acholi people. Approximately 85% of the IDPs in northern Uganda live in government-organised camps established to protect civilians and aid the government&#x02019;s counter-insurgency campaign.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> The camps are characterised by chronic over-crowding, insecurity, social problems and illness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref></p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The study took place in November 2006 in the Gulu and Amuru districts of northern Uganda. The two districts contain an estimated 650&#x02009;000 IDPs, which is approximately 40% of all IDPs in Uganda.

The selection of independent variables was informed by a systematic literature review and consultations with humanitarian and academic staff from Gulu, Kampala, Geneva and London. The selected independent variables were: age, religion, ethnicity, education level, period of displacement, number of camps lived, distance of camp from home area, number of persons per household, latrine use, water source, hygiene/use of soap, food security, income source and amount, health knowledge, utilisation of health services, sense of safety in camps and alcohol intake (using the AUDIT instrument<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).

This required adequate power (80%) to detect conceptually important differences (0.8 standard deviation) in the health outcomes within a multivariate analysis with a significance level of 5% with the size of the &#x0201c;rarest&#x0201d; sub-group of respondents at 5%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> To account for the clustered design, a design effect of 2.0 was included, which doubled the required sample size.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> The expected proportion of unusable questionnaires was set at 10%.</p><p>An adapted multi-stage cluster sampling method was used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> The first stage randomly selected clusters from which the camps would be chosen. The sampling frame was a list of the total population of IDPs living in all the 65 officially recognised IDP camps in the Gulu and Amuru districts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> Thirty-two clusters were chosen rather than the more common use of 30 clusters to reduce the design effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> The 32 clusters were selected using the probability proportional to size technique to self-weight the clusters.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> The 32 clusters were allocated to 28 IDP camps using this process. The total population living in the 28 selected camps was 452&#x02009;702.</p><p>Due to the large population size of the camps, a second stage was used to randomly select administrative zones within the sampled IDP camps to serve as clusters. These were estimated to be of similar population sizes based upon discussions with camp and zone leaders, and so self-weighting was maintained. The third stage consisted of randomly choosing individuals from the selected clusters. As the clusters were already self-weighted, the same number of individuals were chosen from within each of the selected clusters. The Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) method was used to randomly select households for this stage and one individual was then randomly selected from the eligible individuals within the household.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> Two study staff conducted stage 2 and 3 of the sampling process through a &#x0201c;pre-visit&#x0201d; one or two days prior to the actual day of data collection. In stage 3, if the randomly selected person was not present, another adult member of the household or a neighbour was asked to inform the selected person to attend the data collection. It was advised that replacements would not be accepted and precautions were taken to reduce risk of replacements.</p><p>A team of 15 data collectors were recruited for the survey (eight men and seven women) who were all from the Acholi region of northern Uganda and spoke fluent Luo and English. Six days training was provided for the study. The data collection took place between 6 and 27 November 2006. Each interview took approximately 35&#x02013;45 minutes.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Ethics</title><p>Ethical approval for the study was provided by the Ugandan National Council for Science and Technology, Gulu University, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. A consent form was used to ensure informed consent and clarify that no direct benefit could be expected from participating in the study. All data collected were confidential and anonymous. As some of the questions were on traumatic experiences, referral information for support on mental health was provided. One of the study team was a psychiatrist and one of the team leaders was a double-trained Clinical Psychiatric Officer/Mental Health Nurse who could offer advice if required. Supervision and quality control were provided by the three members of the study team and two team leaders.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Two data entry clerks were used to enter the data into SPSS, version 14.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA). All analysis was performed using STATA version 9.2 (Stata Corporation, College Park, Texas, USA) and adjusted for the clustered design. A univariate linear regression analysis was firstly conducted to explore associations between all independent variables on PCS and MCS. The independent variables that showed statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.05) associations were then included for multivariate linear regression analysis, and adjusted to address the influence of the other significant variables. This followed a stepwise approach with forward selection and backward regression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> The statistically significant variables (p&#x0003c;0.05) remaining in the model were included in the final results. Positive coefficients indicate a positive association with higher PCS or MCS scores (i.e. better physical or mental health). Negative coefficients indicate a negative association with PCS or MCS scores (i.e. worse physical or mental health). Interaction tests were conducted to explore if the effect of one independent variable on PCS or MCS significantly varied (p&#x0003c;0.05) according to the level of the effects of another independent variable within the overall regression model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The total number of completed individual interviews was 1206.

Absence of soap from a household also had a negative association with physical health, and this could contribute to diarrhoeal disease and worsening physical health. Soap may also act as a proxy for other factors not captured in the analysis. Variables of income (&#x0003c;50&#x02009;000 Ush) and food security (food&#x0003c;5 days) showed a negative association with mental health. This could be explained by the uncertainty and anxiety caused by limited income and food insecurity and has also been noted in studies on specific mental health conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref></p><p>The study provides evidence on the effects of traumatic events on both physical health and mental health. Traumatic events with significant associations on worse physical health included being ill without access to medical care, narrowly escaping death and being seriously injured. Traumatic events associated with worse mental health include the murder of family/friend, narrowly escaping death, being forced to accept ideas (brainwashing), rape and sexual abuse. The negative association of these variables correspond with studies on specific mental health outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> The negative association of trauma variables such as illness without access to medical care and deprivation of food and water with mental health highlight the strong effect that the absence basic goods and services can have upon mental health. A number of sources of emotional support were reported by respondents, but the only one that showed a significant association with better mental health was support by family members.</p><p>There is a strong association between frequency of exposure to trauma events with poor physical health and mental health.

This study provides evidence on the impact of displacement and deprivation of basic goods and services on both physical and mental health. The study also found a strong association of the frequency and type of exposure to traumatic events on both poor physical and mental health. The study calls for greater assistance and protection for internally displaced persons to improve overall health.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors&#x02019; contributions: Study concept and design: Bayard Roberts, Kaducu Felix Ocaka, John Browne, Thomas Oyok, Egbert Sondorp.</p><p>Data collection: Bayard Roberts, Kaducu Felix Ocaka, Thomas Oyok.</p><p>Analysis and review of data analysis: Bayard Roberts, John Browne.</p><p>Drafting and review of the manuscript: Bayard Roberts, John Browne, Kaducu Felix Ocaka, Thomas Oyok, Egbert Sondorp.</p><p>Assistance with data for the sample frame was provided by the World Food Programme (Gulu Office) and the International Organisation for Migration (Gulu Office).
