[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] During the last decades efforts to provide reliable diagnostic criteria for IBS have been undertaken, starting with the criteria of Manning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and the consensuses of Rome I, II and III. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] Classification criteria such as Rome II developed through experts consensus may be less applicable to primary care IBS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and their implementation in primary and secondary health care settings does not seem to be widely adopted. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]</p><p>In Greece the subject of functional gastrointestinal disorders in primary health care seems to be neglected.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] A recent study in rural Crete revealed that primary care physicians failed to diagnose these disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] This cross-sectional study led to the development of a database of patients with IBS. The advent of the new consensus (Rome III) on the diagnosis of IBS was an important incentive to explore to what extent the application of the new standards alters the diagnosis previously made within the primary care setting in Crete. This paper seeks to explore issues of diagnostic suitability and applicability of different classification criteria when they are used for IBS patients in primary care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Setting and study population</title><p>The medical records of four Primary Health Care (PHC) centers and one primary surgery were reviewed from March 1996 till February 2000 with a methodology explained elsewhere.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] All the patients with the diagnosis of IBS or spastic colitis or functional disorders of the large bowel were pooled together as IBS patients (ICPC 2: D93/ICD10: K58). The estimated occurrence rate of the IBS patients in this cross-sectional study was 1.2 per 1000 person-years. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] This low IBS rate was attributed to the free access that Greek patients have to public health services without prior referral from their primary care centre. It was also uncertain to what extend patients with IBS were experiencing minor symptoms and thus they did not seek medical care from their primary care physicians. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] Patients with IBS in this Cretan database were mostly women older than 70 and this fact can explain the high occurrence rate of IBS in people older than 65 years. However, both findings from this report need to be verified in future studies in this region.</p><p>All the identified IBS patients were considered eligible for a structured interview.</p></sec><sec><title>Instruments</title><p>Each of the eligible patients was personally invited to a semi-structured interview. All interviews were performed by the same researcher during scheduled home visits and were based on a detailed personal and family history questionnaire. Co-morbidity and medication were documented both through direct questions during the interview and by patient's personal insurance book. The Manning criteria for IBS and the Rome II criteria for IBS and dyspepsia were applied. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]</p><p>The questionnaire for the identification of dyspepsia in the general population (IDGP), which was translated and validated into Greek [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] was applied in order to document co-morbidity with dyspepsia and GERD. It consists of 11 main questions answered by yes or no, on upper gastrointestinal symptoms together with frequencies and consultation behavior, and one open question. The questionnaire for the identification of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] was also used. This questionnaire based on the Rome I criteria through nine different sets of questions provides a detailed picture of patients gastrointestinal problems.

In previous studies the criteria of Manning and the Rome III criteria were found more sensitive in diagnosing IBS patients in primary care compared to Rome II. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] The complexity of questions about the duration of symptoms might have played an important role for the difference between the Rome II and III criteria. It is also supported that criteria that are based on the frequency of symptoms have lower prevalence values compared to criteria based on the presence of symptoms. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] Our findings indicate that IBS diagnosis in rural areas of Crete has not been based on complex criteria. In the same vein, the FGIDs questionnaire revealed fewer patients as having IBS than the Manning and Rome II criteria and showed low agreement compared with all the criteria. This questionnaire was expected to be more restrictive in the primary care population as there is a strong argument that primary care patients have different disease characteristics than outpatients. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]</p><p>High co-morbidity with GERD like symptoms was noted. The observed rate in our study (46%) was among the highest reported according to a review of the international literature. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] It is difficult to explain this prominent overlap and although both conditions are highly prevalent, the overlapping symptoms are lately attributed to a possible common disease process. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] Co morbidity with dyspepsia was relatively low (10.4%) compared with other studies. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]</p></sec><sec><title>The study findings in the light of other studies</title><p>Criteria developed by specialists have been criticized for low performance in primary care.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] Skepticism as to the degree of relevance of Rome diagnostic criteria for IBS with everyday clinical primary practice is developing and authors have suggested that the next consensus meeting on IBS should be interdisciplinary. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] Our results are in agreement with international literature on the low application of diagnostic criteria for IBS and especially the Rome II.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] The Rome III criteria are considered as less restrictive and thus closer to primary care reality,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] but in our study this role was not verified. In the Greek primary setting the number of visits to the doctor due to IBS was found low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] compared to international data. In another study from Crete, again, IBS patients reported that they did not visit the PHC centre for their IBS problems frequently. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] All data form a puzzle showing that in IBS patients in rural areas of Crete, both actual and as perceived by individuals, symptoms are rather underestimated. Further research is needed to confirm it.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Our study used the database of IBS patients identified in medical records in a retrospective research. Information as to what criteria were applied by primary care doctors was not available. In most cases the diagnosis alone was the only available data. Also poor demographic data entries resulted in high numbers of excluded or non-participating patients limiting in this way the strength of the results. For the majority of the non participating patients there were no available data about the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus a potential selection bias could be addressed. It should also be noted that although Cohen's kappa statistic is an extremely widely used measure of agreement at the present time in the biomedical literature, certain "paradoxes" in its interpretation have been noted in relation to unbalanced marginal totals, and also its dependence on the prevalence of the condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Another limitation was the use of modified questions matching the Rome III instead of the actual Rome III criteria for a retrospective comparison. A similar approach was attempted in another study the results of which followed the pre existing research on Rome III. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] Our study provides a hint on the application of the Rome III in IBS patients in rural Crete at a time where no other information is available.</p><p>The 6.4 years interval between the first diagnosis and the structured interview is another limitation as it could allow changes and overlaps with other gastrointestinal diseases, a finding common in IBS patients. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]This interval did not allow a direct comparison between the criteria and doctor's diagnosis, but the retrospective comparison between criteria at the time of interview was possible.</p></sec><sec><title>Implementation to practice and suggestions for future research</title><p>The low agreement between older and new criteria and the tendency for greater fulfillment of the criteria of Manning; reveal the necessity for a different approach to the diagnosis of IBS in primary care in rural areas of Greece. This approach has been also highlighted in a consensus development for the diagnosis of IBS in primary care. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] Clinical manifestations of IBS and co morbidity with other gastrointestinal diseases; both in primary care patient and the general population in rural Greece; should also be investigated in order to obtain a clear picture of the syndrome.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In Greek primary care, international diagnostic criteria display low agreement for the diagnosis of IBS. Amongst these, the newest criteria display worse results than expected. Questionnaires and criteria deriving from tertiary hospitals or expert's consensus meetings seem to be applied with difficulty in rural primary care where symptoms are underestimated by patients and complicated questions can be confusing.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>IBS: Irritable Bowel Syndrome; IDGP: Identification of Dyspepsia in the General Population questionnaire; FGIDs: Identification of Functional Gastrointestinal Diseases questionnaire; GERD: Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease; PHC: Primary Health Centre</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The research programme received a grand from AstraZeneca Sweden.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CL, HC, IM, and FA conceived the idea.
