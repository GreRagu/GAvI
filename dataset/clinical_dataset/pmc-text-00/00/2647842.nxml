Gene expression profiling was used to characterize the transcriptional response to HCV H77c infection. Evidence is presented for activation of innate antiviral signaling pathways as well as induction of lipid metabolism genes, which may contribute to oxidative stress. We also found that infection of chimeric <italic>SCID/Alb-uPA</italic> mice by HCV led to signs of hepatocyte damage and apoptosis, which in patients plays a role in activation of stellate cells, recruitment of macrophages, and the subsequent development of fibrosis. Infection of chimeric mice with HCV H77c also led an inflammatory response characterized by infiltration of monocytes and macrophages. There was increased apoptosis in HCV-infected human hepatocytes in H77c-infected mice but not in mice inoculated with a replication incompetent H77c mutant. Moreover, TUNEL reactivity was restricted to HCV-infected hepatocytes, but an increase in FAS expression was not. To gain insight into the factors contributing specific apoptosis of HCV infected cells, immunohistological and confocal microscopy using antibodies for key apoptotic mediators was done. We found that the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78 was increased in HCV-infected cells as was activated BAX, but the activator of ER stress&#x02013;mediated apoptosis CHOP was not. We found that overall levels of NF-&#x003ba;B and BCL-xL were increased by infection; however, within an infected liver, comparison of infected cells to uninfected cells indicated both NF-&#x003ba;B and BCL-xL were decreased in HCV-infected cells. We conclude that HCV contributes to hepatocyte damage and apoptosis by inducing stress and pro-apoptotic BAX while preventing the induction of anti-apoptotic NF-&#x003ba;B and BCL-xL, thus sensitizing hepatocytes to apoptosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Hepatitis C virus is a common cause of liver disease worldwide.

HCV is a blood borne pathogen which is a major cause of liver disease worldwide, with an estimated 200 million people infected.

HCV is now the leading indication for liver transplantation in North America <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Roberts1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Due the absence of a proofreading activity in the viral RNA polymerase, HCV has a high mutation rate that contributes to the genetic heterogeneity of the virus. Six different genotypes, and at least 52 subtypes have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Timm1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Chronic infection by HCV results in a highly variable disease course, and despite advances in the molecular virology of HCV, the factors involved in hepatocyte injury and the progression of liver disease remain unclear. The complexity of the host response has been examined by transcriptional profiling of liver biopsy samples from both chimpanzees and humans. These studies show that HCV induces genes involved in the interferon response, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and chemokines, as well as markers of inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Bigger1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Smith1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Such studies are hampered by the requirement that infected and uninfected hepatocytes come from different patients and also by the presence of an adaptive immune response in the patients. Gene expression profiles of human hepatocytes from <italic>SCID/Alb-uPA</italic> chimeric mice infected with HCV patient serum, control these variables <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Walters1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Until recently it has been thought that HCV is a non-cytopathic virus and that hepatocyte damage in chronic HCV infection is due to HCV-specific adaptive immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Nelson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Kanto1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Increased expression of stimulators of apoptosis in HCV infected patients is tempered by hepatocyte insensitivity to death ligand mediated apoptosis.

We confirmed the results of the previous study that used infectious patient serum, and to determine the cause of hepatocyte damage, we examined the expression HCV antigens and key proteins involved in the stress response and apoptosis using immunohistochemical and fluorescent confocal microscopy. We found that HCV infection correlated with increased levels of the ER chaperone GPR78/BiP, a key regulator of the unfolded protein response. In addition, levels of pro-apoptotic BAX were increased, while anti-apoptotic NF-&#x003ba;B and BCL-xL were decreased in HCV infected cells. Taken together these results indicate that ER stress induced by HCV combined with lower NF-&#x003ba;B and BCL-xL levels sensitizes hepatocytes to apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Previous studies indicated HCV infection in chimeric mouse livers was restricted to the human hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Mercer1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. We confirmed this by performing immunofluorescent confocal microscopy on uninfected and HCV H77c infected mouse livers with antibodies specific for the HCV NS3 protease and human albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000291.s001">S1A&#x02013;B</xref>). Only liver sections infected with HCV H77c stained with HCV specific antibodies, and this was restricted to hepatocytes that also were also stained with antibodies specific for human albumin. Since liver consists of a mix a hepatocytes and adventitial cells, and albumin only stains hepatocytes, there was the possibility that some human cells other than hepatocytes also colonized the mouse liver. Therefore we wished to examine whether any of the adventitial cells were also human. We performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization using probes specific for human <italic>Alu</italic> repeats on chimeric mouse livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Only the hepatocytes were stained, indicating all of the adventitial cells in chimeric mouse livers were of mouse origin. This, and the elimination of a small percentage of mouse sequences that cross-hybridized to the human arrays, ensured that the transcriptional profiling reflects only the processes occurring in human hepatocytes.</p><fig id="ppat-1000291-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000291.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Confocal microscopy of uninfected and HCV H77c infected mouse livers stained with anti-HCV and anti-human albumin.</title><p>Confocal microscopy was performed on either uninfected (A) or H77c infected (B&#x02013;F) liver sections.

All animals contained hepatocytes from a single donor. The serum HCV titers, liver viral loads, and the length of time infected are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000291-t001">Table 1</xref>. The experiments included three liver samples from an animal infected with H77c (&#x0002b;) serum (990), two samples from an animal inoculated intrahepatically with H77c RNA (975), and a single experiment with liver tissue from an animal inoculated intrahepatically with H77c RNA containing a mutation in the active site of the NS5B polymerase (986). Four samples from three separate animals were pooled to serve as the uninfected control. Because each pair of mice contained hepatocytes from the same donor, changes in gene expression should mainly be induced by the HCV infection and be independent of host variation. Consistent with previous studies, the effect on host gene expression by HCV infection was not extreme, 766 genes showed a 2-fold or higher change in expression (P value&#x02264;0.05) in at least one experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The grouping of experiments by the clustering algorithm suggested that the effect on host gene expression was very similar among individual pieces of liver from the same animal. Importantly, the global gene expression profiles in the animals infected with H77c (&#x0002b;) serum (990) and H77c RNA (975) were also very similar. This suggests that the source of HCV inoculum does not significantly impact the host transcriptional response to infection. Interestingly, the animal inoculated with H77c RNA encoding an inactive NS5B polymerase also showed a similar host response.

In general, the induction was similar among all three infected animals. However, there does seem to be a slightly higher induction of ISGs in the animal (975) inoculated intrahepatically with wild-type H77c RNA relative to the animal (990) inoculated with H77c (&#x0002b;) serum, which is likely due to the high level of naked RNA injected directly into the liver of this animal (100 &#x000b5;g, 2&#x000d7;10<sup>13</sup> copies). This increased response relative the animal inoculated with serum (990) was not observed in the animal (986) injected with H77c RNA containing inactive NS5B, indicating that part of the increased response in animal 975 might be due to replication of the inoculated HCV RNA. In our previous study of mice infected with HCV-positive patient sera the magnitude of induction of ISGs varies among mice containing hepatocytes from different donors. Comparison of the gene expression data from HCV H77c-infected mice with that from the initial study indicate the induction of ISGs in the H77c-infected mice is relatively weak. Consistent with what was observed in animals with a weak IFN response in the initial study, regulation of numerous genes associated with lipid metabolism were observed in the HCV H77c-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These included genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, &#x003b2;-oxidation and peroxisome proliferation. There did not appear to be any significant differences due to inoculum source. Interestingly, the animal that received replication incompetent H77c RNA also showed some regulation of these genes, although at a lower magnitude. The fact that this mouse shows any changes at all, in the absence of viral replication, may be because injection of viral RNA from a positive-sense RNA virus likely results in the synthesis of viral proteins.</p><fig id="ppat-1000291-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000291.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Expression of IFN-inducible and lipid metabolism genes in human liver tissue from HCV-infected mice.</title><p>The gene sets were IFN-inducible (A), or involved in lipid metabolism (B).

Steatosis was apparent in the majority of the human hepatocytes regardless of infection. However, there were significant differences in the histology between the animals inoculated with HCV RNA and naive animals. Increased hepatocyte ballooning and lobular inflammation were associated with HCV-infection. Staining of sections with the antibody F4-80 (anti CD68) revealed that the lobular inflammation was due to infiltration of monocytes and macrophages (not shown). A particularly intriguing observation was the presence of apoptotic hepatocytes in HCV-infected animals originally detected as caspase-3 activation and quantitation of apoptotic bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Walters1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Apoptosis was absent in the animal inoculated with the replication defective H77c-AAA mutant. This suggests that apoptosis observed in HCV-infected mice is dependent upon active HCV replication. The expression of genes associated with cell death was analyzed to gain further insight into possible mechanisms of apoptosis. While there was regulation of cell-death related genes in HCV H77c infected animals, the number of genes affected is small (data not shown).

Similar to what has been seen in mice infected with patient serum and in patient biopsies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Walters1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, there was increased FAS staining in infected compared to donor matched uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g005">Figure 5A&#x02013;C</xref>). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g005">Figure 5</xref> and at higher magnification in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000291.s002">Figure S2</xref>, there was strong FAS reactivity in a majority of the human cells in infected mice, however TUNEL positive nuclei were seen only in a small proportion of human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g005">Figure 5D&#x02013;F</xref>). Interestingly, although staining was not as intense, there was an increase in FAS staining in the mouse inoculated with the H77c-AAA mutant, without a correlative increase in the TUNEL positive nuclei (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000291-t002">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that increased FAS expression is not the only factor required for induction of apoptosis and TUNEL reactivity. We next investigated the correlation between HCV infection, and either FAS expression, or TUNEL reactivity. When we stained liver sections with FAS- and HCV-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), we found that expression of FAS does not depend on the presence of HCV in the cells, but is a host reaction to infection of neighbouring cells. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that only a portion of cells in the liver express enough HCV antigen to be detected using this antibody. When we subjected liver sections to a fluorescent TUNEL assay and then stained them with HCV specific antibodies, we found that all of the TUNEL positive cells in areas populated by human hepatocytes also stained with HCV specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The exception was that some murine Kupffer cells which also contained multiple TUNEL positive nuclei. Thus, HCV replication seems to be required for hepatocyte apoptosis. This is unlike FAS expression, which could be induced by HCV replication in neighbouring cells.</p><fig id="ppat-1000291-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000291.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Confocal microscopic analysis of HCV antigen expression and either FAS expression or TUNEL reactivity.</title><p>Staining for FAS (A) or TUNEL reactivity (B) was performed as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, using primary mouse anti-HCV and either rabbit anti-human FAS (A), or for TUNEL, FITC labeled dUTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (B).

To examine the role of ER stress in HCV induced apoptosis, we compared the expression of the ER chaperone GRP78 (BiP) in uninfected and H77c infected mice by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000291-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g007">Figure 7A&#x02013;C</xref>) and by fluorescent confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g007">Figure 7D, E</xref>). We found higher levels of BiP in infected mice, and that BiP expression correlated with HCV infection. Additionally, BiP and HCV seemed to co-localize, consistent with replication of HCV on the ER. The ER chaperone BiP is a key sensor in the unfolded protein response (UPR); it maintains ER membrane signal proteins in inactive states. It has been shown that BAX and BAK interact directly with one of these membrane signal proteins, IRE1, and are essential for IRE1 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Hetz1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Extensive or prolonged ER stress initiates apoptosis through activation of BAX/BAK. We therefore examined the expression of BAX in liver sections (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000291-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g008">Figure 8</xref>) and found BAX was also overexpressed in HCV infected livers. BAX is normally diffusely expressed throughout the cell, however when activated it translocates to the mitochondria and appears as a granular staining pattern. We found that both patterns of staining were elevated in HCV infected livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g008">Figure 8A&#x02013;D</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g008">Figure 8D</xref> shows both the intense granular staining pattern as indicated by the black arrows and the less intense cytoplasmic staining indicated by the red arrows. The large granular staining pattern correlated with HCV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). It is worth noting that not all cells that stained positive for HCV also showed activated BAX. The number of cells staining for activated BAX approximately correlated with the number of TUNEL positive nuclei. The elevation of both BiP and BAX in the absence of increased levels of p53 suggests that ER rather than oxidative stress leads to BAX activation, however additional mechanisms of BAX activation by oxidative stress cannot be eliminated.</p><fig id="ppat-1000291-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000291.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Immunohistochemical and confocal microscopic analysis of BiP/Grp78 expression.</title><p>BiP expression was examined by either immunohistochemistry (A&#x02013;C) or confocal microscopy (D&#x02013;E).

Previous studies have shown that the transcriptional response HCV infection in mice is similar to that of humans and chimpanzees, with the exception of immune cell markers, which are absent in SCID mice.

Interestingly, in the absence of an adaptive immune system, there was evidence for the induction of apoptosis in HCV infected mice. This was restricted to HCV infected cells despite increased FAS expression on both infected and uninfected human hepatocytes of infected animals. This generalized FAS expression may be a consequence of the interferon response occurring throughout the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Walters1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> since FAS/FASL are among those mediators of apoptosis that are also interferon response genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-ChawlaSarkar1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We therefore examined processes leading to apoptosis that we thought were likely to be affected by HCV in infected cells. Oxidative stress generated by HCV induced lipid metabolism, and ER stress generated by HCV replication and protein translation in and on the ER were both potential candidates. Hepatocytes are type II cells that contain low levels of caspase 8 and therefore require activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis amplification pathway to initiate apoptosis. This can be blocked by over expression of BCL-2 or BCL-xL. Mitochondria seem to be the site where the antiviral interferon response and apoptotic signals are integrated; recently it has been shown that the mitochondrial signaling molecule interferon promoter stimulating factor-1 (IPS-1) is cleaved during apoptosis and cleavage can be blocked by overexpression of BCL-xL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Scott1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, both the response to oxidative stress and the response to ER stress converge at the mitochondrion; p53 activated by oxidative stress stimulates the oligomerization of BAX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Chipuk1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, and BiP responding to ER stress releases IRE-1 to which BAX is bound.

Furthermore consistent with the transcriptional regulation of BCL-xL by NF-&#x003ba;B, we found that total levels of BCL-xL were lower in HCV infected cells. In conclusion, we propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g011">Figure 11</xref>) where HCV induces both ER stress and oxidative stress in infected cells, and activates pro-apoptotic Bax while it prevents induction of anti-apoptotic BCL-xL thus sensitizing HCV infected cells to apoptosis which may be mediated by death receptors and ligands, for example FAS and TRAIL (TNFSF10-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). A combination of induction of pro-inflammatory chemokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000291-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and cross talk between human and mouse chemokines and their receptors may lead to a situation similar to that in patients; inflammation, which in turn stimulates release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and effector molecules such as TNF-&#x003b1; and FasL (which in these mice may be released by macrophages and NK cells), creating the circle of hepatocyte damage and repair that is a hallmark of HCV infection.</p><fig id="ppat-1000291-g011" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000291.g011</object-id><label>Figure 11</label><caption><title>HCV sensitizes infected hepatocytes to apoptosis.</title><p>The pathways that link oxidative and ER stress with apoptosis are shown, as is a potential interaction between the host cell response and apoptosis.

Spot quantitation, normalization and application of a platform-specific error model was performed using Agilent's Feature Extractor software and all data was then entered into a custom-designed database, Expression Array Manager, and then uploaded into Rosetta Resolver System 4.0.1.0.10 (Rosetta Biosoftware, Kirkland, WA) and Spotfire Decision Suite 7.1.1 (Spotfire, Somerville, MA). Data normalization and the Resolver Error Model are described on the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://expression.microslu.washington.edu">http://expression.microslu.washington.edu</ext-link>. This website is also used to publish all primary data in accordance with the proposed MIAME standards. Selection of genes for data analysis was based on a greater than 95&#x00025; probability of being differentially expressed (<italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.05) and a fold change of 2 or greater. The resultant false positive discovery rate was estimated to be less than 0.1&#x00025; (Walters, unpublished data). We have previously assessed the degree of cross hybridization in chimeric samples and eliminated the small percentage of genes that did cross react from subsequent analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Walters2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy</title><p><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization using FITC labeled Alu DNA probes (InnoGenex, San Ramon, CA, USA) was performed according to the manufacturer's specifications, and developed using the supersensitive polymer HRP-ISH system (BioGenex). TUNEL was performed using the Apoptag Plus Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The number of Tunel positive nuclei is an average of 15 fields at 200&#x000d7; magnification.</p><p>Haematoxylin and eosin, reticulin, Mason's trichrome, and periodic acid/Shiffs staining were performed according to standard procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Drury1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>. The sections were graded for inflammatory activity and staged for fibrosis according to the modified Batts and Ludwig scoring system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Batts1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>. The degree of fatty change was scored as 0 (&#x0003c;5&#x00025;), 1 (6&#x02013;33&#x00025;), 2 (34&#x02013;66&#x00025;) or 3 (&#x0003e;66&#x00025;). Hepatocyte ballooning and macrophages were scored on a scale of 0&#x02013;4 where 0 is none and 4 is many. The lobular apoptotic body count is an average of 5 fields counted at 100&#x000d7; magnification.</p><p>Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analysis was performed on 4 &#x000b5;m formaldehyde fixed paraffin embedded sections that were deparaffinized by incubation in xylene for 5 min, followed by sequential rehydration by incubating twice for 3 min in each of 100&#x00025;, 95&#x00025;, and 70&#x00025; ethanol, followed by a 5 min incubation in distilled water. Antigen retrieval was then performed by boiling in pH 6.0 10 mM citrate buffer for 15 min followed by cooling for an additional 15 min.</p><p>For immunohistochemical staining with rabbit anti-FAS antibodies (1&#x02236;50, Santa Cruz), or rabbit anti-BAX (1&#x02236;50, Cell Signaling Technologies), or purified rabbit IgG isotype control, slides were blocked in normal goat serum, washed, incubated with the primary antibodies, washed, incubated with 3&#x00025; peroxide, and incubated with secondary goat anti rabbit poly-HRP antibodies (Dako Cytomation). The peroxidase was developed using the DAB Plus liquid substrate chromogen system (Dako Cytomation). For staining with goat anti-GRP78/BiP antibodies (1&#x02236;50 Santa Cruz) or purified goat IgG isotype control, slides were blocked with normal donkey serum, incubated with primary antibody, endogenous biotin was blocked using the avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector laboratories), and the signal was amplified using the ABC method (Vector laboratories). The peroxidase was developed as before. Caspase staining was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000291-Walters1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. FAS staining was scored semi-quantitatively where 0 is no staining, 1 (1&#x02013;25&#x00025;), 2 (26&#x02013;50&#x00025;), 3 (51&#x02013;75&#x00025;) and 4 (76&#x02013;100&#x00025;). Caspase staining was scored semi-quantitatively as follows: 0&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;none, 1&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;focal weak, 2&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;diffuse weak; 3&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;diffuse weak and focal strong; 4&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;diffuse strong. GRP78/BiP staining was scored semi-quantitatively where 0 is no staining, 1 (1&#x02013;15&#x00025;), 2 (16&#x02013;30&#x00025;), and 3 (31&#x02013;50&#x00025;). The intensity of the stain was also scored on a scale of 0&#x02013;3, where 0 is no staining and 3 is intense staining. Since activated activated BAX has a distinct punctate staining that can be easily distinguished form inactive BAX, active and inactive BAX was scored on separate semi-quantitative scales. Inactive Bax was scored in the same manner as BiP, and the scale for activated Bax was 0 is no staining, 1(1&#x02013;5&#x00025;), 2 (5&#x02013;10&#x00025;), and 3 (10&#x02013;15&#x00025;).</p><p>For immunofluorescent confocal microscopy, the slides were deparaffinized, the antigens retrieved as before, and blocked as before. Additional blocking using mouse IgG (0.1 mg/ml) for 1 hour, followed by incubation with goat anti mouse-IgG (1 mg/ml) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C was done prior to incubation with mouse anti HCV NS3/4 diluted 1&#x02236;50 (TORDJI-22, Abcam), or its isotype control, and one of rabbit anti-FAS, BAX, GADD (Santa Cruz), NF-&#x003ba;B p65 (C-20 Santa Cruz), BCL-xL (Cell Signaling Technologies), or rabbit IgG all diluted 1&#x02236;50, or rabbit anti human Albumin diluted 1&#x02236;1000 (Dako Cytomation). Slides were blocked with 3&#x00025; peroxide prior to incubation with goat anti mouse poly HRP and goat anti rabbit Alexa 488 (diluted 1&#x02236;100, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). The peroxidase was developed using the TSA Plus fluorescence system with tyramide-tetramethyl red (Perkin Elmer). Mounting media (Vectastain-Vector laboratories) contained 1 &#x000b5;g/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). For BiP/GRP78, the staining procedure was essentially the same, except slides were blocked with normal donkey serum and avidin/biotin block (Vector laboratories), the primary antibodies were goat anti-GRP78/Bip with the mouse anti-HCV, and the secondary antibodies were donkey anti-goat alexa 488 (Molecular probes), and donkey anti-mouse biotin, followed by avidin-HRP (Vector laboratories). The peroxidase was developed as before.</p><p>For co-localization of HCV antigens and TUNEL reactivity, the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (fluorescein) (Roche) was used, according to the manufacturer's specifications. The incubation with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was carried out prior to incubation with the primary TORDJI-22 antibody. All subsequent steps were carried out as before. Nuclei were stained using DAPI. Confocal microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss scanning LSM510 microscope with the 351 nm, 488, and 543 nm excitation lines, and digital images were collected with a 1 &#x000b5;m optical slice.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>The accession numbers for the genes/proteins discussed in this manuscript are the following: HCV-H77c AF011751, TNF-&#x003b1; X20910, FAS M67454, FASL U11821, BiP/GRP78 NM_005347, p53 AF307851, CHOP/GADD153 BC003637, BAX NM138763, BCL-Xl Z23115, BCL-2 M14745, NF-&#x003ba;B p65 Z22751, Caspase-8 U60520, Caspase-3 BC016926, CD68 S57235, RIG-I AF038963, IPS-1-Q7Z434, TLR-3 U88879, TRIF AB086380, IL28RA AY129153, CMKOR1 BC008459, IFITM1 J04164, HLA-DRB5 NM_002125, IFIT1 M24594, IFIT2 M14660, B2M AB021288, HLA-A D3219, HLA-B M15470, HLA-F AY253269, HLA-G NM_002127, GBP1 BC002666, BIRC4BP X99699, CXCL11 U66096, CXCL10 X02530, CXCL9 X72755, PSMB9 NM_002800, OAS3 AF063613, OAS1 X04371, OASL AF063611, STAT1 NM_007315, G1P3 BC15603, G1P2 BC009507, IFI44 D28915, IFI27 X67325, ANGPTL4 AF202636, NR4A1 L13740, BDKRB2 S56772, EPO X02157, PPARGC1A AF106698, PCK1 NM_002591, ARG2 D86724, APOA5 AF202889, AVP M25647, CPT1A L39211, MT1A BC029475, FABP5 M94856, RXRA X52773, SREBF1 BC057388, PLIN AB005293, C11orf11 AB014559, APOF L27050, HPX J03048, CYP1A1 BC023019, SAA2 M26152, THRSP Y0809, SCD AF097514, PBP NM_04139, ACSS2 AF263614, GCK AF041014, FDPS J05262, HMGCR NM_000859, CYP51A1 U51685, SQLE D78130, HSD17B6 AF016509, C5 M57729, FTFD1 X69141, RDH16 NM_003708, TNFSF10 U37518, SC4MOL U93162, HMGCS1 NM_002130, IRE1 AF059198, PERK AF110146, ATF6 AB015856, hAAT X01683.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000291.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Isotype controls for anti-HCV, FAS, and GRP78/Bip antibodies.
