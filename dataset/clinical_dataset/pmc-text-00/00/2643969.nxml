However, little is known about whether this abnormal skin response is associated with genetic loading for schizophrenia. This study compared the niacin flush response in subjects from families with only one member affected with schizophrenia (simplex families) with those from families having a sib-pair with schizophrenia (multiplex families). Subjects were patients with schizophrenia and their nonpsychotic first-degree relatives from simplex families (176 probands, 260 parents, and 80 siblings) and multiplex families (311 probands, 180 parents, and 52 siblings) as well as 94 healthy controls. Niacin patches of 3 concentrations (0.001M, 0.01M, and 0.1M) were applied to forearm skin, and the flush response was rated at 5, 10, and 15 minutes, respectively, with a 4-point scale. More attenuated flush response to topical niacin was shown in schizophrenia probands and their relatives from multiplex families than in their counterparts from simplex families, and the differentiation was better revealed using 0.1M concentration of niacin than 0.01M or 0.001M. For the highest concentration of 0.1M and the longest time lag of 15 minutes, a subgroup of probands (23%), parents (27%), and siblings (19%) still exhibited nonflush response. Flush response to niacin skin patch is more impaired in schizophrenia patients and their relatives from families with higher genetic loading for schizophrenia, and this finding has implications for future genetic dissection of schizophrenia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nicotinic acid</kwd><kwd>niacin skin test</kwd><kwd>prostaglandin</kwd><kwd>vulnerability indicator</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Niacin (nicotinic acid), both a vitamin and a drug for hyperlipidemia,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref> can induce a visible skin flush response that is caused by prostaglandin-mediated cutaneous vasodilatation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref> The observation of reduced flush response in patients with schizophrenia in early research on high-dose niacin treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref> had led to the proposal of niacin challenge as a simple biochemical test for this illness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref> Studies utilizing oral niacin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref> or topical skin patch of methyl nicotinate (a skin-permeable ester of nicotinic acid)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref> consistently found attenuated flush response in patients with schizophrenia.

The utility of this strategy has been demonstrated in detecting the association of higher genetic loading with more severe neuropsychological deficits, which are potential markers for genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia, in nonpsychotic relatives of schizophrenia patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></p><p>In this study, we aimed to compare the niacin flush response of schizophrenia patients and their relatives with that of healthy controls and to examine the effect of genetic loading, assuming that subjects from families having a sib-pair with schizophrenia (multiplex families) have higher genetic loading for schizophrenia than those from families without positive history in first-degree relatives other than the proband (simplex families). We predicted that the skin response to niacin would be abnormal in patients with schizophrenia and their relatives and that the abnormalities would be more prominent in subjects from multiplex families than in their counterparts from simplex families.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The present study recruited probands of simplex and multiplex families as well as their nonpsychotic relatives from 2 studies on schizophrenia. The first study recruited specifically probands of simplex families from inpatient or outpatient units at the Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, and Ju Shan Hospital, a private psychiatric hospital in Taoyuan County, if they met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, depressive type. Any family having 2 coaffected siblings was not included for the study. Part of the recruited subjects (153 probands, 217 nonpsychotic parents, and 70 nonpsychotic siblings) had participated in our previous study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref> However, among them 2 families were found to have one parent affected with schizophrenia and were thus excluded from the subsequent analyses. Further, any subject with mental retardation, dementia, or prominent substance use problem was excluded, too. For the final analysis, subjects from simplex families included 176 schizophrenia probands, 260 unaffected parents, and 80 unaffected siblings. Whether probands or their first-degree relatives had schizophrenia was determined by means of face-to-face interview or information provided by directly interviewed relatives on those who were not interviewed personally, and, among a total of 849 alive first-degree relatives from simplex families, 420 (49.5%) were directly interviewed.</p><p>Subjects from multiplex families constituted a subgroup of participants in a second study, the Taiwan Schizophrenia Linkage Study (TSLS), which has been described in detail elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref> In brief, the TSLS was aimed at collecting a large nation-wide sample of schizophrenia families with at least 2 siblings fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, and successfully recruited 607 families, comprising 2490 subjects (1258 probands, 922 parents, and 310 unaffected siblings). The initial research protocol of the TSLS did not include niacin skin patch test until the last year of the project, and thus only 633 out of 2490 (25.4%) subjects (350 probands, 223 parents, and 60 unaffected siblings) were assessed with the skin test. The subjects who undertook niacin skin test and those who did not, regardless of probands, parents, or siblings, were comparable in terms of age, gender ratio, and years of education (all <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; .05). For probands, there was no difference in age at onset between those who were assessed with niacin skin test and those who were not (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; .05). After excluding those with mental retardation, dementia, or prominent substance use problem, the final study subjects from multiplex families consisted of 311 schizophrenia probands, 180 unaffected parents, and 52 unaffected siblings.</p><p>Healthy volunteers were recruited from members of the hospital staff of National Taiwan University Hospital who reported a negative history of any psychiatric disorder and constituted the control group. All participants in this study, regardless of the multiplex, simplex, or control group, were Taiwanese Han Chinese in ethnic origin and had to meet the following criteria before undertaking niacin skin patch test: no history of alcohol and drug abuse, no pregnancy, no major systemic illness (especially heart disease, allergic skin illness, and asthma), and no usage of anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroids) within 3 days before the niacin skin test. Subjects were included in the study after they had given written informed consent to participate, and the study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Diagnostic Procedures</title><p>For both simplex and multiplex groups, all the schizophrenia probands and their first-degree relatives were interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref> Interrater reliability of the Chinese version of the DIGS for the diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression was reported to be good, with the kappa values ranging from 0.86 to 0.93.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref> The Chinese version of the Family Interview for Genetic Studies (FIGS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref> was used by the interviewers to obtain relevant family history information on those relatives who were not directly interviewed for the study. Interviewers were research assistants who had received rigorous training on the Chinese version of the DIGS and the FIGS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref> Best-estimate final diagnosis according to the DSM-IV criteria was made independently by 2 board-certified psychiatrists using all available information, including the DIGS, the FIGS, the hospital records, and the interviewers' notes. When the 2 diagnostians disagreed, a senior research psychiatrist (H-G.H.) would be sought and a consensus in diagnosis was reached after discussion.</p><p>All of the probands from both the multiplex and simplex groups received the final diagnosis of schizophrenia except 2 probands from multiplex families who were diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder, depressive type. These 2 subjects and their relatives were included in the following analyses because the study results remained unchanged after excluding them. In addition, the DIGS contains a section of the modified Structured Interview for Schizotypy (SIS),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref> which measures both schizotypal symptoms and signs. Information obtained by the SIS was used to diagnose DSM-IV schizotypal, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorders in nonpsychotic relatives.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref> Among siblings from simplex families, 0 (0%), 0 (0%), and 1 (1.3%) subject was diagnosed as having schizotypal, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorders, respectively, and the corresponding figures among parents from simplex families were 0 (0%), 4 (1.5%), and 1 (0.4%). The study results remained unchanged when we treated those with these personality disorders as affected cases and accordingly reassigned their families to the multiplex group (for an affected sibling) or excluded these families from the subsequent analyses (for an affected parent).</p></sec><sec><title>Niacin Skin Test</title><p>We used a modified protocol that was based on Ward et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref> In the form of aqueous methyl nicotinate (AMN), one drop of 0.001M, 0.01M, or 0.1M niacin solution was put onto 3 patches of absorbent paper, respectively. The concentration of 0.0001M evoked nearly no flush response even in the healthy controls and thus was not used in this study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref> Using adhesive tapes, the 3 AMN patches, as well as a blank one for negative control use, were applied to each subject's forearm skin for 5 minutes and then removed. The following criteria with a 4-point scale was used to rate the skin flush reaction at 5, 10, and 15 minutes after application of the patches: 0 = no erythema, 1 = incomplete erythema, 2 = complete erythema within the definite area of the patch, and 3 = erythema plus edema beyond the definite area of the patch. Focusing on lack of flush, we also treated the scoring as binary using the cut-off point of 2 and categorized score 0 or 1 as nonflush response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></p><p>In a preliminary study of 50 subjects (34 patients with schizophrenia, 4 patients with bipolar disorder, and 12 healthy controls), the interrater reliability for the flush scoring by 2 psychiatrists (S-S.C. and C-M.L.) was shown to be good with the intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.85 to 0.94 for different concentrations of AMN.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref> Five research assistants trained by the 2 psychiatrists then assessed flush response for all subjects in this study. In another preliminary evaluation of 50 subjects (25 patients with schizophrenia and 25 healthy controls), the interrater reliability of the 5 research assistants was good, with the intraclass correlation coefficients for the 3 different concentrations of AMN being 0.76 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.84), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.83), and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.79), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Group comparisons in demographic features were conducted using Student's <italic>t</italic> test for continuous variables and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> or Fisher's exact test (when the cell number was less than 5) for categorical variables. Because familial aggregation in niacin flush response had been demonstrated in our prior work,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref> a linear mixed-effects model that allows for adjustment for intrafamilial correlation was adopted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref> This model could also properly account for correlation between repeated measurements on the same subject,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref> which, in the present study, included 9 flush scores rated at 3 time points (5, 10, and 15 minutes) for 3 concentrations of AMN (0.1M, 0.01M, and 0.001M). Therefore, family, time, and concentration were treated as random effects in the mixed-effects model if indicated, and SAS PROC MIXED (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for the analyses.</p><p>For each of the comparisons between healthy controls and probands, parents, or siblings, a multivariate linear mixed-effects modeling analysis was conducted to examine the overall effects of group (multiplex, simplex, and control), concentration, time, interactions (among group, concentration, and time), and other covariates (age, gender, cigarette smoking, coffee drinking, and history of food or drug allergy). A <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was considered significant. If a 2-way interaction term involving group was significant, group differences with respect to individual levels of the other variable (ie, concentration or time) were examined using either generalized linear modeling or mixed-effects modeling analyses, as indicated, after adjustment for other covariates. The nominal value of significance was adjusted accordingly (<italic>P</italic> value of less than .006, ie, .05 divided by 9). For any significant group effect, post hoc pairwise comparisons among the 3 groups were conducted with Bonferroni correction. Effect sizes in niacin flush scores were calculated by subtracting the mean values between the groups of interest and then divided by the pooled SD, representing group differences in SDs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sample Characteristics</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> summarizes the demographic features of all study subjects.

For each of the comparisons among healthy controls and the multiplex and simplex groups of probands, parents, or siblings, respectively, 3-way group-concentration-time interaction was insignificant and thus dropped from subsequent analyses. Significant overall effects were demonstrated for group, concentration, time, and their pairwise 2-way interactions, whereas the effects of other covariates were mostly not significant except for gender and cigarette smoking when comparing parents with healthy controls. Significant concentration-by-time interaction indicated that the increase of skin flushing over time depended on applied AMN concentration. Further, group-by-concentration and group-by-time interactions indicated that the effect of genetic loading on niacin flush response differed by applied AMN concentration and observation time.

When multiplex families were compared with healthy controls, subjects from multiplex families had less skin flushing for both 0.01M and 0.1M, particularly at 10 and 15 minutes, with relatively large effect sizes for these 2 time lags (1.0&#x02013;1.3 for probands, 1.0&#x02013;1.4 for parents, and 0.6&#x02013;1.0 for siblings).</p><p>Of note, for the setting in which the maximal flush response was expected in the present study, ie, 15 minutes following the application of 0.1M AMN skin patch, a substantial proportion of probands (23%), parents (27%), and siblings (19%) from multiplex families still exhibited nonflush response, whereas complete erythematous response could be seen in all of the healthy controls and nearly all but 2%&#x02013;5% of the subjects from simplex families.

The results revealed impaired niacin flush response in schizophrenia patients and their relatives and that the impairment was more pronounced in probands, parents, and siblings from families with higher genetic loading for schizophrenia (multiplex families) than in their counterparts from families with lower loading (simplex families). Furthermore, the optimal concentration of niacin for distinguishing between multiplex and simplex families was 0.1M, when a subgroup of subjects from multiplex families still displayed little response to the strongest niacin stimulation for this study.</p><p>The present study found significant differences by means of collecting a sample size with adequate power to discriminate between subjects with different genetic loading for schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref> and adopting strategies to address methodological concerns such as personal interviews or obtaining family history information using validated tool for diagnosing relatives and controlling for potential confounders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref> In contrast, one previous study compared flush response to oral niacin between schizophrenia patients with positive family history and those without,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref> and the insignificant result in that study could be attributed to insufficient power (33 schizophrenia patients in total) and other methodological problems related to subtyping schizophrenia using family history.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></p><p>An important feature of this study is that a wide range of AMN concentrations and time lags were examined. The finding that group differences varied with different concentration-time combinations is worthy of discussion. First, schizophrenia probands and their relatives from multiplex families consistently showed less skin flushing than their counterparts from simplex families and healthy controls for 0.1M. Furthermore, a significant proportion of subjects from multiplex families still presented with little skin flushing in the setting the maximal response was expected. Second, subjects from simplex families tended to show less skin flushing than healthy controls for 0.01M, with significant difference across time found between healthy controls and probands but not their relatives. However, simplex families did not differ from healthy controls for 0.1M, and this could be due to the ceiling of skin flush response in both groups for this concentration. Therefore, simplex families differed from healthy controls in the distributions of flush response, instead of the maximal response, and this finding was consistent with a previous study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref> Third, the AMN concentrations of 0.1M and 0.01M characterized the group differences in niacin flush response better than 0.001M, and this finding was consistent with our previous report that flush scores data obtained using 0.1M and 0.01M yielded the greatest estimated heritability and recurrence risk ratios.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref> Thus, stimulation using 0.1M and 0.01M of AMN would provide more variations in skin flush response, whereas 0.001M could not evoke meaningful flushing among subjects. These findings imply that future genetic studies in schizophrenia should use niacin stimulation with these 2 concentrations of 0.1M and 0.01M to better discriminate between subjects' flush response.</p><p>Another feature of this study is that many potential confounders were controlled for in the analyses. Unlike the reported influence of age and gender on the flush response to niacin skin patch in one previous study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref> we found that the effects of age, coffee drinking, and history of allergy were not significant, a finding consistent with several studies on niacin skin test,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref> and that the effects of gender and cigarette smoking were significant only when comparing parents with healthy controls. Nevertheless, our finding of the genetic loading effect on niacin flush response was robust after accounting for these covariates.</p><p>Whether to include those disorders thought to be genetically linked to schizophrenia such as schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid personality disorders in the definition of family type might influence the study results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref> This influence was assessed in this study by regrouping or excluding those simplex families having a sibling or a parent diagnosed with these personality disorders, respectively, and the main results remained unchanged.</p><p>Our findings have important implications on the use of niacin skin patch test in genetic studies of schizophrenia. First, our results, together with our previous finding of family aggregation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref> suggest that abnormal flush response to niacin may be an endophenotype for schizophrenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref> The finding that only a subgroup but not all of the patients showed abnormal skin flushing implies that impaired niacin flush response might be an endophenotype rather than a diagnostic marker for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia patients and their relatives who presented with deficits in niacin flush response might share some specific pathophysiological characteristics or genotypes responsible for vulnerability to schizophrenia and thus could be an etiologically homogenous group for genetic linkage or association study. However, further studies are needed to examine whether the abnormal niacin flush response is independent of disease states and associated with certain candidate genes or gene regions of schizophrenia. In addition, the use of niacin flush response as an endophenotype may also be applied in imaging, cognition, or treatment studies on schizophrenia. For example, a recent study reported the association of peripheral niacin flush response with central metabolism by showing negative correlation between skin flushing and the levels of cerebral energy metabolism measured by 31-phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy in male schizophrenia patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></p><p>Second, a further understanding of the biochemical processes underlying the abnormal niacin flush response and related genetic regulations may lead to new directions for etiological research of schizophrenia. Because the niacin flush response has been demonstrated to be mediated by prostaglandin, particularly prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref> the underlying mechanism of the abnormal skin response to niacin might involve any step in the process of prostaglandin signaling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref> Prostaglandins are derived from metabolism of membrane lipids, and disturbed lipids metabolism in both central and peripheral tissues was repeatedly shown in schizophrenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref> One previous study had shown the usefulness of niacin skin test in identifying a gene polymorphism related to a key enzyme in lipids metabolism and further used this marker in genetic association study on schizophrenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></p><p>Finally, the niacin skin test may be used as a research tool to test new etiological hypotheses of schizophrenia with an emphasis on the inflammatory process. For example, a novel theory of schizophrenia has reviewed the evidence that inflammatory vascular disease of the brain can lead to psychosis and hypothesized schizophrenia as a genetically mediated central nervous system microvascular inflammation disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref> Because the impairment in flush response to niacin might be one peripheral marker of a centrally as well as systemically disturbed inflammatory process, the niacin skin test might be used as a screening tool for abnormal inflammatory reaction and related aberrant genetic regulations.</p><p>The study has several limitations. First, a mean age of 32 years in siblings from simplex families in our sample implied that some of them had not passed through the age of risk and this might lead to misclassification of family type. Second, we directly interviewed only half of alive first-degree relatives from simplex families, and, for those who were not directly interviewed, a failure to diagnose schizophrenia in affected relatives might cause misclassification of family type, too. Nevertheless, we used a validated tool on collecting family history information to reduce false negatives. Furthermore, above misclassifications tended to categorize multiplex case as simplex one and thus would diminish rather than increase differences in niacin flush response between the 2 groups. Third, most of the patients with schizophrenia in this study were receiving medication treatment, and this might influence our results because some studies have reported alteration of flush response to niacin by antipsychotic treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref> However, most of the previous studies found that medication status did not influence niacin flush response,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref> and our findings in nonpsychotic relatives in addition to probands further suggested niacin flush response as a genetic trait independent of medication or disease status.</p><p>In summary, impaired flush response to topical niacin was associated with genetic loading for schizophrenia, indicated by more blunted skin response in probands, parents, and siblings from multiplex families than their counterparts from simplex families. In 3-by-3 combinations of niacin concentration and time lag, the differentiation between subjects with different genetic loading was better revealed using 0.1M concentration of niacin skin patch than 0.01M or 0.001M. Heterogeneity is indicated by the finding that a subgroup of patients and their relatives from multiplex families still displayed blunted skin response in the setting when subjects from simplex families or healthy controls exhibited complete erythema. Our findings support that abnormal niacin-induced skin flush response is a vulnerability trait for schizophrenia and might be useful in future genetic dissection of schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/sbm153/DC1">Supplementary figures 1 and 2</ext-link> are available online at http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>US National Institute of Mental Health (1R01-MH-59624-01); National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan (NHRI-90-8825PP, NHRI-EX91, 92-9113PP, NHRI-CN-MG-9006S, NHRI-EX93-9113PP); National Science Council, Taiwan (NSC-91-3112-B-002-011, NSC-92-3112-B-002-019, NSC-93-3112-B-002-012); National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH-90S1562).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="sbm153_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="sbm153_szbltn-orirep-07-0224-File003_sbm153.tif"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="sbm153_szbltn-orirep-07-0224-File004_sbm153.tif"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the administrative authority of the TSLS group for their support including National Taoyuan, Chaotun, Yu-Li Psychiatric Center, National Cheng-Kung University Hospital, Kaohsiung Kai-Suan Psychiatric Hospital, Yu-Li Veteran Hospital, and Taipei City Psychiatric Center.
