All of these steps require the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we found that the protein palladin, a molecular scaffold with an important function in actin organization, is expressed at higher overall levels in tumors compared to benign breast tissue, and also significantly higher in four invasive breast cancer cell lines when compared to four non-invasive cell lines. In addition, we found that palladin plays a key role in the formation of podosomes. Podosomes are actin-rich structures that function in adhesion and matrix degradation and have been found in many invasive cell types. Our results show that phorbol ester treatment stimulated the formation of palladin-containing podosomes in invasive, but not in non-invasive cell lines. More importantly, palladin knockdown resulted in decreased podosome formation and a significant reduction in transwell migration and invasive motility. Palladin overexpression induced podosome formation in the non-invasive MCF7 cells, which are otherwise unable to form podosomes, suggesting that palladin plays a critical role in the assembly of podosomes.

The spread of cancer cells to distant sites in the body is the major cause of death in breast cancer patients, rather than the primary tumors themselves. In order for cells to metastasize, they must first become detached from neighboring cells, then acquire a motile phenotype, and finally, gain the ability to invade through the extracellular matrix to permit both intravasation and extravasation. Each of these steps involves the dynamic reorganization of specific types of actin arrays. Thus, it is not surprising that many different regulators of the actin cytoskeleton have been implicated in the process of metastasis; examples include cofilin, Arp 2/3, LASP-1, Mena, AFAP-110 and profilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Di Modugno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Grunewald et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Roy and Jacobson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wittenmayer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Yamaguchi and Condeelis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Palladin is an actin-associated protein that plays an essential role in the assembly and maintenance of multiple types of actin-dependent structures, including both contractile stress fibers in fibroblasts and dynamic dorsal ruffles and podosomes in vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Goicoechea et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Parast and Otey, 2000</xref>). Palladin was first shown to play a role in protrusive motility in knockdown experiments with cultured cells, in which palladin expression was found to be required for normal neurite extension in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Boukhelifa et al., 2001</xref>). More recently, the phenotype of the palladin null mouse (embryonic lethal, with defects in body wall closure both dorsally and ventrally) demonstrated that palladin plays an essential role in normal cell motility during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Luo et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Since palladin is required for normal cell motility during embryonic development, this raises the possibility that palladin could also be involved in the pathological cell motility that is characteristic of metastatic cancer cells, and multiple lines of evidence support this idea. In an analysis of pancreatic and colorectal cancers, palladin was found within a cluster of invasion-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Ryu et al., 2001</xref>). More recently, the Condeelis lab found that the human palladin gene was strongly upregulated (&#x0223c;3 fold) in aggressively motile cells, as compared to the nonmotile cells in the primary tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, a mutation in the human palladin gene was recently implicated in an unusual and highly penetrant form of familial pancreatic cancer, which is an extremely invasive disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Pogue-Geile et al., 2006</xref>). Together, these results suggest that palladin could play a key role in the abnormal behavior of metastatic cancer cells. However, these results are essentially correlative in nature, and the precise mechanism by which palladin contributes to invasive cancer is not known.</p><p id="P5">The most common localization of palladin is in regularly-spaced puncta along stress fibers of well-spread cells; however, palladin have also been shown to localize to dorsal ruffles, cell-cell junctions and podosomes. Recent advances in the cell motility field have shown that many types of invasive cells form podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Calle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Yamaguchi et al., 2006</xref>). Podosomes are highly dynamic structures involved in the adhesion of cells to solid substrates, and they also play a role in tissue invasion and matrix remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Buccione et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Gimona and Buccione, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Linder, 2007</xref>). Podosomes were originally discovered in monocyte-derived cells, but they have recently been observed in other cell types that migrate across tissue boundaries as part of their physiological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Carman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Gringel et al., 2006</xref>). It has been demonstrated that treatment of cells with phorbol esters such as phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) induces the formation of podosomes and also triggers partial disassembly of actin stress fibers. The podosomes induced by PDBu treatment possess the standard podosome features, containing an F-actin core surrounded by a ring of adhesion proteins such as vinculin and talin, and exhibiting a tubular, column-like morphology arising perpendicularly from the bottom of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Gimona et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Hai et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p id="P6">In this study, we found that palladin levels in breast cancer patients is higher in malignant tissues that in normal breast samples. In addition, highly invasive breast cancer cell lines express significantly higher levels of palladin than non-invasive cell types. Our results also show that the expression level of palladin is correlated with their ability to form podosomes and that knocking down palladin resulted in a decrease in their ability to form PDBu-induced podosomes, as well as in reduced migration and invasion. These results suggest that palladin plays an important role in promoting podosome formation, and thus high levels of palladin expression may contribute to the invasive motility of metastatic breast cancer cells by facilitating the assembly of these matrix-degrading structures. However, our results also show that overexpression of palladin alone is not sufficient to trigger enhanced invasive motility in cultured human breast cancer cells. Overall, these results support a model in which a cohort of genes is coordinately upregulated in metastatic cells, each contributing to specific aspects of invasive cell motility and cell survival.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Palladin protein levels correlate with metastatic potential in human breast cancer</title><p id="P7">Previous microarrays results showed that overexpression of palladin correlates with invasive motility in human breast cancer cells implanted in a mouse host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). To further explore palladin's function in breast cancer, immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded sections of breast tissue. Histological sections of normal breast tissues (<italic>n</italic> = 5), primary tumors (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and metastasis (<italic>n</italic> = 5) were stained with palladin antibody, and representative images of each group are shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>. In normal breast, palladin was detected in ductal epithelial cells and also in occasional blood vessels (not shown). In primary tumors, palladin was detected in the neoplastic cells. Palladin staining was significantly stronger in metastatic tumors. Since metastases are derived from a highly invasive subset of cells in the original tumor, this result is consistent with the idea that palladin overexpression contributes to invasive cell motility. However, immunohistochemistry is only semi-quantitative, so we also investigated palladin levels in patient samples using immunoblot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>, palladin levels were significantly higher overall in primary tumors, as compared to normal breast tissue, although there was variation from sample to sample which may reflect the varying amount of tumor versus normal cells in each sample, or differences in the biologic behavior of these primary tumors. Palladin levels were also high in the three samples of metastatic disease, although these were also variable within this small sample size. To assure approximately equal sample loading in each lane, the blots were also analyzed for GADPH (a standard house-keeping protein) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that deregulated palladin expression may be a common feature of invasive cancer. However, both our results obtained with patient samples and the previously published microassay results demonstrate only a correlation and do not directly demonstrate a role for palladin in invasive cell motility. Therefore, we turned to a cultured cell model system to explore palladin's cellular function in more detail.</p><p id="P8">The expression of palladin in breast cancer cell lines was examined by immunoblot analysis using total cell lysates <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>. For these experiments, we utilized eight lines of human breast cancer cells. These cell lines are well characterized, and their invasive potentials have been established: T47D, BT474, ZR75.1 and MCF-7 cells are non-invasive, while BT549, Hs578T, MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 are invasive in nude mice and also invasively motile <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Flanagan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kuperwasser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Zajchowski et al., 2001</xref>). The expression levels of palladin were normalized against those of tubulin and the results are presented in arbitrary units and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>. Among the breast cancer cell lines, high levels (approximately 80 arbitrary units) of palladin were detected in the highly invasive BT549, Hs578, MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, whereas very low levels (approximately 5 arbitrary units) were detected in the non-invasive T47D, BT474, ZR75.1 and MCF7 cells. The correlation of palladin expression level with the metastatic potential/invasiveness of breast cancer cells suggests that palladin may be part of the mechanism governing the migratory and invasiveness of breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Invasive breast cancer cells form podosomes in response to PBDu treatment</title><p id="P9">The presence of podosomes correlates with invasiveness in a variety of human cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bowden et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kelly et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Monsky et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Seals et al., 2005</xref>). Podosomes are believed to facilitate migration across basement membranes through the activity of membrane-bound proteases that digest the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Linder and Aepfelbacher, 2003</xref>). We examined the ability of both non-invasive and invasive breast cancer cells to form podosomes in response to phorbol ester stimulation. MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells were treated with two phorbol esters, PBDu and PMA, fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. Podosomes, identified by their dot-like concentrations of F-actin, were found both individually and in clusters scattered over the ventral membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). <italic>Z</italic>-series analyses of individual podosome structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>, insets) shows that the adhesion protein vinculin, which is an intrinsic component of podosomes, closely surrounds the actin core (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that podosome formation was detected only in the invasive cell lines MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells shortly after addition or either PDBu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) or PMA (not shown), but not in the non-invasive MCF7 cells, which have very low levels of endogenous palladin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Palladin localizes to podosomes and enhances podosome formation</title><p id="P10">Palladin has been shown previously to play an essential role in podosome formation in vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Goicoechea et al., 2006</xref>). We hypothesized that the high levels of palladin expression in MDA-MB-231 and SUM 159 cells could facilitate the formation of podosomes in these invasive breast cancer cells. To determine if palladin is recruited to these actin-based structures, immunostaining was used to visualize endogenous palladin in invasive MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells after stimulation with PDBu. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> shows that palladin was clearly enriched in the podosomes and co-localized with actin in cells double-labeled for palladin and F-actin.</p><p id="P11">To determine the role of palladin in PDBu induction of podosomes, we examined the effect of palladin knockdown on the cellular response to PDBu. siRNA oligos were used to knock down the expression of palladin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref> shows that when palladin siRNA transfected cells were treated with PDBu, a significant percentage of the siRNA-transfected cells were unable to form podosomes. When these results were quantified, we found that palladin knockdown reduces the percentage of cells that form podosomes from 36% to 19% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). These results suggest that palladin plays an important role in increasing the efficiency of podosome formation induced by PDBu.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Palladin knockdown in SUM159 cells impairs cell migration and invasion</title><p id="P12">We found that palladin is overexpressed in highly invasive SUM159 cells compared with the non-invasive cell line MCF7. This finding, together with the previous demonstration that palladin is localized to dynamic structures such as dorsal ruffles and podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Goicoechea et al., 2006</xref>) prompted us to investigate the role of palladin in SUM159 cell migration and invasion using serum as a chemo-attractant. SUM159 cells were transfected with siRNAs and 96 h later, were collected and placed in the upper half of the inserts, which were then incubated for 24 h. Western blot analysis shows that treatment with palladin siRNA leads to a &#x0223c;90% reduction in palladin expression in SUM 159 cells (KD), as compared to cells treated with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Representative photomicrographs illustrate that SUM159 cells transfected with control siRNA migrate and invade faster compared with cells transfected with palladin siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-C</xref>). Following the quantification of stained cells, the percentage of migration and invasion was calculated by normalization of the number of knockdown cells, to the number of control cells that moved through the filters showing that palladin knockdown reduces both, the percentage of cells that migrate through the membrane by 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) and the percentage of cells that invade through the Matrigel by 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, MCF-7 cells neither migrated nor invaded through the filters, either with or without palladin siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B-C</xref>). These results suggest that palladin plays an important role in cell migration and invasion.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Palladin overexpression in MCF7 cells induces podosome formation</title><p id="P13">We have shown so far that palladin knockdown results in decreased podosome formation, and in a significant reduction in the efficiency of transwell migration and invasive motility of SUM159 cells which express high levels of palladin. We also have shown that in the absence of exogenous palladin, MCF7 cells (which have low endogenous levels of palladin) do not form podosomes at all. Next, we wanted to determine whether experimental overexpression palladin was sufficient to drive PDB&#x003bc;-induced formation of podosomes. We infected MCF7 cells with an adenovirus vector encoding either GFP (control) or myc-palladin (OE). We overexpressed palladin to levels that are comparable with those found in invasive cells such as Hs578, MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Double immunostaining was used to visualize myc-palladin and actin in MCF7 cells after stimulation with PDBu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). When cells were infected with adenovirus vector encoding myc-palladin, podosome formation was observed in 10% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Because palladin expression levels correlate with the invasiveness of breast cancer cells, we also examined whether palladin overexpression could promote cell migration and/or cell invasion in non-invasive MCF7 cells, or enhance the invasion of SUM159 cells.

Consistently with the results showed above, MCF7 cell did not migrate or invade either with or without overexpressed palladin levels. Together, these results suggest that palladin plays an important role in podosome formation but is not sufficient to promote cell migration and invasion.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S8"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P15">Palladin's function has been explored previously in multiple types of cultured cells and also in knockout mice (Goicoechea et al., In Press). These studies have shown that palladin expression correlates closely with cell motility: palladin protein is more abundant in embryonic tissues (which are highly plastic) than in adult mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Parast and Otey, 2000</xref>), and in many adult organs, palladin is upregulated after injury near the wound-site, where cell migration and tissue remodeling occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Boukhelifa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Jin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Ronty et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that in normal cells, palladin expression is tightly controlled to allow for regulated transitions from non-motile to motile phenotypes. The present study was directed at understanding the potential role of palladin in a pathological type of cell migration, the invasive motility that characterizes malignant breast cancer cells. The role of palladin in breast cancer metastasis has not been investigated previously; however, multiple lines of evidence suggest that palladin could be critically involved in this process. First, palladin is a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. Palladin has been shown previously to be required for the maintenance of a normal actin cytoskeleton in a wide variety of cells (Goicoechea et al, In Press). Recently, a palladin knockout mouse was generated, and fibroblasts from this mouse displayed defects in cell motility, cell adhesion and actin organization, demonstrating that normal palladin levels are required for normal actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Luo et al., 2005</xref>). Second, palladin has been implicated in other highly invasive cancers. The human palladin gene is point-mutated in an inherited form of pancreatic cancer and also overexpressed in many cases of sporadic pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Pogue-Geile et al., 2006</xref>). Pancreatic cancer is lethal in 95-99% of cases, due to the extremely aggressive invasive motility of pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting the idea that deregulated palladin may contribute to this pathological cell behavior. Third, palladin is overexpressed in the most invasive population of cancer cells, as demonstrated by the results of two independent gene expression studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Ryu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). This correlation spurred us to test directly the hypothesis that high levels of palladin expression contribute to invasive motility.</p><p id="P16">Our results showed that palladin levels are much higher in more invasive than in noninvasive breast cancer cells: the most highly invasive breast cancer cell lines express palladin at levels that are approximately eighty times of those expressed by the majority of weakly invasive breast cancer cells. As the invasiveness of cancer cells is dependent on increased migratory and invasive properties, we have tested the hypothesis that the mechanism of action of palladin overexpression in breast cancers and cell lines is to promote the migration and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Both gain of function (by overexpression) and loss of function (by siRNA-mediated knockdown) established a critical role of palladin in the formation of podosomes by human breast cancer cells. Overexpression of palladin promotes podosome formation but has no effect on cell migration. These results are in accordance with Wang et al, who proposed that it is the activity of a pathway as a whole and not the change in expression of any one particular gene that determines the invasive and metastatic phenotype of the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P17">The question remains: how exactly does palladin contribute to these processes? We have recently shown that palladin binds to actin and that it plays a role as an actin-crosslinking protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dixon et al., 2008</xref>) leading us to the hypothesis that palladin may be involved in migration and invasion by organizing the actin networks at sites of protrusion, by crosslinking actin filaments into bundles. Many results obtained to date suggest that palladin also acts as a potent molecular scaffold with a critical role in organizing actin filaments into functional arrays. Palladin binds to a large number of actin-associated proteins, including ezrin, VASP/Mena/EVL, profilin, alpha-actinin, Lasp-1 and Eps8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Boukhelifa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Boukhelifa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Goicoechea et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Mykkanen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Rachlin and Otey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ronty et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, palladin binds to signaling intermediaries such as ArgBP-2 and SPIN-90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ronty et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Ronty et al., 2005</xref>), and palladin expression is required for the actin-cytoskeleton rearrangements that occur downstream of active Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Ronty et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that palladin regulates the organization of the actin cytoskeleton via multiple molecular pathways.</p><p id="P18">It has been proposed that genes encoding many components of the pathways that cause migration, including both stimulatory and inhibitory parts of each pathway, are coordinately upregulated in invading cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). It is worth noting that many of palladin's binding partners have been shown to be upregulated in invasive cancers. For example, Lasp-1 has been implicated in the motility of ovarian cancer and breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Grunewald et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Grunewald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Grunewald et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Lin et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, palladin binds to alpha-actinin, a widely expressed actin-crosslinking protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Ronty et al., 2004</xref>) that is also overexpressed in metastatic sub-populations of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hatakeyama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Honda et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Suehara et al., 2006</xref>). Eps8 is increased in pancreatic cancer, and its expression is required for dynamic actin-based cell protrusions and intercellular cytoskeletal organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Welsch et al., 2007</xref>). The strong binding interaction between palladin and its binding partners, and their high degree of co-localization in cells and tissues, suggest that these proteins may have a shared function in motility and adhesion that may be deregulated in cancer cells.</p><p id="P19">In conclusion, we provide insight into the role of palladin in cancer metastasis stemming from its important involvement in actin organization and cell motility. Future studies will evaluate the relationship between palladin expression and metastatic potential in animal models and cancer progression in breast cancer patients. Further studies are required to delineate whether palladin and/or any of its regulators represent novel targets for therapeutic interventions in human cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S9"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec id="S10"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P20">Eight breast cancer cell lines were used: T47D, BT474, ZR75.1, MCF7, BT549, Hs578, MDAMB-231 and SUM159.

Top two panels: Low magnification images of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 breast cancer cell lines. Bottom: High magnification image of SUM159 cells to show detail. <bold>C-</bold> SUM159 cells transfected with control siRNA oligos and siRNA oligos targeting palladin were plated on FBS-coated coverslips overnight and then treated with PDBu for 20 minutes. Left panel- Western blot analysis was used to detect palladin levels in cells treated with control oligos (C) or palladin- specific siRNA oligos (KD). RNA interference reduced expression by &#x0223c;90%. Right panel- Podosome formation was significantly reduced in palladin knockdown cell (KD, 19 &#x000b1; 5 %), as compared with control cells (C, 36 &#x000b1; 3 %). Results are representative of three independent experiments in which at least 300 transfected cells were counted.
