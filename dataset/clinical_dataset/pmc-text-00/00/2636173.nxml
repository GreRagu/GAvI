Wooden foreign bodies are notorious for remainingquiescent for a long time, before presenting with a variety ofcomplications. The wound of entry may often be small andself-sealing. Wooden foreign bodies also show a propensityto break during attempted removal. Intraorbital wood is oftennot detected by standard diagnostic tests like the computedtomography scan, adding to the diagnostic dilemma. Thepresence of an intraorbital mass with a discharging sinus shouldevoke suspicion of a retained organic foreign body, regardless ofthe time interval between the trauma and current presentation.

Foreign bodies of the orbit may give rise toa diverse range of clinical problems, which may be perplexingto the most experienced ophthalmologist. Wooden foreignbodies are notorious for remaining quiescent for a long time,before presenting with a variety of complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Cases havebeen reported in which the usual diagnostic techniques didnot detect intraorbital wood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> We report an unusualcase of a missed wooden intraorbital foreign body, which spontaneouslyextruded after five years.</p><sec sec-type=""><title>Case Report</title><p>A 19-year-old male presented to the casualty with a history ofinjury to his left eye by a palm leaf, which fell from a height ofabout 10 meters. A piece of the stalk had been removed from thewound at a local hospital earlier in the day. On examination, hisvision was 20/20, the globe was intact and ocular movementswere full. A superficial wound was noted at the left infraorbitalmargin. There was no evidence of residual foreign body. Thewound was dressed and the patient was asked to review in theoutpatient department.</p><p>The patient returned 18 months later with a swelling at thesame site. On examination, his vision was still 20/20. There wasa non-axial proptosis of the left eye with limitation of elevation.The globe was pushed 3 mm forwards and 2 mm upwards. A2 &#x000d7; 1 cm firm, non-tender mass was present at the infraorbitalmargin. The posterior extent of the mass could not be defined.There was a small scar on the skin over the mass. Computedtomography (CT) scan of the orbit obtained in axial and coronalplanes depicted a medium-sized soft tissue density mass inthe inferomedial aspect of the left orbit. The mass involved theretrobulbar, intra and extraconal spaces, abutting and slightlydisplacing the optic nerve superiorly [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1A">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1B">B</xref>].</p><p>An incision biopsy of the mass at the infraorbital marginwas done. Histopathological examination showed features ofchronic inflammation with fibroblastic proliferation [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2A">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2B">B</xref>]. As the results of the investigations did not suggest the presenceof a retained intraorbital foreign body, we considered otherpossible diagnoses like tuberculosis, sarcoidosis and idiopathicorbital inflammation. However, systemic examination did notreveal any clinical evidence of tuberculosis or sarcoidosis.Complete blood count, ESR, Mantoux test and Chest X-ray werewithin normal limits. As the patient was not very symptomaticat the time, we decided to keep him under observation for sometime. However, he was lost to follow-up again.</p><p>He presented two years later with a discharging sinus atthe site. At this point, we strongly suspected the presence ofa residual foreign body and advised a magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) scan of the orbit. The patient, however, deferredthe scan due to financial constraints. Meanwhile, the dischargefrom the sinus was sent for culture and sensitivity. It grew<italic>Enterobacter</italic> species, sensitive to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin,lomefloxacin and gentamicin. The patient was started onsystemic antibiotics (Tab. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily)and daily dressing of the sinus was continued. One weeklater, a foreign body, measuring 1.2 cm, was seen in the gauzewhen the dressing was removed. On follow-up, there was nofurther discharge from the sinus. So further active interventionwas deferred at that point and the patient was advised regularfollow-up. He defaulted again.</p><p>The patient came back to the hospital 18 months later. Hesaid that he had been having recurrent discharge from thesinus, which was being dressed at a local hospital. Anotherpiece of the wooden foreign body was seen on the gauze whenthe dressing was removed that day. He brought the specimenalong to show us. It measured 9 mm [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>]. On follow-up,the swelling resolved and the sinus healed completely. Hisvision was still 20/20. We repeated a CT scan of the orbit ayear later, which showed complete resolution of the mass[Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4A">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4B">B</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Discussion</title><p>The clinical course of orbital foreign bodies differs dependingon their composition. Most metallic foreign bodies remainquiescent for a long period of time without causing anyproblems. So the general recommendation is to leave themalone in the absence of specific indications for removal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>However, organic foreign bodies like wood have a muchhigher incidence of potentially sight-threatening and life-threatening complications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> They may remain dormant fora variable period of time and manifest with delayed-onsetorbital granuloma, cellulitis, abscess or chronic draining sinus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>Hence, surgical removal of organic intraorbital foreign bodiesis recommended.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p><p>In our case, a piece of the foreign body had been removedafter the initial trauma. When seen in our casualty on theevening of the same day, the wound looked superficial and therewas no clinical evidence of a residual foreign body. However,multiple pieces of wood were extruded over five years. It isimportant to remember that wooden foreign bodies oftenbreak during attempted removal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> The associated wound maybe small and self-sealing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Therefore, if there is recurrence ofclinical symptoms, especially, if there is a discharging sinus, thepossibility of a retained foreign body should be considered.</p><p>Imaging and prompt exploration of the sinus may helpin localizing and removing the foreign body. A CT scan isthe standard diagnostic test, because it demonstrates mostintraorbital foreign bodies and is safe in the presence of metallicforeign bodies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> In our case, however, the CT scan did not showany evidence of the foreign body. Review of previous reportssuggests that wood is often not detected on CT scan.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Computedtomographic imaging relies on the differing radiodensities oftissues for their differentiation. The radiodensity of wood isvariable and may be similar to that of the orbital tissues, whichmay account for the potential difficulty of recognition. TheCT appearances seem related to the interval between injuryand examination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> In the acute stage, the very low density ofwood can be confusing with low window settings, mimickingair bubbles. In the subacute stage, wood assumes a moderatedensity and may be difficult to distinguish from surroundingorbital fat. In the chronic stage, the density of wood can becomehigher than that of orbital muscle. It may be associated with aforeign-body reaction, which appears as a homogenous masssurrounding the dense wooden foreign body, with a densitysimilar to the adjacent extraocular muscles. Spiral CT scannershave improved resolution and faster speed of acquisition ofimages.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> The fast image capture allows the scanning to occurwith minimal motion artifact. In spite of these advantages,wooden intraocular foreign bodies could only be described as&#x02033;probable intraocular foreign bodies&#x02033; by neuroradiologists ina pilot study using a spiral CT scanner.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>The MRI scans are better at demonstrating wooden foreignbodies. Magnetic resonance imaging depends on the density ofprotons in the tissue and their different relaxation times. Theseproperties of wood are dissimilar enough from those of the softtissue to allow differentiation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Therefore, it is recommendedthat MRI scan should be performed after a negative CT scanif there is a possibility of a wooden intraorbital foreign body.An MRI scan may be performed as the primary imagingmodality if there is a definite history of a wooden intraorbitalforeign body.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p><p>Several aspects of this case are interesting. The long latentperiod between injury and development of the orbital massand sinus, the apparent removal of the foreign body from thewound after the initial trauma, the spontaneous extrusion ofpieces of the foreign body twice with an interval of 18 monthsand complete resolution of the orbital mass on CT scan aredistinctive features of this case. The entire sequence of eventsspanned over five years. This was partly due to the frequentdefaulting on the part of the patient.</p><p>In conclusion, we would like to emphasize that intraorbitalforeign bodies may often present a confusing clinical picture.It is important for the ophthalmologist, radiologist andpathologist to include foreign body granuloma among thedifferentials of an intraorbital mass. It is imperative to seekpast and recent history of trauma and maintain a high index ofsuspicion in all such cases, regardless of the interval betweenthe trauma and current presentation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Dr. Mary Jacob, MD, Professor, Department of Pathology, ChristianMedical College, Vellore for the histopathology report.</p></ack><ref-list><ref
