The samplesize was calculated taking a prevalence of ocular trauma as2.5%, a precision of 80%, confidence level of 95%, design effectof 1.5 and coverage of 85%. The sample size thus obtained was6148. The study area comprised three randomly selected urbanslums in Delhi, out of the ten at which primary eye care servicesare provided by our center. A map of each slum was preparedand the study explained to the local community leaders andhealth-related personnel. In each slum, the first 500 families weresequentially selected after a door-to-door survey. Visits wereusually conducted on Sundays to try and capture the maximumresidents of the household. In case a house was found locked, twofurther visits were paid to contact the household members.</p><p>An interview was arranged with any of the available adultmembers of the family, preferably, the head of the family. Theinformed consent form was read out in the local vernacularto the participants, and their signature or thumb impressionwas taken on the form. The socio-demographic informationabout each family was recorded. This included family size,family type, age, gender, occupation, workplace of all familymembers, monthly income, per capita income, and educationalstatus of participants aged more than seven years. History ofocular trauma was taken from all available adults while, forthose less than 15 years of age, the parents or guardians wereinterviewed about the same. Details of each episode of oculartrauma were recorded with respect to the age at which injuryoccurred, place and source of trauma, treatment sought andthe benefit of treatment. It was specifically asked if the traumahad been sustained during the last one month. This was tofacilitate estimation of the cumulative incidence of oculartrauma, as the recall during the preceding one month waslikely to be reliable.</p><p>Each member of the family, who sustained ocular trauma atany time in his/her lifetime requiring medical care, was offereda detailed ophthalmic examination. Visual acuity (Snellen&#x02032;s)was recorded, and refraction performed if pinhole vision in theinjured eye was &#x0003c;20/20 to arrive at the best corrected visual acuity(BCVA). The anterior segment was evaluated with diffuse light,slit-lamp (Haag Streit) and a Goldmann single mirror indirectgonioscope (Volk, USA). Posterior segment was evaluated usingdirect and indirect ophthalmoscope (Heine, Germany) with +20D lens. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured either with ahand-held applanation tonometer (Perkin&#x02032;s), or noted digitally.Visual fields were tested by confrontation method. Referral tothe base hospital was made as appropriate.</p><p>The data collected were suitably coded and entered intopre-designed Microsoft Access software. Data analysis wasdone with SPSS 11.0 Package.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 1500 families, 1437 (95.8%) could be contacted. A total of6704 participants were interviewed.
