This study was designed to survey the prevalence and risk factors for CKD in Korea. The 2,356 subjects were selected in proportion to age, gender, and city. Subjects 35 yr of age or older were selected from 7 cities. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation, with albuminuria defined as a urine albumin to creatinine ratio of 30 mg/g or more. The overall prevalence of CKD was 13.7%. The prevalences of CKD according to stage were 2.0% stage 1, 6.7% stage 2, 4.8% stage 3, 0.2% stage 4, and 0.0% stage 5. The prevalences of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria were 8.6% and 1.6%, respectively. The prevalence of eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> was 5.0%. Age, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and fasting blood glucose were independent factors related to the presence of CKD. In conclusions, Korea, in which the prevalence of CKD is increasing, should prepare a policy for early detection and appropriate treatment of CKD. The present data will be helpful in taking those actions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Korea</kwd><kwd>Kidney Failure, Chronic</kwd><kwd>Epidemiologic Studies</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide problem, and its prevalence is increasing dramatically. According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), the prevalence of CKD in the United States was 13.1% between 1999 and 2004, which indicated an increase compared to the 10.0% prevalence noted during the 1994-1998 period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the AusDiab kidney study, approximately 16% of Australian adults had markers of CKD, including proteinuria, hematuria, or reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The prevalence of CKD in Asia is not lower than that seen in Western countries. The prevalence of GFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in the adult Japanese population is 19.1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). A recent study found the prevalence of CKD in Beijing to be 13.0% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>CKD is a well known predictor of hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), cardiovascular mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), noncardiac mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Decreased renal function is also a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and poor quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Some CKD-related metabolic complications, such as anemia and hyperparathyroidism, are observed early in stage 3 CKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Despite the significant health problems associated with CKD, an English study showed that only 15.2% of patients with CKD were known to renal services and only 8.1% of patients were referred to a nephrologist during a mean follow-up period of 31.3 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Late referral to a nephrologist was an important risk factor for patient mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The cost of health services for patients with CKD is 1.8 times the cost for patients without CKD. By 2010, more than 28 billion US dollars will be paid for health services in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>In Korea, the prevalence and incidence of ESRD have been increasing since 1986, as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In 2005, the incidence of ESRD in Korea reached 173 per million population (PMP), and the prevalence reached 900 PMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). An international comparison of ESRD epidemiology showed Korea to rank 9th in ESRD prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The health costs for kidney disease (defined by ICD-10 codes N18.x and N19.x) made up 3.24% of the national expenditure for health services in Korea in 2004.</p><p>Although the data for patients with ESRD has been entered into the ESRD registry in the Korean Society of Nephrology since 1986, there have been no studies detailing the nationwide prevalence of CKD in Korea. Thus, this cross-sectional epidemiologic study was designed to survey the prevalence and risk factors for CKD in the 7 major cities of Korea.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>This was a cross-sectional epidemiologic study. The sample population was made up of individuals 35 yr or older, selected in proportion to age, gender, and city in Korea. We decided to include 2,400 persons in the study. Seven cities were included (Seoul, Incheon, Daejeon, Gwangju, Daegu, Ulsan, Busan); 48.03% of Koreans age 35 yr or older live in these cities according to the 2006 Korean Population Census. Seoul and Incheon are located in the middle of the Korean peninsula; Daejeon and Gwangju are in the southwest; and Ulsan, Daegu, and Busan are in the southeast. A website was created, and an advertisement was placed in various newspapers for volunteers to participate in this survey. The number of participants was decided according to age, gender, and sub-district of city (Gu). Only one person per household could participate in this survey. The website for volunteers was closed after the planned number of participants was recruited. There were 2,413 volunteers registered to the website. Among these, 2,364 persons completed the questionnaires and laboratory tests. We analyzed the data of 2,356 participants and excluded 8 persons less than 35 yr of actual age.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements and definitions</title><p>The subjects came to the specified hospital(s) in each city after overnight fasting for at least 12 hr, completed the questionnaires, and completed blood and urine tests. Baseline demographics such as age, gender, weight (kg), height (cm), area of residence, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and laboratory tests such as serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr), fasting serum glucose, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and single voided fasting urine albumin to creatinine ratio (mg albumin/g creatinine: UACR) were examined. Arterial blood pressure was measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer after participants sat for at least 15 min in each specified hospital. Participants reported their respective comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular events, and renal disease; current smoking habits; family history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, renal disease, cerebrovascular events, or cancer; and medications for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The serum creatinine was measured by an automatic analyzer using the Jaffe method in all participating hospitals. Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Albuminuria was defined as a UACR of 30 mg/g or more. Microalbuminuria was defined as a UACR ranging from 30 to 299 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria was defined as a UACR of 300 mg/g or more. Referencing the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) working group, CKD was defined as the presence of albuminuria or eGFR &#x0003c;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Stages of CKD were defined as follows: stage 1 (eGFR &#x02265;90 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and UACR &#x02265;30 mg/g); stage 2 (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and UACR &#x02265;30 mg/g); stage 3 (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> regardless of UACR); stage 4 (eGFR 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> regardless of UACR); and stage 5 (eGFR &#x0003c;15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> regardless of UACR).</p><p>Hypertension was defined as SBP of 140 mmHg or greater, DBP of 90 mmHg or greater, or use of antihypertensive medications irrespective of BP. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a fasting glucose of 126 mg/dL or greater or use of hypoglycemic agents. A history of cardiovascular events was defined as a history of coronary arterial disease or cerebrovascular accident. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on weight and height (weight [kg]/height [m<sup>2</sup>]). BMI groups were classified as less than the 10th percentile (BMI &#x0003c;20.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 10th to 50th percentile (BMI 20.7 to 24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 50th to 90th percentile (BMI 24.1 to 28.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and greater than the 90th percentile (BMI &#x0003e;28.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), as proposed in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All analyses and calculations were performed using SPSS software (SPSS version 12.0, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.). Data are presented as the means&#x000b1;SDs for continuous variables and as proportions for categorical variables. Demographic and clinical data were described and compared between groups. Differences were analyzed using the chi-square test for categorical variables and the Student t test or one-way ANOVA for continuous variables according to the number of groups. The odds ratio (OR) between the factors and CKD was calculated using logistic regression analysis with or without adjustment for age, gender, BMI, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, which are well known risk factors for CKD. <italic>p</italic> values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Characteristics of participants</title><p>The proportions of age and gender in the study group were no different compared to those in the general populations in each city (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Of the 2,356 participants, 1,151 (48.8%) were male and 1,205 (51.2%) were female. The mean participant age was 50.5&#x000b1;11.1 yr. The prevalences of hypertension and diabetes mellitus were 35.5% and 10.1%, respectively. The serum creatinine was 0.83&#x000b1;0.11 mg/dL in women and 1.09&#x000b1;0.45 mg/dL in men; it slightly increased with age in women (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), but it did not differ among the various age groups in men (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The eGFR level was 79.4&#x000b1;12.6 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in women and 79.3&#x000b1;12.7 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in men. The mean eGFRs in age groups, 35-44 yr, 45-54 yr, 55-64 yr, and 65 yr or more were 85.3, 80.0, 74.6, and 70.5 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in females, respectively, and 83.0, 79.3, 77.0, and 71.9 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, in males, respectively. The mean eGFR level decreased with age at a rate of 4.24 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/10 yr in females and at a rate of 4.08 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/10 yr in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The UACR level was 24.2&#x000b1;115.7 mg/g (median: 5.2 mg/g) in women and 26.9&#x000b1;132.6 mg/g (median: 3.8 mg/g) in men, with no statistical difference noted between the gender groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Prevalence of CKD</title><p>The overall prevalence of CKD was 13.7%.

The prevalence of higher BMI (more than 90th percentile) increased in women, but decreased in men, with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Participants with middle range BMIs (10th to 50th percentile) showed the lowest prevalence of CKD; higher BMIs were related to higher CKD prevalence (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The prevalence of CKD was increased with the presence of previous cardiovascular events, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, and with increases in SBP, DBP, serum glucose, serum cholesterol, and serum LDL-cholesterol (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Prevalence of albuminuria</title><p>The prevalences of albuminuria, microalbuminuria, and macroalbuminuria were 10.2%, 8.6%, and 1.6%, respectively.

The adjusted OR for CKD in subjects with DBPs 90 mmHg or more was 2.308 (<italic>p</italic>=0.002) compared to subjects with DBP less than 70 mmHg. The prevalence of CKD in subjects with fasting glucose levels of 126 mg/dL or more was 2.169 times that in subjects with fasting glucose less than 110 mg/dL (<italic>p</italic>=0.015).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Based on the results of this study, we report the prevalence of CKD to be 13.7% in urban Koreans, and we estimate that 3.2 million urban Koreans age 35 yr or older may have chronic kidney disease. Factors such as older age, high BMI, hypertension, diabetes, high blood pressures, and high fasting blood glucose were associated with an increased prevalence of CKD. Although the participants in this study were volunteers, they were representative of the overall urban Korean population age 35 yr or greater for the following reasons. First, we matched the age, gender, and sub-district of origin for participants to those in the general population. Second, we only allowed one study participant per family to exclude confounding by genetic effects. Third, almost half of Koreans age 35 yr or greater live in the 7 selected cities according to the 2006 Korean Population Census.</p><p>The prevalence of CKD differs in various ethnic groups. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III, conducted from 1988 to 1994, the prevalence of CKD was 11.0%, and the prevalence of decreased renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was 4.7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In an Australian survey, the prevalences of CKD and decreased renal function were 13.1% and 11.2%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In Japan, the prevalence of decreased renal function was as high as 19.2%, with estimation of eGFR using Japanese coefficient 0.881 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Among Chinese patients more than 40 yr of age living in Beijing, the prevalences of CKD and decreased renal function were calculated to be 12.6% and 4.9%, respectively, based on the simplified MDRD equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). These findings were similar to our results (13.7% and 5.0%). However, the simplified MDRD equation is not easily applied in all races, especially in Asians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). There are modifications of the MDRD equation for Japanese and the Chinese populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). With support from the Korean Society of Nephrology, the study is proceeding to determine if the MDRD equation is applicable in Korean patients and to determine if a modification coefficient is needed in the Korean equation. Hence, the eGFR in this study was limited in its estimate of the prevalence of CKD. When we calculated the eGFR using the Cockcroft-Gault equation divided by the body surface area (CG/BSA), described in a previous report by Coresh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), the overall prevalence of CKD was 17.0% (401/2,356), and the prevalence of CKD stage 3 or more was 8.6% (203/2,356). These figures were higher than those obtained using the MDRD equation. Other studies have also shown a higher prevalence of CKD using the CG/BSA equation, compared to the MDRD equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). There is still debate concerning which is the more accurate equation to estimate GFR, especially in Asian patients. Hence, we need to re-analyze this data in the near future according to the new method of estimating GFR. The prevalence of CKD in subjects with routine health check-up from a Korean tertiary hospital was 16.1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) higher than that of this study because the criteria of albuminuria in that study was defined by the result of urine dipstick test, the hematuria was also regarded as the sign of renal damage, and the study population was not matched to the general population but included from the visitors to health promotion center of a tertiary hospital.</p><p>Advanced age is a well known risk factor for CKD, and our study supported this finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Individuals without diabetes mellitus or hypertension, which are also independent risk factors for CKD that increase with aging, were more likely to have CKD and decreased renal function in old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The prevalence of decreased renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was low in younger participants (0.3% in age group 35 to 44 yr, 1.1% in age group 45 to 54 yr) without diabetes or hypertension, but it was quite high (21.1%) among subjects older than 65 yr of age without diabetes or hypertension, similar to the NHANES III report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Male gender is known as a risk factor for ESRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In women, the cumulative incidence of ESRD remains lower than that of men during the reproductive years, but then increases after menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). However, in many cross-sectional studies, the prevalence of CKD is greater in women than it is in men. The NHANES data showed a higher prevalence of CKD in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The AusDiab study also reported a significant gender difference (9.3% in males and 13.0% in females) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In the present study, there were no differences in the CKD prevalences between the genders. However, male participants younger than 50 yr of age showed a higher prevalence of CKD than females of the same age did, and female participants 50 yr of age or more had a higher prevalence of CKD than male participants did. One of the possible explanations of the gender difference in CKD prevalence according to age was that the increase rates of the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and higher BMI with aging in females were higher than in males from the ages of 40-50 yr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>In our study, high BMI was also an independent predictor of CKD, as in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). High BMI was an independent risk factor of decreased renal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and was also associated with an increased incidence of ESRD in Japanese individuals living on Okinawa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In the present study, the risk of CKD increased in participants with BMI greater than 24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which means that the modest increase in BMI could be a risk factor for renal injury in Asian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). This is consistent with the findings that Asians develop cardiovascular complications at lower BMIs compared to white individuals and that the upper limit of normal BMI for Asians is closer to 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> than it is to 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>It is already known that factors such as hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), and blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) contribute to CKD, which is also evident in this study. We confirmed that systolic blood pressures of 130 mmHg or more, diastolic blood pressures of 90 mmHg or more, and fasting blood glucose levels of 126 mg/dL or more were independently related to the prevalence of CKD.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. First, study participants were not randomly selected across the whole nation, and they were mainly urbanites. This indicates a selection bias. However, the selected participants were representative of urban residents because they were selected in proportion to the age and sex of the general populations in the 7 cities, which contain approximately 50% of the Korean population. Second, the present study was a cross-sectional design. Therefore, we could not confirm definite causality between CKD and its risk factors. Third, for laboratory studies, estimation was based on one measurement and might have false positive or false negative errors. CKD patients in this study may or may not have had acute renal insufficiency. Although the method used to measure serum creatinine in participating hospitals was the Jaffe method, the auto-analyzer models differed. We did not standardize the serum creatinine result among hospitals. These factors could have led to overestimation or underestimation of the prevalence of CKD. And, as stated above, the MDRD equation for Koreans has not been validated and is under investigation. For this reason, the CG/BSA equation was also used for estimating GFR on supplementary analysis.</p><p>Despite the above limitations, the present study is the first epidemiologic study designed to survey the prevalence of CKD in Korea. The prevalence of CKD in Korea was 13.7%, which is similar to that seen in Chinese patients in Beijing. The factors associated with CKD were age, BMI, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, blood pressure, and fasting glucose. Korea, in which the prevalence of CKD including ESRD is increasing, should prepare a policy of early detection and appropriate treatment for CKD patients. The present data will be helpful in taking this action.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank Dr. Seung Seok Han for wonderful assistance to refine this paper and all
