The vector-borne nematode, <italic>Setaria tundra</italic>, caused a serious disease outbreak in the Finnish reindeer population in 2003&#x02013;05. The main aim of this study was to understand the outbreak dynamics and the rapid expansion of <italic>S. tundra </italic>in the sub arctic. We describe the vectors of <italic>S. tundra</italic>, and its development in vectors, for the first time. Finally we discuss the results in the context of the host-parasite ecology of <italic>S. tundra </italic>in Finland</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Development of <italic>S. tundra </italic>to the infective stage occurs in mosquitoes, (genera <italic>Aedes </italic>and <italic>Anopheles</italic>). We consider <italic>Aedes </italic>spp. the most important vectors. The prevalence of <italic>S. tundra </italic>naturally infected mosquitoes from Finland varied from 0.5 to 2.5%. The rate of development in mosquitoes was temperature-dependent. Infective larvae were present approximately 14 days after a blood meal in mosquitoes maintained at room temperature (mean 21 C), but did not develop in mosquitoes maintained outside for 22 days at a mean temperature of 14.1 C. The third-stage (infective) larvae were elongated (mean length 1411 &#x003bc;m (SD 207), and width 28 &#x003bc;m (SD 2)). The anterior end was blunt, and bore two liplike structures, the posterior end slight tapering with a prominent terminal papilla. Infective larvae were distributed anteriorly in the insect's body, the highest abundance being 70 larvae in one mosquito. A questionnaire survey revealed that the peak activity of Culicidae in the reindeer herding areas of Finland was from the middle of June to the end of July and that warm summer weather was associated with reindeer flocking behaviour on mosquito-rich wetlands.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present work, <italic>S. tundra </italic>vectors and larval development were identified and described for the first time. <italic>Aedes </italic>spp. mosquitoes likely serve as the most important and competent vectors for <italic>S. tundra </italic>in Finland. Warm summers apparently promote transmission and genesis of disease outbreaks by favouring the development of <italic>S. tundra </italic>in its mosquito vectors, by improving the development and longevity of mosquitoes, and finally by forcing the reindeer to flock on mosquito rich wetlands. Thus we predict that global climate change has the potential to promote the further emergence of Filarioid nematodes and the disease caused by them in subarctic regions.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>There is recent evidence documenting the range expansion of parasites of domestic and free-ranging ungulates to subarctic areas including, in Finland, an array of vector-borne Filarioid nematodes and the diseases associated with them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These findings are not surprising, since the potential impacts of global warming are predicted to include shifts in the spatial-temporal distribution of disease vectors, and hence the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There is still a lack of basic knowledge, however, about how insect populations, their vector competence, and parasite-host ecology respond to these changes.</p><p><italic>Setaria tundra </italic>(Filarioidea: Onchocercidae) was the causative agent of severe outbreaks of peritonitis in semi-domestic reindeer (<italic>Rangifer tarandus tarandus</italic>) in Finland in 1973 and in 2003&#x02013;05, and in moose (European elk, <italic>Alces alces</italic>) in Lapland in 1989 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The most recent outbreak started in 2003 in the southern part of the Finnish reindeer herding area and the focus of the outbreak has moved northwards approximately 100 km each year.</p><p>In this latest outbreak the prevalence and level of infection were very high in the calves, and caused substantial economic losses to the reindeer herders. Adult reindeer were suggested as the main source of infection for the calves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], together with wild forest reindeer (<italic>Rangifer tarandus fennicus</italic>) and roe deer (<italic>Capreolus capreolus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The genus <italic>Setaria </italic>includes 43 species that are found in the abdominal cavities of artiodactyls. All these species produce microfilariae (mf) which are present in host blood where they are available to the arthropod vectors. The mf are taken up in the blood meal of the vector where they develop into the infective third larval stage. When the vector feeds again, the larvae break out and enter the tissue of the definitive host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The life cycle of <italic>S. tundra </italic>in the Northern Europe is poorly understood. In California, the mosquito <italic>Aedes sierrensis </italic>serves as a vector for a related species, <italic>Setaria yehi</italic>, which parasitizes white-tailed deer (<italic>Odocoileus virginianus</italic>). In this host-parasite system, transmission is facilitated by the peak appearance of mosquitoes following the fawning season of the deer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Other known insect vectors for <italic>Setaria </italic>spp are other <italic>Aedes </italic>spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], <italic>Anopheles </italic>spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and horn flies, <italic>Haematobia irritans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and <italic>H. stimulans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>To date there is only scant information about the transmission of <italic>S. tundra </italic>other than the recent studies in Finland on the peritonitis outbreak in reindeer and mf burden in cervids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The assumption that <italic>S. tundra </italic>is transmitted by haematophagous vectors is supported by the seasonal midsummer peak in <italic>Setaria </italic>microfilaria (Smf) density in reindeer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and by the well known attacks on herds of caribou/reindeer in the summer by massive swarms of blood-feeding insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The aims of the present study were: 1) to identify significant vectors for <italic>S. tundra </italic>in Finland; 2) to describe larval development in these vectors; and 3) to use this knowledge to explore basic features of parasite transmission, including outbreak dynamics and the rapid geographic expansion of <italic>S. tundra </italic>in Finland.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Setaria tundra larvae in wild haematophagous insects</title><p>Data for <italic>S. tundra </italic>occurrence in wild-netted <italic>Aedes </italic>spp. mosquitoes and in sympatric reindeer are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

Larvae reached the sausage stage after days 4 to 6, and at this stage had a short, distinct tail and, in the more developed larvae, the mouth, oesophagus and intestine were quite distinct. After days 9 to 10 the larvae were slender and had approximately doubled in length. In these second-stage larvae, the anal plug was visible, but the tail had been lost during the first moult. At this stage, the lumen of the intestine and oesophagus were distinct. Finally, approximately two weeks after the blood meal, and following the second moult, infective elongated third-stage larvae were present. The anterior ends of these larvae were blunt, slightly tapering and bore two liplike structures, the posterior ends were slightly tapering from the anus with a prominent terminal (knoblike) papilla. The intestines were broad, round, and tubular and showed much variation.

The results indicate that overall harassment by flying mosquitoes during the summers of -2003, -2004 and -2005 was less severe than the average (for 2003, 69% of respondents, for 2004, 77%, and for 2005, 46%, respectively) or about average (29%, 22% and 52% or respondents, respectively) in the whole reindeer herding area. Respondents also reported that the peak activity of Culicidae occurs from mid-June to the end of July (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

According to 86% of the Chiefs, weather conditions and insect harassment alter reindeer behaviour so that during warm weather reindeer flock mostly in wetlands, swamps and riversides, and sometimes in forests (18% of respondents) in fells (14%) and different kinds of open expanses (16%).

The study has also provided information on the morphological changes in <italic>S. tundra </italic>larvae developing in mosquitoes, and on the distribution of these larvae in the vectors. It has also demonstrated that at a mean temperature of 21 C larvae develop to the infective third stage in approximately two weeks, while at a mean temperature of 14.1 C, development is not completed. Finally, questionnaire results suggest a linkage between levels of vector activity in the field and the transmission of <italic>S. tundra </italic>among reindeer.</p><p>The morphological changes, distributions and development rates of <italic>S. tundra </italic>in mosquitoes, observed in the present study are similar to those for other <italic>Setaria </italic>spp. described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In the present study there was considerable variation in the morphology of the developing larval stages, as observed earlier for species of the Filarioidea developing in different vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These variations might make the identification of the larvae difficult other than at the family level, and illustrate the role of PCR-based methods for species identification.</p><p>The vast majority of mosquitoes active in midsummer in Finland are species of <italic>Aedes </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although <italic>Anopheles </italic>mosquitoes are also present, and can serve as vectors for <italic>S. tundra</italic>, their epidemiologic significance in Finland is likely limited because of their life cycle parameters and low numbers compared to <italic>Aedes </italic>spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The role of <italic>Anopheles </italic>mosquitoes may be more important in more temperate areas or may increase in Finland during climate change. Our results suggest that <italic>S. tundra </italic>is not a very vector-specific parasite, and this may enhance its ability to expand its geographic range. Also, adult female <italic>Aedes </italic>spp. are vigorous round-the-clock feeders that can be infected with many infective <italic>S. tundra </italic>larvae (up to 70 in the present study). This high larval abundance may, however, decrease vector efficiency and increase vector mortality.</p><p>The transmission of <italic>S. tundra </italic>is highly dependent on the life span of the female mosquitoes, with survival of adult mosquitoes depending in part on both temperature and humidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. There is unfortunately no information on the longevity of mosquito populations in Finland, although in the present study adult <italic>Aedes </italic>spp. survived approximately four weeks in a laboratory insectary at room temperature. In the present study, older females were a considerable part of the "wild" mosquito population. It is interesting that although the <italic>S. tundra </italic>outbreak in Sweden in 1973 was associated with the appearance of especially large numbers of mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the longevity of the mosquitoes is also important.</p><p>The peak period of <italic>S. tundra </italic>microfilaremia in reindeer is from mid June to the end of August [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which data from the questionnaire suggest co-incides with the peak activity of mosquitoes. Some estimates suggest that reindeer can be exposed to attacks of approximately 8000 mosquitoes/hour during the r&#x000e4;kk&#x000e4;-time (the appearance of mass insect harassment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These peaks in microfilaremia and insect abundance and contact with reindeer occur just after the calving season, when the reindeer shed their winter hair leaving their skin relatively exposed to the attacks of mosquitoes. This synchrony likely promotes the transmission of <italic>S. tundra </italic>from adult carriers to calves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In highly endemic areas, the prevalence of Filarioid infection rarely exceeds 1% of the total mosquito population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this study, <italic>S. tundra </italic>prevalence in different mosquito populations in endemic areas was 0.5&#x02013;2.5%, the highest prevalence being around the experimental zoo, an urban park-like environment, on the outskirts of Oulu city.</p><p>In the present study, according to the questionnaire results, warm summers were associated with hundreds of reindeer flocking in dense herds in mosquito-rich wetlands. This behaviour may be explained by the availability of drinking water and fresh food plants or the benefits of the habitat for thermoregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In these areas the microclimate is favourable for mosquitoes and it is possible that in these kinds of highly endemic areas, the prevalence and abundance of <italic>S. tundra </italic>in mosquitoes is very high. In a previous study in upper Lapland, the ancient destination of reindeer summer migration, neither peritonitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] nor mf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], were found in reindeer, and there mosquitoes infected with <italic>S. tundra </italic>were not found. These observations suggest that the migrations of reindeer and the characteristics of reindeer pastures can affect the transmission dynamics of <italic>S. tundra</italic>. This may help explain the numerous discoveries by reindeer herders of great variation in <italic>S. tundra </italic>levels in reindeer herds originating from different summer pastures. In Uzbekistan, the highest prevalence of <italic>S. labiatopapillosa </italic>in cattle was found in irrigated, marshy and river catchment areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is also important to note that wetlands constitute about 30 to 40% of the total land area of the <italic>S. tundra </italic>outbreak area but only about 12% of upper Lapland, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] which is believed to be free of <italic>S. tundra </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study has revealed the lack of basic knowledge of filarial larvae in their vectors in northern latitudes. In Finland, mosquitoes, especially <italic>Aedes </italic>spp., are efficient and likely the most important vectors of <italic>S. tundra</italic>. A key factor promoting the transmission of this parasite is warm ambient summer temperature. Within limits, this warmth improves mosquitoes' development, reproduction, longevity and feeding habits, as well as the larval development of <italic>S. tundra</italic>. Warm summers, which may become warmer as a consequence of climate change, also force the reindeer to flock and stay on mosquito-rich wetlands, behaviour which might increase the infection pressure. It is likely that climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] favours the northward expansion of Filarioid nematodes, which might then become an even greater threat to arctic ungulate populations. The current study has provided baseline information that will improve understanding of the ecology and dynamics of <italic>S. tundra </italic>and of disease outbreaks associated with the parasite. The information could also be useful in predicting and preventing these outbreaks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Identification of significant vectors for S. tundra</title><p>To estimate the prevalence of <italic>S. tundra </italic>larvae in arthropod populations in different <italic>S. tundra </italic>endemic areas, insect samples were collected from various locations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).
