Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a naturally occurring component of <italic>Brassica </italic>vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli and Brussels sprout, is a promising chemopreventive agent as it is reported to possess antimutagenic, antitumorigenic and antiestrogenic properties in experimental studies. The aim of this study was to determine the potential anti-ATLL effects of I3C both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the <italic>in vitro </italic>study, I3C inhibited cell viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and ATLL cells in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, I3C did not exert any inhibitory effect on uninfected T-cell lines and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. I3C prevented the G<sub>1</sub>/S transition by reducing the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, Cdk4 and Cdk6, and induced apoptosis by reducing the expression of XIAP, survivin and Bcl-2, and by upregulating the expression of Bak. The induced apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. I3C also suppressed I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation and JunD expression, resulting in inactivation of NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1. Inoculation of HTLV-1-infected T cells in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency resulted in tumor growth. The latter was inhibited by treatment with I3C (50 mg/kg/day orally), but not the vehicle control.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our preclinical data suggest that I3C could be potentially a useful chemotherapeutic agent for patients with ATLL.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a fatal T-cell malignancy caused by infection of mature CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. ATLL is clinically and hematologically subclassified into four subtypes: acute, lymphoma, chronic and smoldering. In the relatively indolent smoldering and chronic types, the median survival time is &#x02265; 2 years. However, currently, there is no accepted curative therapy for ATLL and the condition often progresses to death with a median survival time of 13 months in aggressive ATLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Death is usually due to severe infection or hypercalcemia, often associated with resistance to intensive, combined chemotherapy. Therefore, the establishment of new therapeutic strategies for ATLL is deemed critical.</p><p>ATLL arises after a long latent period of over 50 years and involves a multi-step mechanism of tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although the mechanism of transformation and leukemogenesis is not fully elucidated, there is evidence to suggest that the viral oncoprotein Tax plays a crucial role in these processes through the regulation of several pathways including NF-&#x003ba;B and the cell-cycle pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The observation that Tax-induced NF-&#x003ba;B is indispensable for the maintenance of the malignant phenotype of HTLV-1, through the regulation of expression of various genes involved in cell-cycle regulation and inhibition of apoptosis, provides a possible molecular target for ATLL.</p><p>Indol-3-carbinol (I3C) is an autolysis product of a glucosinolate, glucobrassicin, found in <italic>Brassica </italic>species or cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels spouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The chemopreventive potential of I3C has received much attention in light of its reported <italic>in vivo </italic>efficacy in protection against chemically-induced carcinogenesis in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, the clinical benefits of I3C have also been shown in human clinical trials for cervical dysplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Despite these advances in translational research, the mechanism by which I3C inhibits tumorigenesis remains inconclusive. Mechanistic evidence indicates that I3C facilitates growth arrest and apoptosis by targeting a broad range of signaling pathways pertinent to cell-cycle regulation and survival, including those mediated by Akt, NF-&#x003ba;B and mitogen-activated protein kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, as these signaling targets often operate in a cell-specific fashion, it remains controversial whether any of them solely accounts for the effect of I3C on growth arrest and apoptosis of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>I3C has also been shown to suppress the proliferation of various tumor cells including breast cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, colon cancer and myeloid leukemia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, the potential of I3C to inhibit the proliferation of ATLL cells has not been evaluated. In this study, we investigated the effects of I3C on cell growth and apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected and uninfected T-cell lines and primary ATLL cells. The results demonstrated selective effects on HTLV-1-infected malignant T cells and support a potential therapeutic role for I3C in patients with ATLL.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>I3C inhibits cell viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell linesand primary ATLL cells</title><p>First, we examined the effects of I3C on cell viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. We used two HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines (MT-4 and HUT-102), an ATLL-derived T-cell line (TL-OmI) and three HTLV-1-negative T-cell lines (MOLT-4, Jurkat and CCRF-CEM). Tax protein was detected by immunoblot analysis in the two HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines but not in the ATLL-derived T-cell line (data not shown). Cell viability was assessed by the water-soluble tetrazolium (WST)-8 assay kit. Culture of cells with various concentrations of I3C for 72 h resulted in the suppression of cell viability in a dose-dependent manner in all three lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The effect of I3C was not significant on control uninfected T-cell lines.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibitory effects of I3C on cell viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and primary ATLL cells</bold>.

Relative viability of cultured cells is presented as the mean determined on cell lines (A) and PBMC from healthy controls and ATLL patients (B) from triplicate cultures. A relative viability of 100% was designated as total number of cells that grew in 72-h cultures in the absence of I3C. HUT-102, MT-4 and TL-OmI are HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines; Jurkat, MOLT-4 and CCRF-CEM, uninfected T-cell lines used as controls.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, I3C inhibited cell viability of fresh ATLL cells. It seems that there are two groups of ATLL samples. One of them (ATLL 2, 3 and 6) is more sensitive to I3C than the other. However, there were no differences between two groups in terms of the clinical parameters, such as white blood cells count, proportion of ATLL cells, lactate dehydrogenase level and survival time (data not shown). All patients were negative for Tax protein by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Importantly, I3C up to 100 &#x003bc;M had no effect on viability of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from four healthy donors.</p></sec><sec><title>I3C treatment causes G<sub>1</sub>/S cell-cycle arrest in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines</title><p>Next, we examined the cellular DNA contents distribution by flow cytometric analysis following cell treatment. In all HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, I3C induced significant changes in the cell-cycle distribution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Cultivation with I3C for 12 h increased the population of cells in the G<sub>1 </sub>phase, with a marked reduction of cells in the S phase. These changes were primarily the result of a G<sub>1</sub>/S cell-cycle arrest in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. At 24 h after treatment, the population of cells in the pre-G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>region, regarded as apoptotic cells, was increased (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>I3C induces cell-cycle arrest in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines</bold>.

I3C increased the proportion of apoptotic cells in all HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, but not in uninfected T-cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). A significant increase in the apoptotic population was detected in HUT-102 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). A similar experiment was also performed with Hoechst 33342 staining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). This staining allows evaluation of chromatin condensation, which is a hallmark of apoptosis. Consistent with the above results, I3C significantly increased DNA degradation in HUT-102 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that I3C inhibits cell viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines through cell apoptosis.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>I3C induces apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines</bold>.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, I3C did not alter Bax and Bcl-xL levels in HUT-102 and TL-OmI cells. In contrast, I3C significantly decreased the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, Cdk4 and Cdk6 in HUT-102 and TL-OmI cells in a time-dependent manner. I3C dose-dependently decreased the levels of expression of these proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Although XIAP was not detected in TL-OmI cells, I3C decreased its expression in HUT-102 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. I3C also decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and survivin in HUT-102 and TL-OmI cells, respectively. In contrast, the expression of Bak was increased in TL-OmI cells treated with I3C for 48 h. Western blot analysis showed that I3C treatment had no effect on Tax expression in HUT-102 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Comparable loading of protein was confirmed with a specific antibody for the housekeeping gene product actin. Furthermore, mRNA expression of Tax and HBZ, which was recently identified in the 3'-long terminal repeat of the complementary sequence of HTLV-1 and has been suggested as a critical gene in leukemogenesis of ATLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], in HUT-102 and TL-OmI cells treated with I3C, was examined by RT-PCR. However, both mRNA expression levels were not affected by I3C treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>I3C modulates activated NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1</title><p>NF-&#x003ba;B is a transcription factor involved in the control of apoptosis, cell-cycle progression and cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B is constitutively activated in Tax-expressing and HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines as well as primary ATLL cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and such activation correlates with leukemogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

To study the DNA-binding activity of NF-&#x003ba;B, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with radiolabeled double-stranded NF-&#x003ba;B oligonucleotides and nuclear extracts from untreated or I3C-treated HUT-102 cells. NF-&#x003ba;B oligonucleotide probe with nuclear extracts from untreated HUT-102 cells generated DNA-protein gel shift complexes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, top panel).

This finding suggests that I3C downregulates the DNA-binding activities of NF-&#x003ba;B.

Untreated HUT-102 and TL-OmI cells constitutively expressed Ser32/36-phosphorylated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, while I3C treatment decreased the phosphorylated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; in a time-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), with a concomitant rise in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; level. These results suggest that I3C inhibits phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; followed by accumulation of this protein. We next examined the effect of I3C on the cellular distribution of NF-&#x003ba;B components using fluorescence microscopy. I3C blocked nuclear localization of NF-&#x003ba;B p65 in HUT-102 cells, which constitutively express this protein in the cell nucleus in the absence of I3C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).</p><p>Transcription factor AP-1 is also identified as a crucial mediator of both cell-cycle enhancing and cell death inhibiting pathways in HTLV-1-infected T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

Therefore, we focused on AP-1 inactivation after exposure to I3C. HUT-102 cells exhibited elevated constitutive AP-1 DNA-binding activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, middle panel). I3C also reduced AP-1 DNA-binding activity. HTLV-1-infected T-cells with increased AP-1 DNA-binding activity contained Jun D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. I3C decreased time-dependently the expression of JunD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). These findings suggest that I3C depletes JunD, resulting in inactivation of AP-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemotherapeutic effects of I3C on subcutaneous HUT-102 tumors</title><p>Finally, we examined the effects of I3C against ATLL <italic>in vivo</italic>. SCID mice (<italic>n </italic>= 12) were inoculated with HUT-102 and then divided into two groups: untreated mice (<italic>n </italic>= 6) and I3C-treated mice (<italic>n </italic>= 6).

During treatment, all mice displayed no adverse events with respect to general appearance, body weight (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>) and food intake. I3C did not affect tumor incidence but significantly slowed the growth of the transplanted tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).

There has been only very limited improvement in the prognosis of ATLL during the past several years. However, few well established pathways including NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 have been shown to be tightly regulated in HTLV-1-infected T-cells and therefore providing viable targets for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The present investigation shows that I3C selectively inhibits cell viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and primary ATLL cells. The 50% inhibitory drug concentration (IC50) values in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and primary ATLL cells were 23.7&#x02013;67.4 &#x003bc;M and 18.3&#x02013;69.5 &#x003bc;M, respectively. We also showed that I3C induces G<sub>1</sub>/S cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. In addition, our results provide mechanistic information on how I3C exerts its cytostatic and proapoptotic effects on HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines (i.e., by inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 activity). Inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activity is mediated by blocking the phosphorylation of the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitory protein I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and by preventing nuclear translocation of the NF-&#x003ba;B complex. Suppression of constitutive NF-&#x003ba;B activation by I3C in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines is consistent with previous reports, which showed the suppression of constitutive NF-&#x003ba;B in PC3 prostate cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and acute myelogenous leukemia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our studies are the first to indicate that I3C also inhibits JunD expression, resulting in the suppression of AP-1 DNA-binding.</p><p>We showed that I3C inhibited NF-&#x003ba;B-regulated gene products involved in cell proliferation (<italic>e.g</italic>., cyclin D1, cyclin D2, Cdk4 and Cdk6) and antiapoptosis (<italic>e.g</italic>., XIAP, survivin and Bcl-2). Although cyclin D1 expression is regulated by NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], AP-1 proteins also bind directly to the cyclin D1 promoter and activate it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, the cyclin D2 promoter contains NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It is therefore likely that NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1, in concert, support proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T cells by activating cyclin D1 and cyclin D2. We speculate that I3C inhibits cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 expression through the suppression of both NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1, resulting in the induction of cell-cycle arrest at the G<sub>1 </sub>phase. Although Bcl-xL expression is regulated by NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1, STAT and Ets also regulate its expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore, I3C might fail to affect the expression of Bcl-xL.</p><p>The HTLV-1 encodes the oncoptotein Tax from its <italic>pX </italic>gene and the minus strand of the provirus encodes HBZ. Tax and HBZ play a central role in leukemogenesis of ATLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Tax activates not only viral replication but also induces the expression of cellular genes through NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 activation. HBZ interacts with JunD to activate the transcription of JunD-dependent promoters of cellular genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. HBZ RNA promotes T-cell proliferation and upregulates E2F1 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. We examined the levels of Tax and HBZ expression in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, HUT-102 and TL-OmI, but both were not molecular targets of I3C treatment.</p><p>Increasing attention is being paid to the possible use of agents that prevent the development of ATLL in individuals at high risk. For this purpose, the use of natural compounds for ATLL prevention has practical advantages with regard to availability, suitability for oral application, regulatory approval and mechanisms of action. Candidate substances present in foods and plants have been identified by experimental studies. Green tea polyphenols inhibit <italic>in vitro </italic>growth of ATLL cells as well as an HTLV-1-infected T-cell line, by inducing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The daily intake of capsulated green tea for 5 months significantly diminished the HTLV-1 provirus load compared with the controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>Given the pharmacological safety of I3C (established through centuries of dietary intake), our study suggests that this compound has great potential as both a chemopreventive and a chemotherapeutic agent, especially when used in combination with other agents. Whether the concentrations of I3C used in our studies are achievable <italic>in vivo </italic>remains to be determined. After oral administration of I3C (250 mg/kg) to mice, the compound was rapidly absorbed and reached a peak concentration of 4.1 &#x003bc;g/ml at the earliest sampling time point of 15 min after dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. I3C was rapidly and extensively distributed into sampled tissues, with highest concentrations in the liver (24.5 &#x003bc;g/g tissue). This concentration is equivalent to 165.4 &#x003bc;M, suggesting that the therapeutically effective concentrations of I3C used in the present studies may be achievable <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>ATLL remains of poor prognosis. Novel effective drugs are warranted to reduce the emergence of resistant clones. Because the average Japanese ATLL patient is 60 year old, severe side effects and complications such as serious infections due to anti-cancer drugs are major problems in the clinical setting. Natural compounds may be safer than the currently available chemotherapeutic drugs. In particular, I3C might be useful in elderly patients or in immunocompromised patients because of its safety and lack of known toxicity. Overall, our results demonstrate that I3C is a potent inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 activation, which may explain its antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects. Our results further extend the potential preventive and therapeutic application of I3C for ATLL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have demonstrated that a dietary agent, I3C, has potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties <italic>in vitro </italic>and is systemically active against aggressive ATLL in mice. In addition, I3C is well tolerated by the host animal in therapeutically beneficial doses, making it an attractive candidate for further preclinical testing as an anti-ATLL agent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells</title><p>HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, HUT-102 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], MT-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and TL-OmI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], HTLV-1-uninfected T-cell line, Jurkat, MOLT-4 and CCRF-CEM, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin.
