HSP90 inhibitors induce depletion of clients, which include several oncogenic kinases. We hypothesised that the targeting of CDC37 using siRNAs would compromise the maturation of these clients and increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to HSP90 inhibitors. Here we show that silencing of CDC37 in human colon cancer cells diminished association of kinase clients with HSP90 and reduced levels of the clients ERBB2, CRAF, CDK4 and CDK6, as well as phosphorylated AKT. CDC37 silencing promoted the proteasome-mediated degradation of kinase clients, suggesting a degradation pathway independent from HSP90 binding. Decreased cell signalling through kinase clients was also demonstrated by reduced phosphorylation of downstream substrates and colon cancer cell proliferation was subsequently reduced by inhibition of the G1/S-phase transition. Furthermore, combining CDC37 silencing with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG induced more extensive and sustained depletion of kinase clients and potentiated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Similarly, we show that silencing CDC37 in colon carcinoma cells decreases signalling through kinase clients, which inhibits cell proliferation. We also demonstrate for the first time that silencing CDC37 impairs kinase client association with HSP90 and induces proteasome-dependent degradation of these clients. Furthermore, we show that CDC37 silencing sensitises colon cancer cells to HSP90 inhibitors by potentiating kinase client depletion, cell cycle arrest, and induction of apoptosis. Depletion of HSP90 kinase clients and sensitisation to HSP90 inhibition was confirmed in breast and prostate cancer cells. This study further validates the potential for therapeutic targeting of CDC37, either in combination with current HSP90 inhibitors or as a more client-selective alternative to HSP90 blockade.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CDC37 silencing reduces kinase client expression and signalling</title><p id="P8">siRNAs were designed which decreased CDC37 protein expression for up to 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1a-d</xref>).

Using these equivalent growth inhibitory concentrations, kinase clients were depleted to a similar extent when CDC37 was silenced, despite the lower concentration of 17-AAG used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6a</xref>). Partial recovery of CRAF expression after 17-AAG exposure was evident in mock and IC4 controls from 48-72h, but absent with CDC37 silencing.

Similar results were obtained comparing IC3 and O3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig S6</xref>), confirming prolonged kinase client depletion with silencing CDC37 in combination with 17-AAG treatment.</p><p id="P20">Since 5xGI<sub>50</sub> 17-AAG caused extensive depletion of kinase clients in the mock and IC4 conditions, an equimolar dose of 115nM (5xGI<sub>50</sub> of O3/O4), equivalent to 1.7x GI<sub>50</sub> of mock/IC4 controls, was used to compare the extent of client loss. Using 115nM 17-AAG, minimal depletion of most clients was observed at 24h in the control transfected cells, with almost complete recovery at 48h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6b</xref>). Following CDC37 silencing, however, kinase clients were fully depleted at 24h and remained so for longer than in mock and IC4 controls. Even by 72h 17-AAG treatment, expression of kinase clients had only partially recovered. Thus when CDC37 was silenced, kinases were extensively depleted using lower 17-AAG concentrations, providing an explanation for the observed sensitisation. This effect also appeared specific to CDC37-associated clients, since 17-AAG-induced depletion of GR was unchanged by CDC37 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6b</xref>). HSP72 induction by 17-AAG was also equivalent in all transfection conditions, confirming that CDC37 does not influence the heat shock response.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Proteasome-dependent degradation of kinase clients by CDC37 silencing and 17-AAG</title><p id="P21">To compare the mechanism by which kinase clients are depleted, we investigated the effects of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on 17-AAG treated or CDC37 silenced cells. As expected, inhibition of proteasomal degradation by MG132 caused an increase in the accumulation of kinase clients in an insoluble form following 17-AAG exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7a</xref>). Importantly, proteasome inhibition in the absence of HSP90 inhibitor also led to a greater accumulation of insoluble CDK4 and CRAF in CDC37 silenced cells compared with the non-silenced control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7a</xref>). The accumulation of insoluble CDK4 in CDC37 silenced cells was time-dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig S7</xref>). Proteasomal targeting of CDK4 following CDC37 silencing was further indicated by increased ubiquitination of this client after MG132 treatment, as compared to the control transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7b</xref>). These results show that both 17-AAG and CDC37 silencing lead to client depletion via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.</p><p id="P22">Analysis of the rate of CDK4 turnover by pulse chase showed that the stabilisation of newly synthesised CDK4 was not affected (t<sub>1/2</sub> &#x0223c;8h) after 4 days silencing of CDC37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7c</xref>), suggesting that the degradation of mature but unstable CDK4 was promoted.

Treatment with 17-AAG for 24h markedly decreased the association of CDK4 with HSP90 and CDC37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7d</xref>). Similarly, as demonstrated earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a,b</xref>), CDC37 silencing also severely restricted association of the client with HSP90. When CDC37 was silenced in combination with HSP90 inhibition, co-immunoprecipitation of CDK4 with CDC37 and HSP90 was reduced further. CDK4/cyclin D1 association remained after 17-AAG treatment and CDC37 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7d</xref>), consistent with earlier results indicating that the stability of this complex is not dependent on HSP90/CDC37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig S5</xref>). Notably, 17-AAG promoted the association of CDK4 with HSC70; however, CDC37 silencing alone did not appear to increase CDK4-HSC70 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7d</xref>). Similar results were obtained with CDK6 immunoprecipitates, where CDC37 silencing or 17-AAG treatment reduced the interaction with HSP90 and CDC37, and 17-AAG treatment marginally increased HSC70 co-immunoprecipitation with CDK6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig S8</xref>). The loss of CDK4 association with HSP90 and CDC37 occurred rapidly, as early as 1h after 17-AAG treatment and before CDK4 expression was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7e</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that CDC37 silencing and 17-AAG both cause the kinase client to dissociate from HSP90, but there appear to be differences in the involvement of HSC70 in directing client degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P24">HSP90 guides the stabilisation, activatable competence and degradation of client proteins, thereby regulating multiple signalling pathways.

A consistent reduction in ERBB2, CRAF, CDK4 and CDK6 expression was evident when CDC37 was silenced in human colon cancer cells. There was differential depletion between clients, an effect also seen with pharmacological HSP90 inhibition. Interestingly, one of the highly sensitive clients to HSP90 inhibition, ERBB2, was generally the most extensively depleted by CDC37 silencing. Similarly, the expression of CDK6, which is relatively insensitive to HSP90 inhibition, was less affected by CDC37 silencing. Thus, client proteins vary in their dependency on HSP90/CDC37 to maintain stability, with some clients, such as ERBB2, being particularly prone to degradation upon disruption of either of the stabilising components.</p><p id="P26">However, client stability appears to be cell context-dependent, since in HT29 cells ERBB2 depletion following CDC37 silencing was less prominent compared with other clients.</p><p id="P27">Our results showed that HSP90 association with clients CDK4 and CRAF was greatly reduced by CDC37 silencing, consistent with CDC37 promoting kinase client loading onto HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Siligardi et al. 2002</xref>). CDC37 may act either by first binding to the client and then recruiting it to HSP90, or by its presence in the chaperone complex enabling stable interaction with kinase clients. The order of binding is unclear since CDC37-HSP90 complexes free of clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Zhang et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Roe et al. 2004</xref>) and CDC37-kinase complexes without HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Vaughan et al. 2006</xref>) have been isolated.</p><p id="P28">An emerging view of the HSP90 chaperone system, supported by our studies of another cochaperone, AHA1, suggests that client stabilisation and activation may be two distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Holmes et al. 2008</xref>). Taken together with our present results, we hypothesise that the intermediate HSP90 chaperone complex, to which CDC37 promotes kinase loading, predominantly controls stability by preventing degradation, whereas formation of a mature complex by AHA1-promoted ATP hydrolysis modifies the competence of the client for activation. As this view suggests that stabilisation of clients precedes activation, modulation of CDC37 is likely also to impact on signalling activity.</p><p id="P29">Consistent with this, CDC37 silencing reduced the phosphorylation of substrates downstream of CDK4, CRAF and AKT. It is difficult to definitively ascertain the effect of CDC37 silencing on client activation per se, owing to the clear decrease in client expression. In contrast to our findings, using CDC37 shRNA in prostate cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gray and colleagues (2007)</xref> demonstrated reduced client activity without significant client depletion. Our results show that both extensive and sustained CDC37 silencing is required before client expression is affected since we did not observe kinase client depletion until 4-5 days, despite substantial loss of CDC37 expression by 48h. Under these conditions we were able to demonstrate considerable ERBB2 depletion and some decrease in CDK4, even in PC3 prostate cancer cells for which Gray et al reported no change in client levels. Additionally, in HCT116 cells, we showed reduced AKT activity by a decrease in phosphorylation, without changes in total AKT. This is consistent with HSP90/CDC37 protecting AKT from dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Sato et al. 2000</xref>). Additionally, depletion of ERBB2 by CDC37 silencing may also promote phosphatase PP1 activity, which increases AKT dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Xu et al. 2003</xref>). Interestingly, we found that silencing CDC37, like 17-AAG, did not restrict association of the remaining CDK4 with its binding partner cyclin D1 or its inhibitor p21; rather, these interactions were augmented after 5 days suggesting that CDK4 bound to cyclin D1/p21 is less prone to degradation when HSP90/CDC37 chaperoning is disrupted.</p><p id="P30">Pharmacological HSP90 inhibitors induce pleiotropic molecular changes. Thus isolating those fundamental to the antitumour activity is challenging; however, selectively targeting client subsets could reduce redundant or even detrimental effects. We demonstrate here that destabilisation of the CDC37-regulated subset of clients is sufficient to inhibit proliferation of human colon carcinoma cells. Our data suggest that cell proliferation was reduced by restricted S-phase entry, consistent with the observed depletion of CDK4/6 and reduced Rb phosphorylation.</p><p id="P31">In addition, we found that CDC37 silencing sensitised HCT116 colon cancer cells to HSP90 inhibitors VER49009 and 17-AAG by a factor of 2- to 3-fold respectively, as measured by the SRB assay, and also potentiated both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by 17-AAG. A similar trend was seen in the RV22 prostate cancer and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines, albeit to a lesser extent. The sensitisation to HSP90 inhibition in HCT116 cells was likely attributable to the more extensive and prolonged depletion of kinase client proteins when CDC37 was silenced before addition of pharmacological inhibitors. Since CDC37 silencing restricted kinase association with HSP90, and there is evidence that HSP90 is involved in the proteasomal degradation of clients through association with ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Connell et al 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Xu et al, 2002</xref>), it may appear contradictory that kinase clients were subsequently degraded more effectively by HSP90 inhibition after CDC37 silencing. In fact, we show here that both CDC37 silencing and 17-AAG cause a marked decrease in association of the kinase clients studied with HSP90/CDC37, and the combined treatment reduces the interaction further. Similarly, geldanamycin disrupts CRAF binding to CDC37 and HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Grammatikakis et al. 1999</xref>), even though it does not displace CDC37 from HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Siligardi et al. 2002</xref>). It should be noted, however, that salt-labile kinase client-bound HSP90 complexes have been isolated upon exposure to geldanamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Hartson et al 2000</xref>), which may be responsible for proteasome targeting.</p><p id="P32">We demonstrated that, again like 17-AAG treatment, CDC37 silencing induced the proteasome-dependent degradation of kinase clients. Thus, at least in some cases, unchaperoned protein kinase clients may be inherently susceptible to degradation and HSP90/CDC37 may serve to protect these proteins against targeting to the proteasome. Consistent with this view, C/EBP&#x003b1;-mediated disruption of CDK4/CDC37/HSP90 complexes similarly induced CDK4 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Wang et al. 2002</xref>). Studies of Cdc37 in yeast also support a role in protecting kinase clients from proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mandal et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Interestingly, 17-AAG caused an increase in client association with HSC70, indicating that clients may be shifting from HSP90 to HSC70 prior to proteasomal degradation. In contrast, we found that CDC37 silencing did not appear to affect kinase association with HSC70. Therefore, binding to HSC70 may not be important in directing kinase clients for degradation following CDC37 silencing. Of note, combinatorial silencing of HSC70 and HSP72 was similarly found to induce the proteasomal degradation of kinase clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Powers et al. 2008</xref>). Blocking both client recruitment to HSP90 and substrate maturation by combinatorial CDC37 silencing and HSP90 inhibition may consequently drive the degradation of kinase clients via pathways that are either independent of, or dependent on, HSC70. This may provide an explanation for the combinatorial client depletion we observed. Based on our results, a speculative model is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig 8</xref>.</p><p id="P34">An alternative mechanism by which CDC37 silencing might sensitise to HSP90 inhibitors could apply if CDC37 itself was able to protect kinase clients to some extent during pharmacological HSP90 inhibition. Yeast Cdc37 mutants deficient in Hsp90 binding exhibited only limited ability to stabilise clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Lee et al. 2002</xref>). Kinase clients can also be depleted to non-detectable levels by HSP90 inhibitors and there is no conclusive evidence that CDC37 has its own chaperoning activity in mammalian cells. Additionally, only a small fraction of Cdc37 binds Hsp90 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Turnbull et al. 2005</xref>), suggesting that Hsp90-independent functions may be more likely than in mammalian cells where HSP90-bound CDC37 is abundant. We therefore favour the involvement of alternative routes to proteasomal degradation as the mechanism for sensitisation.</p><p id="P35">We have demonstrated that, in contrast to HSP90 inhibitors, CDC37 silencing did not induce HSP72 in any of the cell lines studied, and similarly did not affect expression of other HSF1-regulated genes such as <italic><underline>AHA1</underline></italic> or <italic><underline>HSP90</underline></italic>. Furthermore, 17-AAG-mediated HSP72 induction was unchanged by CDC37 silencing. Thus, in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Gray et al (2007)</xref>, we did not find evidence that CDC37 influences the heat shock response by HSF1 activation. HSP70 induction limits the efficacy of HSP90 inhibitors through its anti-apoptotic role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Guo et al. 2005</xref>). Thus the targeting of CDC37 could be therapeutically advantageous compared with HSP90 inhibitors by avoiding this. Although we did not observe significant apoptosis by silencing CDC37 alone, we measured considerable apoptosis when 17-AAG and CDC37 silencing were combined. This further supports the potential therapeutic value of combinatorial targeting of CDC37 and HSP90.</p><p id="P36">Chemically targeting the CDC37-HSP90 interaction is becoming potentially more feasible with the progressive structural characterisation of HSP90, cochaperone and client interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Vaughan et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Pearl et al. 2008</xref>). Recently, celastrol, which demonstrates anticancer activity, was reported to inhibit CDC37 and HSP90 association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Zhang et al. 2008</xref>). Celastrol exhibits some similarities to HSP90 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hieronymus et al. 2006</xref>), although it is unlikely to act through inhibition of CDC37 alone, since it causes heat shock induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Westerheide et al. 2004</xref>) and proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Yang et al. 2006</xref>). It is nonetheless clear from our studies reported here that CDC37 has considerable potential as a more client-selective alternative for targeting the HSP90 chaperone system, as well as enhancing the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of HSP90 inhibitors. The increased activity and predominant existence of HSP90 in cochaperone-bound complexes in tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kamal et al. 2003</xref>) provides a basis for therapeutic selectivity, as with HSP90 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Workman et al. 2007</xref>). Additionally, the heightened dependence of overexpressed or mutated kinase client proteins on chaperone stabilisation further suggests the potential for increased susceptibility to CDC37 inhibition in malignant versus normal cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S10"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="P37">Human cancer cell lines were obtained from ATCC.

Under normal conditions the kinase is stabilised and/or rendered competent for activation by the ATP-driven HSP90 chaperone cycle, permitting kinase signalling. Treatment with an ATP-competitive HSP90 inhibitor blocks the conformational modification of kinases bound to HSP90, which in an unfolded state may return to an HSC70/HSP40 complex. The association of ubiquitinating enzymes (eg. E3) with HSC70 facilitates polyubiquitination of the unfolded kinase, which is subsequently degraded via the proteasome. (b) By silencing CDC37 expression, the binding of the unstable kinase to HSP90 is reduced. This may leave the unstable kinase prone to factors that directly target it for degradation or it may be ubiquitinated in the HSC70/HSP40 complex which is coupled to the proteasome degradation machinery. Black arrows indicate routes under normal conditions, purple arrows indicate proposed routes during HSP90 inhibition and blue arrows indicate proposed routes during CDC37 silencing.
