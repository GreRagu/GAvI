Neuroblastoma is a fatal childhood cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that frequently overexpresses mitogenic peptides, chemokines and their receptors. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), a cell surface serine protease, inactivates or degrades some of these bioactive peptides and chemokines, thereby regulating cell proliferation and survival. Our studies show that DPPIV is expressed in normal neural crest-derived structures, including superior cervical and dorsal root ganglion cells, sciatic nerve, and in adrenal glands, but its expression is greatly decreased or lost in cells derived from neuroblastoma, their malignant counterpart. Restoration of DPPIV expression in neuroblastoma cells led to their differentiation in association with increased expression of the neural marker MAP2 and decreased expression of chemokines including stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF1) and its receptor CXCR4. Furthermore, DPPIV promoted apoptosis, and inhibited SDF1 mediated <italic>in vitro</italic> cell migration and angiogenic potential. These changes were accompanied by caspase activation, and decreased levels of phospho-AKT and MMP9 activity, down stream effectors of SDF1-CXCR4 signaling. Importantly, DPPIV suppressed the tumorigenic potential of neuroblastoma cells in a xenotransplantation mouse model. These data support a potential role for DPPIV in inhibiting neuroblastoma growth and progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DPPIV</kwd><kwd>Neuroblastoma</kwd><kwd>Apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Chemokine</kwd><kwd>Migration and Invasion</kwd></kwd-group><contract-num rid="RR1">P20 RR016435-076892||RR</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="RR1">National Center for Research Resources : NCRR</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Proteases regulate autocrine and paracrine signaling of growth factors and chemokines, thereby promoting or inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Kenny <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Ghersi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Nanus, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Bauvois, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Carl-McGrath <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bonfil <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Golubkov and Strongin, 2007</xref>).

Indeed, loss or alteration of DPPIV expression is linked to the development of several tumors including prostate, lung, breast, hepatocellular carcinomas, ovarian, and melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Morrison <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Sakamoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Bogenrieder <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Tsuji <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wesley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Independent of its enzymatic activity, DPPIV interacts with extracellular matrix (ECM) components including collagen and fibronectin, thus regulating cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Piazza <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Sedo and Kraml, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Dobers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Havre <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Through these functions, DPPIV regulates diverse biological processes including cell differentiation, adhesion, immune modulation, and apoptosis, functions that control neoplastic transformation. Previously, we and others have shown that DPPIV indeed suppresses the malignant phenotype of melanomas, prostate, ovarian, and lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wesley <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Pethiyagoda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Wesley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wesley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kajiyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). These studies support a role for DPPIV as a tumor suppressor gene.</p><p id="P5">In this study, we report that DPPIV is expressed in normal sympathetic nervous system-derived structures, but its expression and enzymatic activities are greatly decreased in cell lines derived from NB. We further demonstrate that DPPIV re-expression suppresses the malignant phenotype of NB cells, as indicated by inhibition of tumor growth, cell migration, and angiogenesis, in association with induction of apoptosis mediated by caspase activation. DPPIV restoration down-regulated several chemokines including SDF1 and its receptor CXCR4. These changes were accompanied by decreased levels of phospho-AKT, and gelatinase activity of MMP9, which are down stream effectors of SDF1-CXCR4 signaling. These data point to an important role for DPPIV in suppressing NB development and progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Tissues and cell culture</title><p id="P6">Superior cervical and sensory dorsal root ganglia, and sciatic nerve were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA).

Stable restoration of DPPIV cell surface expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These stable cell lines retained the catalytic activity as demonstrated by peptidase enzyme activity ranging from 160-200 pmoles/&#x003bc;g/min protein and was comparable to the normal melanocytes (180-220 pmoles/&#x003bc;g protein/min) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Ba</xref>). Furthermore, RT-PCR clearly indicated that the levels of DPPIV mRNA in transfected cells were similar to the physiological levels seen in normal human adrenal glands (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Bb</xref>). Restoration of DPPIV expression resulted in morphological changes in these cells. Parental and vector transfected SK-N-SH and SK-N-AS cells grew in a disorganized array of focal clumps. In contrast, SK-N-SH and SK-N-AS cells expressing DPPIV for 10-14 days acquired either neuronal-like or larger flat-epithelial-like phenotypes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Ca</xref>). Neurite length was significantly increased in SK-N-SH cells re-expressing DPPIV, indicating neuronal differentiation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Cb</xref>). Changes in phenotype of these cells was associated with increased expression of the neural marker MAP2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Not surprisingly, the proliferation rate was greatly decreased in both cell types as detected by decreased number of viable cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).

Our data show that DPPIV increases sensitivity of SK-N-AS cells to apoptosis in serum withdrawal conditions. Cells undergoing apoptosis exhibited decreased cell size, round morphology, and cellular fragmentation. The proportion of apoptotic cells 3 days following serum withdrawal ranged from 25% to 30% in DPPIV-expressing cells, while the control cells exhibited significantly lower percent (5-7%) of apoptosis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Induction of apoptosis by DPPIV was mediated through activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways as shown by generation of cleaved caspase 8 as well as caspase 9, leading to activation of caspase 3, the downstream effector (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, Akt showed a marked decrease in phosphorylated levels at site Ser 473, in SK-N-AS cells that re-expressed DPPIV compared with control SK-N-AS cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). DPPIV inhibitor diprotin A greatly decreased the DPPIV induced caspase activation and restored the Akt phosphorylation.

In a wound-induced migration assay, control SK-N-AS cells treated with SDF1 migrated to fill the wounded area after 24 hours of wounding, indicating their strong migratory potential. However, restoration of DPPIV greatly reduced this SDF1 mediated migratory potential as indicated by an unfilled wound area after 24 hours (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom panel). Furthermore, the ability of DPPIV expressing SK-N-AS cells to invade through matrigel-coated filters was significantly reduced when compared with control SK-N-AS cells. This effect of DPPIV was blocked by diprotin A pretreatment indicating the specific effects of DPPIV enzyme activity (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Angiogenesis is necessary for tumor cell growth and metastasis. Therefore, we determined the effect of DPPIV on the formation of pro-angiogenic structures arising from HUVEC. Control SK-N-AS cells stimulated the angiogenenic process as indicated by the formation of closed intercellular compartments, while DPPIV re-expressing SK-N-AS cells showed a greatly decreased ability to form closed intercellular compartments and this effect was blocked by DPPIV inhibitor (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Ca</xref>). The length of tubular structures in SK-N-AS+DPPIV cells was significantly shorter than those from control SK-N-AS cells (52% reduction, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Cb</xref>).

However, mice injected with SK-N-AS cells re-expressing DPPIV showed no tumor growth except one animal that developed a tumor at a greatly reduced rate (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This tumor was available for immunohistochemistry. TUNEL assay clearly indicated an increased number of apoptotic cells in the DPPIV-expressing SK-N-AS tumor (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Ba</xref>). Quantification of TUNEL-positive cells revealed significant increase in apoptosis (25-30%) in DPPIV expressing SK-N-AS tumors when compared with control tumor (4-6%) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5Bb</xref>). Furthermore, tumors in control mice were highly angiogenic and showed increased CD31-positivity compared to the tumor developed from SK-N-AS+DPPIV cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).

In order to examine if DPPIV&#x02019;s effects on NB cells (SK-N-AS) are mediated through regulation of chemokines and their receptors, we screened a chemokine pathway-specific PCR array. RNAs from control SK-N-AS and DPPIV re-expressing SK-N-AS cells were analyzed in parallel. Interestingly, DPPIV re-expression resulted in down-regulation of 13 genes, 7 of which were down-regulated more than 5 fold. In contrast, 9 genes that showed up-regulation were changed by only 2-3 fold (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Because SDF1 and CXCR4 showed significant down regulation (24 and 7 fold, respectively), their mRNA and protein levels were further validated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) and immunofluorescence staining (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>).

Recently, cell surface proteases including DPPIV and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) have emerged as important tumor suppressor genes for prostate, ovarian, and lung cancers, as well as hepatocarcinoma and melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wesley <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R66">Wesley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Terauchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R65">Wesley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Kajiyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, the role of cell surface proteases in suppressing NB is virtually unknown. Our studies have shown that DPPIV is expressed in neural crest-derived structures, and in agreement with previous observations in other human neoplasias, DPPIV expression is greatly decreased in NB-derived cells suggesting that DPPIV is a potential tumor suppressor gene for NB. In support of this idea, we have demonstrated that DPPIV indeed suppresses the malignant phenotype of NB cells, characterized by inhibition of survival, migration/invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor growth in nude mice. It is intriguing that a cell surface peptidase can have such pleiotropic effects on the malignant phenotype of NB cells. One possible explanation is that DPPIV degrades or inactivates growth factors and chemokines required for growth and survival of neuroblastic cells. Also, DPPIV may modulate the extracellular microenvironment through its interaction with cell surface receptors and ECM components, thereby providing inhibitory effects on tumor progression.</p><p id="P30">Children with aggressive and metastatic NB are highly refractory to current treatments and have poor survival rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Maris and Woods, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Matthay, 2008</xref>). Thus, further understanding the mechanisms that facilitate aggressive tumor growth and identifying the molecules that inhibit this process is of great importance. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that dysregulation of chemokine-receptor signaling, including SDF1-CXCR4, is associated with growth and metastasis of NB and many other types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Geminder <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Payne and Cornelius, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Barbero <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Balkwill, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Fernandis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Tran <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Belmadani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Burger and Kipps, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Scala <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Guyon and Nahon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Singh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Airoldi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Although, no CXCL12-driven chemotaxis of NB cells was observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Airoldi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, other studies have shown that SDF1-CXCR4 expression correlates with aggressive NB with increased migratory potential and higher vascularity in tumors.

Despite these important observations, the mechanisms responsible for activation of the SDF1-CXCR4 pathway remain elusive.</p><p id="P31">DPPIV is known to regulate the function of certain chemokines. Thus, loss of DPPIV allows accumulation of these chemokines leading to increased interaction with their receptors, and activation of downstream signaling molecules. In support of this view, our studies demonstrate that DPPIV decreases the expression of chemokines in NB cells. Of note, SDF1 and its receptor CXCR4 were down-regulated by more than 5 fold. SDF1 and CXCR4 produced by tumors and stromal cells not only promote migration, but also can stimulate growth, survival, and angiogenesis through activation of survival signaling pathways, and MMP9 required for degradation of nearby matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rundhaug, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67">Zigrino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Raman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In fact, DPPIV re-expressing SK-N-AS cells showed decreased MMP9 activity and exhibited reduced <italic>in vitro</italic> angiogenic and migratory potential. These effects were overcome by pre-treatment with diprotin A that resulted in restoration of MMP9. Diprotin A is a competitive inhibitor of DPPIV enzyme activity and thus it appears that DPPIV enzyme activity is required for suppressing the angiogenic and migratory potential of NB cells. In addition, DPPIV also stimulated an apoptotic cascade by activating caspase 8 and 9 as well as their downstream effector caspase 3. These effects of DPPIV were linked to decreased levels of phospho-AKT, the down stream effectors of SDF1-CXCR4 signaling. Interestingly, DPPIV inhibitor diprotin A greatly blocked the DPPIV induced caspase activation with the increased levels of phosphorylated Akt. Furthermore, evaluation of tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed that inhibited tumor growth of SK-N-AS cells by DPPIV was associated with increased apoptosis and decreased angiogenesis.</p><p id="P32">These functions of DPPIV may be mediated through regulating SDF1-CXCR4 signaling pathway. DPPIV is shown to inactivate SDF1 by proteolytic cleavage. Interestingly, DPPIV also interacts with CXCR4 in hematopoetic cells. However, such interactions have not yet been identified in neuronal cells. Our studies have shown that DPPIV decreases the levels of both SDF1 and its receptor CXCR4. In fact it has been reported that SDF1 not only stimulates CXCR4 signaling but also regulates its expression by positive feed back mechanism. It is possible that in neural crest-derived cells, DPPIV disrupts this positive autocrine signaling loop not only by direct cleavage of SDF1 but also by associating with receptor CXCR4 eventually leading to decreased levels of CXCR4. Independent of its protease activity, DPPIV has other functions, including binding to ECM and other proteins such as CD45, and adenosine deaminase as shown in hematopoetic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Havre <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). It will be of great importance to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which DPPIV regulates SDF1-CXCR4 in NB-derived cells.
