The lesionwas previously subjected to biopsy by his dermatologist withhistologic results of nodular BCC. Chronic epiphora was notnoted. Syringing of the canaliculus by means of a cannula of 25G showed patency of them. Total surgical excision would havecaused a loss of the permeable canaliculus. Hence, intralesionaltreatment with recombinant INF alone was proposed. Afterinformed consent was obtained, INF alpha 2b was injected threetimes a week for three weeks with 1.5 x 10 (6) IU (0.15 ml) perinjection. The total dose received was 13.5 x 10 (6) IU. The lesionpersisted during the follow-up of six months [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>]. Widesurgical resection was then proposed. The histologic study ofthe resected mass confirmed the persistence of nodular BCC.During a year of follow-up no recurrences have been noticed.However, a cicatricial medial ectropion was present.</p><p>We used the same dosage as reported in the first study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>which had 100% success rate for eight cutaneous BCCs aftertwo months of therapy. However, later studies reportedcomplete regression in only 67% of patients with cutaneous BCCtreated with intralesional INF alone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> A 90.9% success rate hasbeen observed in the eyelids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> In this study, the authors usedintralesional INF alpha 2b as an adjunctive treatment after theresection of aggressive BCC and reconstruction. The patient inthe presented case had undergone a prior minor biopsy but nota wide resection. It is possible that a wide resection followedby intralesional INF could attain better satisfactory results inBCC around the canaliculus. Surgical procedures may alsostimulate the immune system and prevent recurrences. We haveobserved the absence of recurrence during follow-up in somecases in which pathology studies revealed involved marginsafter resection. In these cases, intralesional INF alpha 2b maybe a useful adjunctive treatment, as has been proposed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Inconclusion, intralesional INF alpha 2b cannot be the first choicein the treatment of BCC around the canaliculus.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>BE</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Bartley</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemiologic characteristics and clinical course of patients with malignant eyelid tumors in an incidence cohort in Olmstead County, Minesota</article-title><source>Ophthalmology</source><year>1999</year><volume>106</volume><fpage>746</fpage><lpage>50</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10201597</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fenton</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kennedy</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Moriarty</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The role of interferon alpha 2b as an adjunctive treatment in the management of aggressive basal cell carcinoma of the eyelids</article-title><source>Acta Ophthalmol Scand</source><year>2002</year><volume>80</volume><fpage>674</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12485296</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Greenway</surname><given-names>HT</given-names></name><name><surname>Cornell</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanner</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Peets</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Bordin</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagi</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment of basal cell carcinoma with intralesional interferon</article-title><source>J Am Acad Dermatol</source><year>1986</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>437</fpage><lpage>43</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3760271</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chimenti</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Peris</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Di Cristofaro</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fargnoli</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Torlone</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Use of recombinant interferon alpha-2b in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma</article-title><source>Dermatology</source><year>1995</year><volume>190</volume><fpage>214</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7599384</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back><floats-group><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>BCC below the inferior lacrimal canaliculus</p></caption><alt-text>Figure 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="IndianJOphthalmol-56-85-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>BCC six months after treatment with intralesional interferon alpha 2b.
