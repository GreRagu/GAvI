However, the parasite possesses additionally a pyridoxine/pyridoxal kinase (PdxK) to activate B6 vitamers salvaged from the host. We describe a strategy whereby synthetic pyridoxyl-amino acid adducts are channelled into the parasite. Trapped upon phosphorylation by the plasmodial PdxK, these compounds block PLP-dependent enzymes and thus impair the growth of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The novel compound PT3, a cyclic pyridoxyl-tryptophan methyl ester, inhibited the proliferation of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> very efficiently (IC<sub>50</sub>-value of 14 &#x000b5;M) without harming human cells. The non-cyclic pyridoxyl-tryptophan methyl ester PT5 and the pyridoxyl-histidine methyl ester PHME were at least one order of magnitude less effective or completely ineffective in the case of the latter. Modeling <italic>in silico</italic> indicates that the phosphorylated forms of PT3 and PT5 fit well into the PLP-binding site of plasmodial ornithine decarboxylase (<italic>Pf</italic>ODC), the key enzyme of polyamine synthesis, consistent with the ability to abolish ODC activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, the antiplasmodial effect of PT3 is directly linked to the capability of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> to trap this pyridoxyl analog, as shown by an increased sensitivity of parasites overexpressing <italic>Pf</italic>PdxK in their cytosol, as visualized by GFP fluorescence.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria is one of the most threatening diseases in the world, with more than 300 million infected people and up to 2 million fatalities annually, mainly young children and pregnant women living in Africa.

In this respect, not only the search for novel drug targets in the parasite's metabolism but also new approaches should be considered to fight the parasite.</p><p>We propose here a strategy to poison PLP-dependent enzymes in order to kill the human malaria parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.

The idea behind the proposed strategy is hence to target critical PLP-dependent enzymes of the parasite simultaneously by using pyridoxyl-adducts as prodrugs.</p><p>Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004406-Wu2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> showed that the pyridoxyl-histidine methyl ester (PHME) acts as a potent transition-state inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase (hHDC) in human cells. When PHME was applied to cultured <italic>P. falciparum</italic> no significant growth inhibition was observed; similar to the result obtained with the pyridoxine analog deoxypyridoxine, although the latter was previously reported to be an effective inhibitor in a different system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004406-Platzer1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Either these two compounds do not interfere sufficiently with the parasite's metabolism or have only a limited uptake. Since the erythrocyte, the host cell that harbors <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, is regarded as the main carrier of vitamin B6 in the human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004406-Fonda1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, the question arises whether the strategy of poisoning PLP-dependent enzymes in the parasite is at all applicable. However, it was shown that PLP is immediately bound by hemoglobin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004406-Friedrich1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and hence of limited availability for the parasite. It therefore remains to be clarified to what extent the parasite relies on salvage, given that the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of PLP seems to be functional in the blood stage, during which <italic>Plasmodium</italic> can survive without additional pyridoxine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004406-Divo1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study we present the newly synthesized pyridoxyl-tryptophan methyl esters PT3 and PT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004406-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The cyclic PT3 exhibits an antimalarial effect in the low micromolar range, with an IC<sub>50</sub>-value of 14 &#x000b5;M, whereas the non-cyclic PT5 is one order of magnitude less effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004406-g003">Figure 3</xref>). PT3 treatment of human cells revealed only a moderate effect (as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004406-t002">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that the impact of PT3 is parasite-specific. Moreover, effective inhibition of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> at the cellular level with this pyridoxyl-analog demonstrated that <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of PLP is unable to compensate for the adverse effect of PT3 on parasite survival. While we assume that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, there is a dual provision to the parasite's PLP pool, further experiments concerning uptake and functional analyses on knock-out parasites would have to be performed to establish the contributions and relative importance of salvage and <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis.</p><p>As well as demonstrating their antimalarial effect the studies presented here show that both compounds, PT3 and PT5, are phosphorylated by the <italic>Pf</italic>PdxK <italic>in vitro</italic> at levels comparable to those for the natural substrates pyridoxal and pyridoxamine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004406-t001">Table 1</xref>). From this we assume that the pyridoxyl-analogs are likely to be trapped in the parasite. Their trapping in the erythrocyte can be discounted since, beside a PdxK, the host also possesses pyridoxal phosphatase activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004406-Gao1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In order to examine whether the phosphorylated pyridoxyl-amino acid adducts are able to interact with their assumed target enzyme, the inhibitory effect on the plasmodial ODC activity was measured. As expected, only the phosphorylated analogs interfered with the decarboxylation of ornithine to putrescine and were thus able to displace PLP in <italic>Pf</italic>ODC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004406-t001">Table 1</xref>). The fact that pyridoxyl-histidine and -tryptophan inhibit ODC is contrary to the generally accepted view that such transition state inhibitors should be designed only as coenzyme-substrate adducts.</p><p>As PPT3 was not available, its inhibitory action on plasmodial ODC could not be experimentally measured and thus its interaction was studied <italic>in silico</italic>. Molecular modeling of PPT3 and PPT5 in the active site of <italic>Pf</italic>ODC predicted that these would have different binding affinities to the enzyme. PPT3 forms hydrogen bonds with Asp887B and Cys1355A of <italic>Pf</italic>ODC, whilst PPT5 can form only one, with Asp1320 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004406-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The concerted hydrogen bonding of the N atom of the indole ring of PT3 with Asp887B and Cys1355A found in the modelled complex, which results in an additional hydrogen bond in comparison to the complex with PPT5, could account for the better binding of PPT3. Whether this is the main contribution or whether additional energetically favourable interactions are present is beyond the scope of the present modelling studies. Notably, Cys1355A has been assumed to be the catalytic residue in <italic>Pf</italic>ODC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004406-Muller3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, with a function comparable to Cys360 in mammalian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004406-Poulin1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and trypanosomal ODC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004406-Grishin1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, using such compounds as prodrugs against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> had not been tested so far. The strategy proposed here is highly dependent on the phosphorylation by <italic>Pf</italic>PdxK to activate and trap the phosphorylated prodrug in the cell. The key role of <italic>Pf</italic>PdxK could be demonstrated by overexpressing a transgenic copy of <italic>Pf</italic>PdxK in the parasite. By means of a GFP chimera, a cytosolic localization of <italic>Pf</italic>PdxK - important for trapping PT3 - could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004406-g004">Figure 4</xref>). As GFP might disturb the enzyme activity of PdxK, a construct carrying a small strep tag (10 amino acids) instead of GFP (238 amino acids) was also generated. Expression of the <italic>Pf</italic>PdxK-strep fusion product, previously shown to maintain PdxK activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004406-Wrenger1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, was subsequently confirmed by western and northern blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004406-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Since in this case <italic>Pf</italic>PdxK is not the target enzyme but the activator of the prodrug PT3, an increased sensitivity of transgenic <italic>Pf</italic>PdxK overexpressing cells would be expected relative to wild-type. Consistent with the proposed strategy, monitoring parasite growth over several days clearly revealed that the impact of PT3 on <italic>Pf</italic>PdxK overexpressing cells was considerably stronger. The growth rate of these cells was reduced by 61&#x00025; relative to the untreated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004406-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), whereas the proliferation of the wild-type was only inhibited by 19&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004406-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). From that we conclude that a time-dependent accumulation of PPT3 in the parasite's cytosol occurred, emphasizing the key role of <italic>Pf</italic>PdxK.</p><p>Our results suggest that the pyridoxyl-tryptophan derivative enters the parasite, possibly directly via an amino acid transporter.
