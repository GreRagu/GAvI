Although acceptance of an abstract at a large scientificgathering such as the AIOC is prestigious, it is publicationof this research in a peer-reviewed journal that validatesthe significance of these data and methods.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> In addition, thepublication rate of presentations are claimed to be the indicatorof the level of scientific quality of a meeting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></p><p>We sought to determine the completeness of reporting ofpapers presented at the AIOC in the year 2000, the proportionthat were ultimately published in peer-reviewed journals anddifferences between the presented paper and that publishedin a journal, if any.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Using the proceedings of the AIOC, the full text of paperspresented at the annual conference of the All IndiaOphthalmological Society in 2000 was obtained. The year 2000was chosen to allow sufficient time for the presented papersto reach publication. Both authors independently assessedeach proceedings paper for completeness of reporting thatincluded the following key features: whether the authorsprovided adequate correspondence details, dates defining theperiod of study, objectives stated clearly enough to measurethe outcomes, appropriate study design, appropriate statisticalmethods and adequate results. For randomized clinical trials(RCT) in addition to the features mentioned above, we assessedwhether the authors provided details of the method of randomallocation, sample size calculation and allocation concealmentand masking. A score of 1 was given for each feature that wasappropriately described; based on the features assessed, themaximum possible score varied with the study design. It was5 for a descriptive paper, 6 for an observational or experimentalstudy and 9 for a RCT. To make them comparable across thestudy designs, the scores were standardized by dividing theactual score by the maximum score possible for that studydesign and multiplying by 10. A score of 10 was taken toindicate a methodologically sound paper.</p><p>To determine if completeness of reporting had changed withtime, papers of the proceedings of 2000 were compared withmore recent proceedings (2006). For this purpose, 100 out of 264papers were chosen from the proceedings of 2006. We settledon 100 papers instead of the whole 264 for several reasons. Theprimary outcome measure was completeness of reporting inthe proceedings of 2000; review of papers for completeness ofreporting was time consuming; 100 was a statistically validnumber to compare with 200. To avoid bias of subspecialty,we included the first five papers of the first 20 subspecialtiespublished in the proceedings of 2006.</p><p>To determine subsequent full publication, a detailedcomputerized search of articles indexed by <italic>Index Medicus</italic>was performed using the PubMed server as of January 2007.Therefore, the evaluation period extended for a maximumof 7 years. Appropriate key words from the title combinedwith each author&#x02032;s name were used in order to identify thecorresponding publication. In case a hit was not obtained, theprocess was repeated with each author, groups of authors andfinally with all authors. A published manuscript was consideredto be a full publication of a proceedings paper when it satisfiedboth of the following criteria: (i) at least one of the authors ofthe proceedings paper was an author of the publication and(ii) at least one of the outcomes from the proceedings paperwas an outcome of the publication.</p><p>The data were recorded independently by both authors. Thetype of journal (national or international; ophthalmological orother), month and year of publication, time lag to publication,number of authors, sample size, geographical location ofthe study, organization of origin (medical college or other),design of the study (descriptive, observational or experimental[RCT or non-RCT]) and subspecialty (as categorized inthe proceedings) were noted. Both authors independentlyrecorded any differences between the proceedings paper andthe published version with regard to sample size, analysismethods, results, number of authors and change in authorshipsequence or names. The authors of this article were not maskedto the authors and institutions. In case of discrepancy in thefindings between the two authors, the results were discussedto determine the type of difference, if any. When it pertained todifference in the type of journal, month and year of publication,number of authors, sample size, geographical location andorganization of origin of the study, completeness score,subspecialty and difference between the proceedings paper andthe published version, the proceedings or the published paperwas revisited and the discrepancy appropriately corrected.When it pertained to design of the study, the decision of thestatistical author was final.</p><p>The data were entered into an Excel spreadsheet andthe mean, standard deviation, and range for each categorywere determined. Univariate significance testing with thechi square test and Fisher&#x02032;s exact test was used to comparecompleteness of reporting in the Proceedings 2000 with thatin Proceedings 2006 and to determine whether there weresignificant differences between papers with completenessscores of 10/10 and those with lower scores, in publicationrates and study design. Univariate significance testing wasalso used to determine if there were significant differencesin publication rates based on geographical location of thestudy, organization of origin, subspecialty and study design.To determine influence of geographical region of the study,study design, and subspecialty on subsequent publication inan indexed journal, we computed the <italic>P</italic>-value and odds ratioby comparing one category with all other categories combined,making a two-by-two contingency table.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> One-way ANOVAwith Tukey test was used to compare completeness scoresbased on geographical region and subspecialty.

A largemajority of studies failed to include the dates of the study,description of study design or statistical methods employed[<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. In comparison, the Proceedings of 2006 showedsignificant improvement in reporting of objectives and studydesign, while correspondence details were less likely to bereported. Of the 200 papers in the Proceedings of 2000, 13were RCT; none of these gave information on methods usedto generate the random allocation, calculate sample size ormethods for allocation concealment and masking.</p><p>Scores for completeness are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>; when the 13RCTs were considered, scores were low and ranged between3.3 and 6.7 (average 4.9 &#x000b1; 0.97). Only 14 (7%) papers scored 10out of 10 points for completeness. These included five of alldescriptive studies, seven of all observational and two of allexperimental studies (12.5%, 14.6%, and 1.8%, respectively;<italic>P</italic> = 0.004). Their publication rates were comparable withpapers that had lower scores (<italic>P</italic> = 0.18). Ninety-three papersoriginated from medical colleges and 107 from privatecenters. Completeness scores were comparable regardlessof organization of origin (<italic>P</italic> = 0.21). Papers from South Indiahad significantly higher completeness scores than those fromthe West (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03), all other regions being comparable. Whensubspecialty was considered, papers from the uvea session hadsignificantly higher scores than those from refractive surgery(<italic>P</italic> = 0.03), all other subspecialties being comparable.</p><p>Thirty-three (16.5%) of the papers published in Proceedings2000 were subsequently published as 34 papers in journalsindexed by <italic>Index Medicus</italic> by January 2007 (within 7 yearsof presentation; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Twelve papers were published inindexed national journals; 10 (83.3%) of them in an ophthalmicjournal. Twenty-two papers were published in indexedinternational journals (one study was published in two journals,each reporting different aspects); 19 (86.4%) were ophthalmicjournals. Time from presentation to publication for 31 papersranged from 2 to 77 months (average 22.8 &#x000b1; 16.4 months, median20 months); the majority were published in the first 3 years ofpresentation [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Three papers were published 1 month,5 months, and 6 months before they were presented.</p><p>The number of authors in papers published in theproceedings varied from 1 to 9 (average 3.5 &#x000b1; 1.7); those thatwere not subsequently published in indexed journals had anaverage of 3.4 &#x000b1; 1.6 authors, while those that were publishedhad 4.1 &#x000b1; 1.8 authors on an average (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02). The samplesize in papers published in the proceedings varied from 1 to7733 (average 219 &#x000b1; 736, median 60); those that were notsubsequently published in indexed journals had an averagesample size of 214.3 &#x000b1; 774.3, while it was 244.3 &#x000b1; 511.9 in thosethat were published (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07).</p><p>The majority of presentations at the conference were byauthors from South and North India. However, geographicallocation did not influence the rate of subsequent publication in anindexed journal [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>]. Publication rate was not influenced bythe organization of origin (<italic>P</italic> = 0.31). Experimental studies werethe most common study design but their publication rates werenot significantly different from other study designs [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>].Of the 13 RCTs, three (23.1%) were published as full papers.There was no difference in publication rates between RCTs andnon-RCT experimental studies (<italic>P</italic> = 0.39). Presentations dealingwith glaucoma were significantly more likely to be subsequentlypublished in an indexed journal [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>].</p><p>The published version differed from the proceedings paperin 27 (81.8%) instances. The types of differences are depicted in[<xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">Table 8</xref>]; they were mostly related to changes in author name,number or sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>A look at the abstract book of AIOC 2000 shows that 278abstracts were submitted as free papers for the conference. Thatonly 200 were published in the proceedings indicates that manyauthors either did not eventually present or did not submit afull version for the proceedings. Papers presented at scientificmeetings have one important purpose: to disseminate researchfindings as soon as possible. However, medical scientists havequestioned the quality of such presentations, as many are notreported in sufficient detail to enable judgments to be madeabout the validity of their results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> Our study too revealsthat details of study design were available in only aboutone-third of the proceedings papers in the year 2000; evenfewer experimental studies reported the statistical methodsemployed. Moreover, authors of RCTs omitted to mention themethods used to generate randomization, calculate sample size,allocation concealment, and masking. Thus, scientists desirousof duplicating the methodology in their own set-up would nothave access to sufficient information. To compound the issue,correspondence details were missing from 20% of the studies,making it difficult for others to contact researchers for moreinformation. The situation was not much better in the year 2006,when study design, though reported significantly more often,was still not available in half of the studies and correspondencedetails were missing from one-third.</p><p>When completeness scores were considered, only 7%papers scored 10/10; experimental studies, both RCTs andnon-RCTs were significantly poorly reported. Poor reportingin the proceedings did not influence publication rates andwas not related to organization of origin of the paper. Thus,it may simply have resulted from a casual attitude by theresearchers towards the version published in the proceedingsas opposed to the presented version of the paper. On the otherhand, it may be a reflection of unsound methodology. Eitherway, these findings assume significance as practitioners maychoose to alter their clinical practice based on results presentedat scientific meetings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Thus, researchers should interpretinformation presented at meetings with caution. Conferenceorganizers could provide clearer guidelines, which outline thekey elements that must be reported in all studies.</p><p>The subsequent rate of publication of papers presented at theAIOC 2000 (16.5%) was much lower than that reported by otherspecialty conferences (33-44.6%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> To avoid a temporal bias,we considered only those conferences for comparison, whichhad been conducted at about the same time (between 1998 and2001) as the AIOC 2000. However, none of these &#x02032;other specialty&#x02032;conferences were conducted in India. A Medline literaturesearch did not reveal any article assessing publication rates ofpapers presented at conferences in India. Since publication ratesmay be influenced by geographical region of origin of the article,it may not be appropriate to compare publication rates acrossthe globe.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> Recent studies show that thepublication rates continue to largely vary between 25 and 68%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> however, some specialty conferences report rates that are higher than 80%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> These authors conclude that high publication rates reflect wellon the abstract selection process and the scientific quality of themeeting. Caution is advised when referencing or generalizingfrom abstracts that have not been published in full.</p><p>To improve the quality of meetings, scientific committeesshould be encouraged to be more selective.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>However, since the number of papers submitted each year for presentationkeeps increasing, it presumably makes the selection processmore difficult.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> Simultaneously, investigators should beencouraged to publish their data after presentation. It hasbeen suggested that failure to publish an adequate account ofa well-designed clinical trial is a form of scientific misconductthat can lead those caring for patients to make inappropriatetreatment decisions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></p><p>Though the AIOC publication rates were low, the time lagto publication was comparable to other studies; most werepublished within the first 3 years of presentation, usuallyin a journal of the same specialty.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> It has been suggestedthat presenters need help in submitting and publishing theirwork.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> To that end, the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology, beingthe only national, indexed, ophthalmic journal, could offerfurther peer review and guidance to conference papers afterpresentation in an effort to encourage researchers to publish.More papers (nearly two-thirds) were subsequently publishedin international journals as opposed to Indian journals. Perhaps,impact factor of the journal prompted researchers to choose onejournal over another. There are several specialty ophthalmicjournals available in the international scenario as seen from<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. It is likely that researchers working in a particularspecialty prefer to send their papers to a journal specializingin that topic. Finally, the prestige attached to an internationalpublication may have influenced the choice of journal. Thesefactors were not specifically studied and may form the basisfor future research.</p><p>Though the difference in average number of authorsbetween proceedings papers that were subsequently publishedand those that were not is only about half an author, it wasstatistically significant. The significance is possibly becauseof the large range (between 1 and 9 authors per paper). Otherreports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> have also found that papers with a larger author bylineare significantly more likely to be published in an indexedjournal. Presumably, having more authors on the byline ensuresthat one or the other carries the paper to full publication.</p><p>Subspecialties providing the largest number of abstractshave higher publication rates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> However, in the AIOC,although cataract and retinal subspecialties provided thelargest volume of presentations, studies dealing with glaucomawere more likely to be published. We were unable to explainthis discrepancy. Completeness of reporting was not deemed tobe responsible as scores were comparable for all subspecialtiesexcept uvea, which had the most methodologically soundpapers and refractive surgery, which had the worst. Perhaps,glaucoma research requires a more sophisticated set-upthat might co-exist with an awareness or requirement forpublication of research results. However, the same may be truefor other specialties like retina or squint.</p><p>Authors report that randomized or controlled clinicaltrials are more likely to be published.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> However, ourstudy found that they were published at the same rate as non-RCT experimental studies. Since large clinical trials are thestandard for making treatment decisions, the consequencesof non-publication of the results of trials are significant; non-publication can lead to bias in the literature and contributeto inappropriate medical decisions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref> Sample size was notpredictive of publication in our study. Sample size wasextremely variable, ranging between one case and severalthousands, perhaps accounting for its lack of importance.</p><p>Researchers from South India had higher completenessof reporting scores than those from the West. However,geographical location did not affect publication rates. Perhaps,a larger sample size could bring out statistically significantgeographical differences in publication rates. This studyalso highlights that there are geographical differences in thenumber of papers presented at the conference. This may inpart be due to the fact that the conference was held in SouthIndia, but if confirmed, the All India Ophthalmological Societycould consider measures to rectify this regional disparity.Publication rates were not influenced by organization oforigin. This probably is an indication that researchers in privateinstitutions are under some pressure to publish, no differentfrom researchers in medical colleges.</p><p>Differences between the paper presented at the AIOC 2000and the version published in an indexed journal were foundin more than 80% instances. This figure is much higher thanthat reported in other studies (18-59%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> However, thetype of difference varies between studies. The most commondiscrepancy seen in our study was in the author byline, with81.4% of papers having replaced one or more proceedings&#x02032;authors with new ones. Other studies have shown that changein author names and number is not uncommon.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> Suchchanges may result from pressure to grant gift authorship topersons in a position of relative power; persons who mightotherwise cause conflict or mar the chances of presentationor publication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref> On the other hand, it is possible that authorscontribute to the presentation but not to the actual researchand publication, or have moved on and are difficult to trace.It might be logical and helpful to apply the same authorshipcriteria to conference presentations as are required forindexed publications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref> Though seen infrequently in our study,differences in study design, results and outcomes have beenseen to occur in 10-19% of papers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref> Suchdifferences may result when investigators fail to review and carefully reporttheir work at the time of abstract submission owing to thepressure of submission deadlines. Moreover, results may bepoorly interpreted at the time of presentation. On the otherhand, investigators tend to be more careful when submittingdata for publication in peer-reviewed journals, while somechanges in the data occur during the peer-review process dueto editing by the editorial staff of journals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Some changesbetween the presented and the published paper may resultfrom audience feedback at the conference, which possibly helpsimprove the quality of the finished study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></p><p>There were some limitations in the present study. It ispossible that we missed articles published more than 7 yearsafter the AIOC 2000. Moreover, we restricted our search toMedline-indexed journals and may have missed some articlespublished in journals that are not indexed in Medline. We didnot specifically go into the reasons for conference presentationsfailing to get published in indexed journals. Other studiessuggest that presented material may not be published, asinvestigators do not submit them for publication or because thework is not scientifically valid and may not meet the scrutinyof the peer-review process required for full publication.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref> One possible reason that scientists do not publish theirpresentation material in indexed journals is that they need thepresentation only to be allowed to attend and be reimbursed forthe conference. They may not be interested in doing anythingfurther with the data after that. This speculation is supported bythe fact that 278 abstracts were selected for presentation at theAIOC 2000, but only 200 were published in the proceedings.</p><p>While the proceedings are an appropriate measure tostudy, they are at best a surrogate for the presentations atthe conference. Thus, the actual presentations may be totallydifferent and may not be reflected in the print version thatfollows (proceedings and publications). However, since theactual presentation content is impossible to revisit at a laterdate, it is the proceedings that other researchers will access;this makes it imperative that presenters give the same attentionto the version they submit for the proceedings as they give tothe presentation.</p><p>We conclude that the overall quality of reporting of scientificpapers in the proceedings of the AIOC 2000 was inadequateand many did not go on to publication in an indexed journal.Differences between the published paper in a journal and inthe proceedings were common. Ophthalmologists shouldbe cautious about using information provided in conferenceproceedings in their ophthalmic practice.</p><p>Guidelines to scientific committees for more rigorousselection of abstracts could improve the reporting of studies andincrease the publication rate.
