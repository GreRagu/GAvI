Uncontrolled cell proliferation, which is associated with the loss of the proper cell cycle control, is a prominent feature in these cancers. The cell cycle is controlled by a highly conserved family of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and their regulatory subunits cyclins. Among the cyclins, cyclin B1 plays a pivotal role as a regulatory subunit for Cdk1, which is indispensable for the transition from G2 phase to mitosis. Overexpression of cyclin B1 has been reported in various human tumors, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and its upregulation is closely associated with poor prognosis in various types of cancers including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Moreover, overexpression of cyclin B1 is involved in the resistance to radiotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and nuclear cyclin B1-positive breast carcinomas are resistant to adjuvant therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. More recently, it is reported that both antibodies and T cells are generated in response to aberrant cyclin B1 expression in tumors like breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], indicating that overexpressed cyclin B1 could serve as one of the signals to initiate the communication between cancer cells and their microenvironment.</p><p>The mechanisms accounting for overexpressed cyclin B1 are not yet totally understood. It has been reported that the tumor suppressors p53 and BRCA1 negatively regulate the promoter of cyclin B1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], whereas the oncogene c-Myc positively regulates the expression of cyclin B1 in cooperation with the loss of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The promoter of cyclin B1 is also upregulated by 17beta-estradiol (E2), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and prolactin-releasing hormone (PRL), which are considered as the factors contributing to mammary cancer development and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Moreover, cyclin B1 mRNA is significantly stabilized in cervical cancer cells infected with human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV 18) through upregulating HuR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], a ubiquitously expressed member of the Hu family of RNA-binding proteins.</p><p>The highly expressed cyclin B1, even in G1 phase, binds to its partner Cdk1, which phosphorylates a series of substrates regardless of the cell cycle phase and contributes to the aggressive proliferation in neoplastic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, overexpression of cyclin B1 is related to aneuploidy and high proliferation of human mammary carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This is consistent with the observation of cyclin B1 overexpression enabling cells to override the G2 DNA damage checkpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Nuclear cyclin B1, together with Cdk1AF, a Cdk1 mutant that cannot be phosphorylated at its inhibitory sites, induced a striking premature mitotic phenotype even after DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], resulting in accumulation of genomic defects, one hallmark of neoplastic development. More strikingly, enforced expression of cyclin B1 induces tetraploidy, either after mitotic spindle inhibition of nocodazole or in the absence of such inhibition if cyclin B1 is coexpressed with c-Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, deregulation of cyclin B1 is involved in neoplastic transformation and promotes proliferation of tumor cells. Conversely, downregulation of cyclin B1, consequently reducing the activity of Cdk1/cyclin B1, could block the aggressive proliferation of tumor cells. Indeed, our previous data confirm that interfering with cyclin B1 function inhibits proliferation of human tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In the present study, we focus on gynecological cancer cell lines and investigate the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) induced cyclin B1 knockdown on tumor cell proliferation. Interestingly, the combination of cyclin B1 siRNA with taxol substantially enhanced the inhibitory effect on proliferation of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, while control HeLa cells were progressively growing, the tumor growth of HeLa cells treated with cyclin B1 siRNA prior to inoculation was strongly inhibited in nude mice, indicating cyclin B1 is indispensable for tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture, reagents and cell synchronization</title><p>Cervical cancer cell line HeLa and breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, BT-474, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 were obtained from DSMZ (Braunschweig).

To study the function of cyclin B1 in breast cancer cells we selected cancer cell lines MCF-7, BT-474, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231, as they represent the best characterized cell lines for breast cancer research. While MCF-7 and BT-474 express both estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR), SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cells lack those receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Unlike SK-BR-3 and BT-474, which are Her-2/<italic>neu</italic>-positive, MCF-7 cells only exhibit a basal level of Her-2/<italic>neu </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, MCF-7 cells express high amounts of markers typical of the luminal epithelia phenotype of breast cells, whereas BT-474 and SK-BR-3 cells exhibit a weakly luminal epithelia-like phenotype. Distinct from the two phenotypes above, MDA-MB-231 represents a highly invasive &#x0201c;mesenchymal-like&#x0201c; breast cancer cell line by expressing a high level of vimentin. In addition, the cervical cancer cell line HeLa was selected, because it represents the most extensively studied cancer cell line thus far.</p><sec><title>Specific downregulation of cyclin B1 with siRNA</title><p>We were at first interested whether breast cancer cell lines are similarly sensitive to specific downregulation of cyclin B1 by siRNA. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, while the protein level of cyclin B1 in MDA-MB-231 was almost undetectable after treatment with siRNA1 or siRNA3, 33% and 16% of cyclin B1 were still detectable in MCF-7 cells after treatment with siRNA1 and siRNA3, respectively, relative to the protein level of cyclin B1 in control cells. In contrast to cyclin B1, &#x003b2;-actin was not affected. The protein level of Cdk1, the catalytic partner of cyclin B1, hardly changed, indicating cyclin B1 knockdown by siRNAs was specific. Treatment of BT-474 and SK-BR-3 cells with siRNA1 and siRNA3 also reduced cyclin B1 levels, albeit to a lower extent as compared to MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Downregulation of cyclin B1 was also corroborated by indirect immunofluorenscence staining with monoclonal specific antibodies against cyclin B1 (data not shown). Furthermore, in consistence with downregulation of cyclin B1 protein, the kinase activity of Cdk1/cyclin B1 was decreased to 28% in cellular extracts from siRNA1-treated BT-474 cells as compared to siGFP-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

In order to explore cyclin B1 knockdown as a possible combination with taxol, we transfected MCF-7 cells with siRNA3 and followed by further incubation with taxol. Cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection. As depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, cyclin B1 protein level was strongly reduced after siRNA3 treatment. Cyclin B1 level was also decreased after treatment with taxol at a low dosage of 3 ng/ml, possibly due to the induction of apoptosis, and almost disappeared when cells were pre-treated with siRNA3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, upper panel). Indeed, PARP (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) was cleaved in cells treated with taxol and more strongly cleaved when siRNA3 was used together with taxol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, middle panel), indicating that the combined treatment triggers more robust apoptotic response. In addition, proliferation was inhibited to a higher extent after the combined treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The results were further correlated with the cell cycle analysis: a G2/M population was more prominent in MCF-7 cells after the combined treatment, compared to cells exposed to siRNA3 alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The data indicate that the combined therapy activates more strongly caspase-3 independent apoptotic pathways in MCF-7 cells as the <italic>caspase-3 </italic>gene is deleted in MCF-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Similar results were also obtained in MDA-MB-231 cells: while siRNA3 or taxol alone reduced proliferation by 33% and 31%, respectively, relative to siGFP treatment, the combination of siRNA3 with taxol resulted in a 65% reduction of proliferation (data not shown). Thus, the combined action of cyclin B1 knockdown together with taxol enhances antiproliferative and proapoptotic responses in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we investigated the combination of knockdown of cyclin B1 with irradiation. Irradiation enhanced the G2/M population and induced more apoptosis in cyclin B1 reduced MCF-7 cells, compared to control cells (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>More sensitive to taxol in MCF-7 cells with reduced cyclin B1</bold>.

Despite these advances, these cancers remain major clinical problems by causing considerable morbidity and mortality in women worldwide. Apart from the standard approaches, novel potent molecular agents for anticancer therapy are in great demand.</p><p>In this communication we show that the knockdown of cyclin B1, the regulatory subunit of Cdk1, inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in various breast and cervical cancer cell lines. Importantly, siRNA mediated cyclin B1 knockdown in combination with chemotherapeutical agent taxol, enhanced the antiproliferative effect on breast cancer cells. Interestingly, the reduction of cyclin B1 in MCF-7 cells impaired colony-forming ability, a hallmark of malignancy in tumor cells. Moreover, while control HeLa cells were progressively growing, the tumor growth of HeLa cells treated with siRNA targeting cyclin B1 prior to inoculation was strongly inhibited in nude mice, indicating cyclin B1 is indispensable for tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken together, the data strengthen the notion of cyclin B1 being required for the survival and proliferation of breast and cervical cancer cells and depletion/downregulation of cyclin B1 inhibits proliferation of cancer cells <italic>in vitro </italic>as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Recent genetic evidence demonstrates that Cdk1 is the only Cdk sufficient to drive the mammalian cell cycle because embryos from Cdk1<sup>-</sup>/<sup>- </sup>mice fail to develop to the morula and blastocyst stages, whereas mouse embryos lacking all interphase Cdks (Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4 and Cdk6) undergo organogenesis and develop to midgestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. These data underscore that Cdk1 is essential for cell cycle regulation and a major force driving cell proliferation. Cyclin B1, the regulatory subunit of Cdk1, controls the activity of Cdk1 as it associates with and thereby activates Cdk1, regulates its nuclear translocation and passively mediates its inactivation when cyclin B1 is degraded at anaphase transition. Cyclin B1 is fundamental for cell proliferation. Uncontrolled expression of cyclin B1 is associated with neoplastic transformation and gynecological cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Overexpression of cyclin B1 is believed to confer therapy resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, targeting cyclin B1, leading consequently to the inactivation of Cdk1, could be a promising specific strategy for cell cycle intervention against breast and cervical cancer.</p><p>In this work, as a proof-of-concept, the RNA interference was used to downregulate/deplete cyclin B1 and a clear antiproliferative effect was observed in all cancer cell lines studied. Among the breast cancer cell lines investigated, MCF-7 cells exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on cell proliferation after cyclin B1 siRNA treatment, followed by MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which possibly correlates with the cyclin B1 level in exponential growing status of each cell line (data not shown). Although the protein level of cyclin B1 in MDA-MB-231 cells was nearly undetectable after siRNA1 or siRNA3 transfection, the inhibitory impact was moderate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), suggesting the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells is not necessarily dependent on the normal level of cyclin B1 and the little amount of remaining cyclin B1 might be sufficient for the survival of MDA-MB-231 cells. Finally, SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells were also not as sensitive to siRNA treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) as HeLa or MCF-7 cells. This could be due to the cellular context of SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells, e.g. Her-2/<italic>neu</italic>+, which very often leads to a hormone-independent proliferation of cells. Thus, unlike in MCF-7 cells, targeting Her-2/<italic>neu </italic>or other factors promoting G1/S transition could be more effective for inhibiting cell cycle progression in SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells, which has been shown by our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. On that account, specific targeting of oncogene(s) in individual cancer cell lines, like Her-2/<italic>neu </italic>in SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells, or cyclin B1 in MCF-7, could improve breast cancer therapy. Collectively, downregulation/depletion of cyclin B1 worked effectively in all gynecological cancer cell lines tested. However, only in some cell lines, such as MCF-7 and HeLa, cyclin B1 knockdown resulted in a strong proliferative inhibition, most likely because proliferation in those cell lines is more dependent on high cyclin B1 levels as compared to other cell lines.</p><p>Taxane drugs represent the most important class of anticancer agents and are integrated in multidrug-regiments for the therapy of several solid tumors including gynecological cancers. Despite their relevant contribution in ameliorating the quality of life and overall survival of cancer patients, drug resistance and site-effects hamper its wide usage. Therefore, it is desirable to find new ways of lowering drug dosage without losing effectiveness to limit side-effects and possibly also to slow down drug resistance. In this work, cyclin B1 siRNA in combination with taxol, blocking entry into mitosis and targeting the transition of metaphase to anaphase, respectively, demonstrated a high efficacy in inhibiting proliferation of MCF-7 cells. The data suggest that specific targeting of cyclin B1 could sensitize some gynecological cancer cells, like MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, to conventional chemotherapeutic agents like taxol, thereby reducing their side-effects by lowering their dosage.</p><p>Taken together, the data from this work further strengthen the notion that cyclin B1 could be an attractive target for potential anticancer therapy. Inhibiting cyclin B1 function in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs could reinforce the antiproliferative effect in a subset of cancers. As RNA interference still faces the major challenge of systematic delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], an alternative strategy could be small molecule inhibitors targeting cyclin B, as its crystal structure is recently published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In parallel to Cdk inhibitors, which have been extensively under clinical investigations, small molecule inhibitors against cyclin B1 could open up a new door for specific molecular cancer therapy by interfering with its protein stability, binding capacity to Cdk1 or its subcellular localization.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work demonstrates that cyclin B1 is required for survival and proliferation of breast and cervical cancer cells.
