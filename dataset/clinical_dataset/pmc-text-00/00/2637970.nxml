Replacement of infarcted heart tissue with regenerating myocardium from endogenous progenitor pools or exogenously introduced stem cells remains a therapeutic ideal. Their impracticality mainly lies in their low efficiency in cardiogenic differentiation (CD). Our recent studies with an acute MI animal model have already demonstrated the therapeutic effect of the MeOH extract of <italic>Geum japonicum</italic> (EGJ), providing clear evidence of myocardial regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>The present study further isolated the active component contained in EGJ using bioassay-guided isolation and investigated its efficacy in the treatment of infarcted heart in animal MI models. We demonstrated that substantial repair of infarcted heart in animal MI models by EGJ can be mimicked by the isolated candidate compound (cardiogenin) in MI animal models. Clear evidence of newly regenerated endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived cardiomyocytes was observed throughout the infarct zone, accompanied by significantly improved functional performance of the heart. Transplantation of MSCs pretreated with EGJ or cardiogenin into a MI animal model also resulted in substantial regeneration of functional myocardium, implying that the activated MSCs carry all the necessary blueprints for myocardial regeneration. Signaling pathways specific to cell survival, CD identified in embryonic heart induction and angiogenesis were activated in both cardiogenin-treated MSCs and cardiogenin-induced regenerating myocardium.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has demonstrated the therapeutic effects of cardiogenin in infarcted heart repair, and identified the associated signalling pathways for effective cardiogenic differentiation of MSCs, cell survival and angiogenesis. These findings should enable new treatment strategies for MI to be developed immediately.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite significant therapeutic advances, replacement of infarcted heart tissue with regenerating myocardium remains a therapeutic ideal as it is almost impossible for adult cardiomyocytes to repopulate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Leferovich1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Orlic1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The recent observation that a population of myocytes within the myocardium can replicate after infarction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Beltrami1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> has triggered an intense search for progenitor cells that can replace damaged myocardium. Transplantation of cardiomyocytes or myoblasts have both failed to reconstitute functional myocardium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Yoo1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Taylor1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Transplantation of adult bone marrow (BM) derived MSCs following MI has been shown to produce some cardiomyogenesis, but majority of the newly regenerated cardiomyocytes appeared to be scattered along the less-ischemic border zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Mangi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Orlic1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. This signifies that the transplanted MSCs had insufficient CD to form the integrated units necessary for regenerating functional myocardium. Considerable efforts have therefore been focused on searching for new ways to enhance cardiogenic differentiation efficiency (CDE) from a variety of potential progenitor cells, including embryonic stem cells, hemotopoietic stem cells and MSCs, since this is essential for myocardial regeneration as a viable and practical therapy for MI. However, the molecular mechanisms by which candidate progenitors can be stimulated to differentiate into cardiomyocytes remain largely unknown. An alternative solution is to search for molecules that can devise mechanisms which increase CDE in endogenous candidate progenitors.</p><p>In search of molecules promoting CDE, it is surprising to learn that the Miao, an ethnic group in China's Guizhou province, live significantly longer than other ethnic groups inhabiting the same region. A possible explanation for their longevity is that for centuries they have used their own kind of traditional medicine, which differs considerably from traditional Chinese medicine. We therefore screened the herbs frequently used in Miao medicine for treating common diseases that might possibly contribute to their longevity. One potential candidate was <italic>Geum japonicum</italic>, a herb used as a diuretic and an astringent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Perry1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> in Chinese medicine, but is also one of the commonly used herbs in many Miao medicine formulas. Our recent studies with an acute MI animal model have already demonstrated the therapeutic effect of EGJ, providing clear evidence of myocardial regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Li1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings have prompted the present investigation for the identification and isolation of the active components of EGJ, demonstration of its therapeutic effect for MI and elucidation of possible underlying signaling mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal experiment protocols conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and approved by the Animal Experimental Ethical Committee of The Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Bio-assay Guided Isolation of Cardiogenin from <italic>Geum Japonicum</italic></title><p><italic>Geum japonicum</italic> collected from the Guizhou Province of China in August was dried, cut and percolated with 70&#x00025; MeOH at room temperature for 6 days.

The hearts of the sacrificed rats were removed and washed with PBS. All the specimens harvested were either sectioned for histological and immunohistochemical analyses or used for Western blot and DNA microarray studies. For histological examination, the left ventricles of the experimental rats sacrificed on day 7 and 14 were removed and cut from apex-to-base in 3 transverse slices and embedded in paraffin. The infarct size and vascular density in infarct zones were measured accordingly. Infarct size was expressed as a percentage of the total left ventricular area. To quantify the average number of capillaries in central infarct zones, 16 sections from within the central infarct zone of each heart were analysed, in which capillaries were counted and averaged in 6 randomly selected high power view fields (HPF, 40&#x000d7;) on each section. Blinded capillary counts were performed on 6&#x02013;8 hearts per group by two investigators. The results were expressed as mean&#x000b1;SD capillaries per HPF. The detailed procedures for identification of the regenerating cardiomyocytes and myocardium; determination of the total volume of regenerating myocardium for hearts in each group; and related immunohistochemical analyses conducted in this study have been described in our previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Li1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Construction of Myosin Light Chain 2v-Promoted EGFP (MLC-GFP) Plasmid and its Transfection to MSCs</title><p>A recombinant expression vector was constructed by cloning a 2.7 kb HindIII&#x02013;EcoRI fragment of the rat MLC-2v promoter region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Taylor1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> into the HindIII&#x02013;EcoRI site of pEGFP-1 plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to form a MLC-GFP plasmid, allowing GFP expression to be controlled by the MLC-2v promoter. To validate the construction, the pEGFP-1 plasmid and the constructed MLC-GFP plasmid with rat MLC-2v promoter were transfected to MSCs respectively. The non-transfected MSCs, transfected MSCs with a pEGFP-1 plasmid, and MSCs with a MLC-GFP plasmid were then treated with cardiogenin respectively. The results derived from this validation experiment demonstrated that (i) although cardiogenin-treated non-transfected MSCs showed an elongated phenotype compared to non-phenotypic changes in sham-treated cells, no GFP expression was observed, indicating that no endogenous GFP was stimulated; (ii) although cardiogenin-treated and sham-treated pEGFP-1 transfected MSCs underwent different phenotypic changes, both the cardiogenin-treated and sham-treated cells expressed GFP; (iii) a much higher percentage of cardiogenin-treated MLC-GFP plasmid transfected MSCs expressed GFP after 7 days treatment compared to a very low percentage of GFP expression observed in the sham-treated cells. The latter is probably due to unspecific leakage of the plasmid construction. This plasmid also contains the neomycin-resistance gene to enable selection of permanently transfected clones. The MLC-GFP plasmid was transfected into MSCs by liposomal transfection. After 24 h when cells are &#x0223c;90&#x00025; confluent, a mixture containing 2.5 &#x000b5;g of plasmid DNA and 5 &#x000b5;l of Lipofectamine&#x02122; 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in OPTI-MEM<sup>R</sup>I (Invitrogen) were added to each 35 mm culture dish.

The chemical structure of the isolated cardiogenic-compound was determined by NMR and MS, and subsequently cross-referenced to databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004461-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). The therapeutic effect of the isolated compound, cardiogenin (chemically named Niga-ichigoside F1), was then compared with that of EGJ in the acute rat MI model to mimic acute MI in human patients. Although the area (4&#x02013;6 mm in diameter) distal to the ligation site appeared pure white and thin due to ischemic necrosis in sham-treated hearts 14 days post infarction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004461-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>), the corresponding areas in both EGJ&#x02212; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004461-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>) and cardiogenin-treated hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004461-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>) appeared red and the thickness of the ventricle and septal walls were well maintained.

Results showed MSC-specific markers including CD29, BST-1, SDF-1 and SDF-4, were detected in EGJ-treated tissues 3 days post infarction, indicating their MSC origin. We thus hypothesized that EGJ/cardiogenin could induce CD in MSCs at an efficient rate sufficient for myocardial regeneration. Hence the effect of EGJ/cardiogenin in inducing CD of MSCs <italic>in vitro</italic> was studied. MSCs cultured in medium containing EGJ (60 &#x000b5;g/ml) or cardiogenin (10 &#x000b5;g/ml) were stained positive for antibodies specific to two of the earliest cardiogenic lineage markers, MEF2 (&#x0003e;90&#x00025;) and GATA4 (&#x0003e;70&#x00025;), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004461-g004">Fig. 4a and b</xref>), signifying their early commitment to CD. Phase-contrast microscopy demonstrated that treated MSCs differentiated into elongated cells, some of which showed a recognizable striated appearance, differing from the irregularly shaped undifferentiated MSCs in the sham-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004461-g004">Fig. 4c and d</xref>). To further confirm CD of MSCs, MLC-GFP-transfected MSCs were treated with EGJ (60 &#x000b5;g/ml) or cardiogenin (10 &#x000b5;g/ml) for 3 and 6 days. It was found that &#x0003e;70&#x00025; and 50&#x00025; of the MSCs became rod-shaped with green fluorescence, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004461-g004">Fig. 4c and d</xref>), which can only be observed with the expression of cardiac-specific MLC. This phenotype verifies the differentiation of MSCs into cardiac progenitors. In sharp contrast, &#x0003c;6&#x00025; of the sham-treated cells displayed green fluorescence on day 6.

By contrast, much less DiI and MEF2 colocalized cells were observed in the hearts transplanted with sham-pretreated MSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004461-g004">Fig. 4e</xref>), possibly due to the low CDE in the sham-treated MSCs. Capillary density in the infarct area of hearts transplanted with cardiogenin-activated MSCs 7 days post transplantation was on average 13&#x000b1;3 per HPF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004461-g004">Fig. 4e</xref>), whereas only 5&#x000b1;2 vessels per HPF were in the infarct zone of hearts transplanted with sham-pretreated MSCs. The highly organized regenerating myocardium-like tissues in the hearts transplanted with cardiogenin-activated MSCs occupied on average 63&#x000b1;8.0&#x00025; of the total infarct volume 7 days post treatment as compared to &#x0003c;8&#x000b1;3.6&#x00025; in hearts receiving sham-treated MSCs. Collectively, these results suggest that the ability of EGJ/cardiogenin to repair infarcted heart could be due to their ability to increase CDE of endogenous MSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Signaling Pathways are Possibly Involved in Cardiogenin-mediated Myocardial Regeneration</title><p>Activation of signaling pathways using Oligo GEarray&#x000ae; Rat Transduction Pathway Finder&#x02122; Microarray was used to determine the possible signaling pathways involved in mediating the therapeutic effect of EGJ/cardiogenin on CD and MI repair.

In a previous publication, BMPs induced cardiac differentiation of P19CL6 <italic>in vitro</italic>, in which the cardiac differentiation was blocked by noggin, a specific inhibitor of BMPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Monzen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, to verify the involvement of BMP-4 in CD of MSCs and MI repair, noggin (R and D Systems) was used to suppress cardiogenin-induced CD of MSCs.

The regenerating cardiomyocytes observed in this study mainly originated from BM- derived MSCs. BM-derived haematopoietic stem cells may be excluded from being a possible contributor in myocardial regeneration, since a previous study of ours showed that haematopoietic stem cells could not be induced to undergo CD by EGJ/cardiogenin (unpublished data). The inability of haematopoietic stem cells to differentiate into myocardiocytes is consistent with other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Balsam1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Murry1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It should be noted that recent studies have reported cardiomyocytes derived from transplanted human embryonic stem cells (hES). Although the findings are of great interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Menasche1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Laflamme1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, the use of hES may be limited by the potential formation of teratomas containing derivatives of all three germ layers and immune rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Damjanov1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Nussbaum1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Our present results have provided an alternative way to promote significant myocardial regeneration by a plant extract or its active compound. The activation of endogenous MSCs for repair of infarcted heart will eliminate possible teratoma formation and immune rejection that may be associated with the use of hES. More importantly, the application of EGJ/cardiogenin is convenient and safe compared to other treatment strategies which usually involve cell transplantation or gene manipulation that may potentially bring about many severe complications. Therefore, EGJ/cardiogenin should be considered for immediate development as a new treatment remedy for MI.</p><p>The present findings suggest that EGJ/cardiogenin essentially activates four major signaling pathways to a level sufficient for myocardial regeneration and repair of infarcted hearts. These signaling pathways appear to act coherently in a time-dependent manner to bring about CD, since inhibition of one of the earliest upregulated molecules, BMP-4, is able to reduce MI repair <italic>in vivo</italic> or CD of MSCs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Interestingly, BMPs has also been shown to stimulate CD from hES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Pandur1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Together with the present findings, it implies that BMP-4 may be essential in CD regardless the cell types, hES or MSCs, from which cardiomyocytes are derived.</p><p>Evidence from this study also suggests possible involvement of other mechanisms elicited by EGJ/cardiogenin in repair of infarcted heart. The observed activation/upregulation of Akt1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Kennedy1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, Bcl2 and cell survival associated pathways, such as JAK-STAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Smithgall1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and NF&#x003ba;B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Karin1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Seo1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> pathways in both cardiogenin-activated MSCs and EGJ-treated MI hearts propose that EGJ/cardiogenin does have the ability to increase the survival potential of myocytes at risk along infarct rim and MSCs that migrate to the infarct zone. The observed numerous DiI-positive regenerating cardiomyocytes throughout the whole infarct zone of MI hearts transplanted with EGJ/cardiogenin-activated MSCs, as compared with a few scattered DiI-positive cells in sham MI hearts, could also be due to, at least partly, the increased survival potential of donor cells in the infarct zone.</p><p>In addition, many new vessels were observed in the whole infarct zone within 24 h in the treated, especially EGJ-treated, but not sham-treated MI hearts. Angiogenesis is required for the survival, trafficking and growth of cells necessary for the repair of infarcted heart, indicative of possible angiogenic action of cardiogenin as well as other possible angiogenic compound(s) contained in EGJ. The pathways of JAK-STAT and NF&#x003ba;B have been well documented to induce various angiogenic factors besides antiapoptotic proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Smithgall1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004461-Karin2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, activation of these pathways in cardiogenin-pretreated MSCs may also promote angiogenesis, and therefore, promote the reconstitution of damaged coronary vessels and further prevent cell death of transplanted MSCs for efficient MI repair.</p><p>The demonstrated therapeutic effect of EGJ and cardiogenin in our animal MI model and enhanced CDE of MSCs <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as the similar signaling pathways activated by EGJ and cardiogenin prove that cardiogenin is a major active compound responsible for significant repair of infarcted hearts. The identification of the chemical structure and therapeutic effect of cardiogenin, as well as an underlying mechanism involved, provide ground for immediate development of new treatment strategies for MI.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Professor Hsiao Chang Chan for her great endeavor in helping revision of the manuscript, Miss Sylvie Sau Wai Chung for her help in revision and
