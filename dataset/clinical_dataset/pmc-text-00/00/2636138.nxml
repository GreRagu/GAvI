His left eye had also started to turn inwards overthe past two years. As a result his vision was hindered thusinterfering with daily activities.</p><p>On examination, the best corrected visual acuity in theright eye was perception of light with accurate projection andin the left eye, counting fingers at 1.5 meters with accurateprojection. His glasses had a prescription of -6.5 dioptersphere with -1.50 diopter cylinder at 175 degrees in the righteye and -21.00 diopters in the left eye. Refraction was notpossible due to the dense cataract in both eyes. Axial lengthswere 32.70 mm in the left eye and 27.80 mm in the right eye.The right eye was severely esotropic with some hypotropia(which could not be measured as the eye could not take upfixation) and only the edge of the cornea could be visualized.The left eye showed esotropia of more than 90 prism diopters[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Ocular motility examination showed limitationof ocular movements in all directions of gaze, with minimalresidual adduction. There was mild bilateral aponeurotic ptosis.Anterior segment examination revealed dense nuclear cataractin both eyes. Fundus could not be visualized in the right eyedue to the severe esotropia and in the left eye, media washazy and the retina tessellated with a posterior staphyloma.Ultrasound B scan showed increased axial length and posteriorstaphyloma in both eyes. Imaging was not performed due tocost considerations.</p><p>During surgery, severe restriction of ocular movementswas noted in both eyes on forced duction testing, with onlyminimal adduction possible. Hooking of the medial rectuswas difficult. The medial rectus muscle was disinserted at itsinsertion in both eyes. However, there was a large residualesotropia and forced duction testing did not reveal anyremarkable improvement in the restriction after disinsertion.A conjunctival incision was made over the lateral rectusinsertion. The conjunctiva was retracted laterally using aretractor. 6-0 prolene suture was then passed through thesclera just anterior to the lateral rectus insertion and thenthrough the periosteum on the inner aspect of the lateralorbital wall, 2 mm inside the orbital rim. The suture wastugged to confirm passage through the periosteum and theconjunctiva was closed with 8-0 vicryl interrupted sutures[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The eyes were left in a position of 8-10 prismdiopters of abduction.</p><p>At six months of follow-up, there was residual esotropiaof 20 prism diopters in the right eye with 25 prism diopters ofhypotropia, however, the left eye was in the primary positionwith central fixation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. Ocular motility examinationrevealed limitation in all directions with minimal adduction.He had undergone cataract surgery in the left eye with a bestcorrected visual acuity of 20/60.</p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Discussion</title><p>Acquired strabismus fixus was described by Villaseca<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> andMartinez,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> who ascribed this to contracture of the medial rectusfollowing lateral rectus paralysis. Acquired strabismus fixushas also been reported to be associated with amyloidosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> andhigh myopia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p><p>Restrictive ocular motility problems have been known tooccur in high myopes. The currently accepted theory wasgiven by Yokoyama, who suggested that the enlarged globeherniates superotemporally through the muscle cone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Onmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the superior rectus is seento be nasally deviated and the lateral rectus muscle inferiorlydeviated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Krzizok <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> noted achange in the muscle path of the lateral rectus muscle on MRI. They noticed an inferiordisplacement of the lateral rectus muscle.</p><p>Several surgical procedures have been attempted to treatconvergent strabismus fixus in high myopes. Hayashi <italic>et al</italic>.,found medial rectus recession-lateral rectus resection to beeffective only in small deviations and performed transpositionof the superior rectus and inferior rectus along with medialrectus recession in cases with severe limitation of abduction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>Krzizok <italic>et al</italic>., fixed the lateral rectus muscle with a posteriorfixation suture in the physiological meridian to the sclera.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>In order to compensate for the inferolateral displacement ofthe lateral rectus muscle, Yokoyama <italic>et al</italic>., performed a loopmyopexy of the lateral and superior rectus muscles. Markedimprovement in eye movement was noted. This is probably thebest procedure as it addresses the problem of deviant musclepaths.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Wong <italic>et al</italic>. performed loop myopexy of the lateral andsuperior rectus muscle with a silicon 240 band and tighteningwith a sleeve with a satisfactory result.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Good outcome wasnoted with a partial Jensen&#x02032;s procedure to appose the adjacenthalves of the lateral and superior rectus muscles by Larsen <italic>etal</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Periosteal fixation of the sclera has been performed for thirdnerve palsy with satisfactory results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> In addition periosteal flapshave been used as globe tethers in severe paretic strabismus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p><p>Our patient had longstanding strabismus fixus with severeesotropia. The eyes were not aligned, even after medial rectusdisinsertion and considerable resistance was felt on forcedduction testing. Considering the resistance and the chanceof recurrence, we went ahead with scleral fixation of theeyeball to the periosteum near the lateral orbital rim. Markedfibrosis possibly occurs in longstanding cases and procedureslike transpositions or recession-resection may not be useful.This might also be the cause for the persistent restrictionto abduction after medial rectus disinsertion. The right eyewhich was more severely afflicted initially was noted to havea residual esotropia and hypotropia. However, the left eyecould be restored to the primary position. It is interestingthat the less myopic right eye was the severely esotropic eye;the exact cause for this is unclear, but it could be related tomore severe fibrosis associated with this eye. Imaging wouldhave been useful to delineate the paths of the muscles. Loopmyopexy addresses the basic problem, however, as the medialrectus was very tight on forced duction testing, our choice ofsurgical procedure was disinsertion and periosteal fixation. Toconclude, scleral fixation can be considered as a surgical optionin patients with gross restriction on forced duction testing insevere myopic strabismus fixus.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref
