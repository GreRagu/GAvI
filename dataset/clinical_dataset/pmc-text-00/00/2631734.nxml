Valid and reliable definitions and methods for surveillance are needed. Prevention and control efforts are largely based upon acute-care practices, many of which may be unnecessary, impractical, and expensive in a home setting. Infectious disease control principles should form the basis of training home- care providers to assess infection risk and develop prevention strategies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
