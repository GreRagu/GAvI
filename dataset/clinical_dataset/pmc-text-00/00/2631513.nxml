The host range and cell tropism of HIV-1 is highly restricted: it can only efficiently replicate in primary and immortalized T-cells and macrophages of human origin. Cells from rats and mice do not or only inefficiently support various steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Molecular characterization of some of these species-specific barriers has revealed the inability of several rodent orthologues of cellular factors, essential for HIV replication in human cells, to support distinct viral functions. The entry of HIV-1 provides a compelling example: the CD4 binding receptor and the chemokine co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 from rodents generally cannot support viral entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Expression of the human HIV-1 receptor complex largely overcomes the entry restriction, and this observation has spured efforts to develop transgenic (-tg) mouse and rat models permissive for HIV replication through a block-by-block humanization (for an overview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). This conceptual approach seeks to surmount intrinsic limitations in the HIV-1 replication cycle in small animals by stable introduction of critical human transgenes into the genome of laboratory rodents using transgene or knock-in technology.</p><p>Consequently, we generated Sprague-Dawley rats that transgenically express hCD4 and hCCR5 selectively on CD4 T-cells, macrophages, and microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the major targets for productive HIV-1 infection in humans. After a systemic challenge with HIV-1<sub>YU-2</sub>, these double-tg animals harboured significant levels of HIV-1 cDNAs in lymphatic organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], up to 10<sup>6 </sup>HIV-1 cDNA copies per 10<sup>6 </sup>splenocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], demonstrating a robust susceptibility to HIV-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. This level of susceptibility was several orders of magnitude higher than in comparable tg mouse or rabbit models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and allowed a preclinical proof-of-principle efficacy study for a peptidic HIV entry inhibitor and a reverse transcriptase inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Despite this advancement, significant limitations exist in the current model: levels of plasma viremia are low and only transient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. To a large extent, these limitations may be due to a cell type-specific block to productive HIV-1 infection in hCD4/hCCR5-tg rats. Primary T-cells, in contrast to macrophages from these animals, did not support a productive R5 HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Following up on this observation, we recently compared the efficiency of early steps of the HIV replication cycle in infected primary T-cells from hCD4/hCCR5-tg rats and human donors. Remarkably, levels of viral entry, HIV-1 cDNA production, nuclear import of the preintegration complex, as well as the frequency of integration into the host genome, were similar in both species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In contrast, a profound post-entry impairment was evident for early HIV gene expression in primary rat T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We reasoned that a transcriptional deficit due to an inefficient Tat-dependent HIV-1 LTR transactivation may underlie this inefficient viral gene expression in rats as it does in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Cyclin T1 (CycT1) is a key component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], which is critical for efficient elongation of many cellular as well as HIV transcripts (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). In mice, the inability of CycT1 to support the interaction with the transactivation response (TAR) element when bound to Tat has been mapped to one critical amino acid (tyrosine-261; cytosine-261 in hCycT1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Intriguingly, rat and mouse CycT1 have a 96% sequence homology and both contain tyrosine-261 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. While ectopic expression of hCycT1 in NIH3T3 cells resulted in a marked, ~10- to 100-fold enhancement of LTR-driven gene expression, this effect was quite moderate, only ~3-fold in Rat2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], challenging the potential benefit of ectopic expression of hCycT1 in the rat species. However, evidence in support of such an approach was provided by an experiment, in which transient coexpression of hCycT1 and proviral HIV reporter DNA in nucleofected primary rat T-cells resulted in a marked enhancement of early viral gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This suggested that an underlying transcriptional defect linked to the non-functional rat orthologue was, at least in part, responsible for the gene expression phenotype in native rat T-cells.</p><p>In NIH3T3 or Rat2 cells, additional less-defined blocks in the late phase of the HIV-1 replication cycle add up to a profound drop in the yield of viral progeny, up to 10<sup>4</sup>-fold or 10<sup>2</sup>-fold, respectively, from a single round of replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In both the mouse and rat fibroblast cell line, these late-stage barriers display a recessive phenotype and likely result from non-functional rodent cofactors since they can be surmounted in rodent-human heterokaryons. In striking contrast to all mouse cell line studies, mice that carry a full-length HIV-1 provirus have been reported to secrete high levels of infectious HIV-1 with viremia levels of &#x0003e;60,000 HIV RNA copies per ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Moreover, in T-cells and macrophages from these provirus-carrying mice, tg co-expression of hCycT1 markedly boosted HIV-1 transcription and virus production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>On a more general level, the transcriptional phenotype as well as the severe late-phase limitations described in rodent cell lines may thus not necessarily be predictive for the ability of primary cells to support these steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle. In the current study, we generated rats that transgenically express hCycT1 in a cell type-specific manner to explore their suitability for enhancing HIV-1 transcription and gene expression in primary T-cells and macrophages. Moreover, we wanted to probe whether ameliorating the transcriptional deficit by hCycT1 transgenesis may render primary T-cells from rats that transgenically co-express the HIV receptor complex susceptible for a productive and spreading R5 HIV-1 infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Construction of tg rats that selectively express hCycT1 in HIV target cells</title><p>To selectively express hCycT1 in the most relevant HIV-1 target cells, we employed a chimeric mouse/human transgene vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) that directs expression of cDNA inserts exclusively in CD4 T-cells and cells from the monocyte/macrophage lineage. This strategy has been employed to generate hCCR5-tg rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] as well as hCXCR4-tg rats (O.T.K. and M.A.G., unpublished). Several independent rat lines tg for hCycT1 were developed by pronuclear microinjection of fertilized oocytes from outbred Sprague-Dawley rats. Five hCycT1 integration founders were identified by a transgene-specific PCR, which amplifies a ~1.7-kb fragment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), and four of these founders transmitted the transgene to their progeny (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of hCycT1 in CD4 T-cells and macrophages from hCycT1-tg rats</bold>.

F2 progeny did not reveal any gross histopathology (data not shown), and offspring from this hCycT1-tg line have generally been healthy. The expression pattern of hCycT1 was examined in select tissues and purified cell populations from hCycT1-tg rats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x02013;E</xref>). First, hCycT1 expression was readily detectable in rCD4 T-cell-rich thymocyte extracts from hCycT1-tg rats, but not from a non-tg (n-tg) littermate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Second, the T-cell subset-specific expression of hCycT1 was analyzed in rCD4- and rCD8-positive splenocytes separated by antibody-coupled magnetic beads (purities of 94% and 93%, respectively; data not shown). A low, but significant hCycT1 expression was detectable only in the rCD4-positive, but not in the rCD8-positive, purified splenocyte fractions of both hCycT1-tg animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, * hCycT1). Third, hCycT1 expression was found in spleen-derived macrophages from the two hCycT1-tg rats tested as well as monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from a human donor, but not in macrophages from a n-tg control rat (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Thus, expression of hCycT1 has been targeted to the desired, biologically relevant cell types in tg rats. This finding is consistent with the exclusive expression of hCCR5 or hCD4 on these rat cells, employing the identical or a closely related transgene vector backbone, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and with the targeted expression of hCycT1 in tg mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, it provides the conceptual basis to generate potentially more susceptible rats through interbreeding of these different tg rat lines to achieve expression of all of these human transgenes in the same HIV target cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary T-cells from hCycT1-tg rats support markedly elevated levels of early HIV gene expression</title><p>As a first functional characterization, activated T-cells from hCycT1-tg rats and n-tg littermates were transfected with proviral GFP reporter plasmids, pHIV-1<sub>NL4-3 </sub>GFP or pHIV-2<sub>ROD-A </sub>GFP, with a species-adapted nucleofection protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and analyzed for GFP expression in viable cells one day later (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

Activated T-cells from 3 n-tg and 3 hCycT1-tg rats were nucleofected with either pHIV-1<sub>NL4-3 </sub>LTR GFP or pHIV-2<sub>ROD-A </sub>LTR GFP in the presence or absence of expression plasmids encoding for HIV-1 Tat and HIV-2 Tat, respectively, and analyzed by flow cytometry one day later. The basal, Tat-independent LTR activity was comparable for both groups of animals irrespective of the hCycT1 transgene status (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>; open histograms). Importantly, co-expression of Tat elevated levels of early gene expression in T-cells from the group of n-tg rats by 4-fold (HIV-1) and 3-fold (HIV-2) and, notably, 6-fold (HIV-1) and 5-fold (HIV-2) in hCycT1-tg T-cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>; filled histograms). Furthermore, parallel nucleofection studies of T-cell cultures from the identical animals with the corresponding full-length proviral constructs showed a ~2-fold enhancement in this limited set of animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C, D</xref>). Moreover, this phenotype was largely recapitulated in single-round infection experiments with VSV-G pseudotyped stocks of these HIV strains, assessing GFP expression on day 3 after infection (2-fold for HIV-1 and 4-fold for HIV-2; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E, F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>hCycT1 transgenensis enhances the Tat-responsiveness of rat T-cells</bold>.

Antibody-coupled magnetic bead enrichment of CD4 T-cells, unfortunately, interferes with their viability, proliferative capacity, and subsequent HIV susceptibility (data not shown), and could thus not be used for functional analyses of T-cells from transgenic animals. We thus investigated in more detail the consequences of VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 GFP infection of these splenocyte-derived T-cell bulk cultures. First, the relative percentage of CD4 T-cells was independent of the transgene status and quite variable ranging from 6 to 72% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B, C</xref>, and data not shown). Importantly, the hCycT1-mediated enhancement of early HIV-1 gene expression seen in the analysis of infected T-cell bulk cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), closely matched the enhancement of gene expression in the subset of CD4 T-cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>) on the level of individual animals. Of note, also a slight enhancing effect was observed in the CD4-negative population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>), possibly reflecting a leakage of transgene expression into the CD8 T-cells subset, despite exclusive detection of hCycT1 in CD4 T-cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Overall, the degree of hCycT1-mediated enhancement of early gene expression was slightly less pronounced in the bulk cultures compared to the CD4 T-cells (compare Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Thus, the analysis of HIV gene expression in VSV-G HIV-1 pseudotype-infected bulk cultures of activated rat splenocytes in the context of hCycT1 transgenesis reflects to a large degree the situation in the CD4 T-cell subset.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Functional analysis of hCycT1 transgenesis in T-cell bulk cultures from rats mirrors the subset-specific impact in CD4 T-cells</bold>.

The percentage of infected, GFP-positive cells ranged from 0.2-2% (data not shown). Of note, absolute levels and hCycT1-dependent enhancement of early HIV-1 gene expression were nearly identical in rat splenocyte cultures activated by either IL-2 alone or IL-7 alone compared to the cultures activated by the standard protocol using ConA/IL-2 (data not shown). With infected T-cells from human donors providing a critical reference, hCycT1 transgenesis markedly narrowed the rat-human species gap for early HIV-1<sub>NL4-3 </sub>gene expression from a difference of 4.5-fold for n-tg rats down to 1.6-fold for hCycT1-tg rats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, left panel).

Remarkably, infected T-cells from ~1/4 of hCycT1-tg rats supported early HIV-1<sub>NL4-3 </sub>gene expression at levels within the average range of infected human T-cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, left panel).

In activated, infected T-cells, we therefore explored the relationship between the expression levels of hCycT1 and the ability to support early viral gene expression. Three days after infection with VSV-G HIV-1<sub>NL4-3 </sub>GFP, cultures derived from 10 heterozygous hCycT1-tg rats supported early HIV-1 gene expression at quite variable levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, filled bars).

Cultures derived from the four n-tg animals supported only low levels of viral gene expression levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, open bars; MFI&#x0003c;320), and the results for which were statistically indistinguishable from the low-responder group among the hCycT1-tg animals. At the time of infection, a cell aliquot was harvested to determine levels of hCycT1 expression in lysates by species-specific western blot analysis. The steady-state expression level of hCycT1 differed markedly between cultures from individual rats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>); however, no correlation with the phenotype of infected cultures for early HIV gene expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) could be established.

Importantly, cultures from ~1/4 of hCycT1-tg rats reached levels of HIV gene expression within the average range of infected human T-cells. However, while hCycT1 expression was clearly required, no correlation could be established between steady-state expression levels of hCycT1 and the ability of infected cultures to support early HIV gene expression. This finding is consistent with a scenario in which endogenous factors in concert with hCycT1 play a decisive role in regulating HIV LTR-driven gene expression in rat T-cells. Alternatively, only a subset of CD4 T-cells may be capable of translating hCycT1 expression into an enhanced gene expression and in these cells transgene expression levels may still correlate with the functional impact.</p><p>In principle, this could involve the recruitment of transcription factors (e.g., NF-&#x003ba;B, SP1, NFAT) to the 5'-LTR as well as factors regulating the activity of P-TEFb. Interestingly, no cellular gene is as sensitive to the availability of P-TEFb as the genes of HIV-1 (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). So far, several positive regulators of P-TEFb and HIV-1 LTR transactivation have been reported, including bromodomain protein Brd4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and the DNA-dependent ATPase subunit Brm of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

Furthermore, transcription factor recruitment at contiguous LTR regions is partly dependent on histone acetylation as well as the viral Tat protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Conceivably, the interaction of such endogenous factors with the Tat/hCycT1-containing P-TEFb complex may be different in rats than in humans. Similarly, dominant-negative activities of CycT1 or CycT2 of rat origin have to be considered in a hCycT1-tg context.</p><p>Recently, Sun <italic>et al. </italic>reported that hCycT1 transgenesis in mice, employing the identical transgene vector, also resulted in a cell type-specific expression in CD4 T-cells, macrophages as well as microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

HIV-1 p24 concentrations in supernatants were still lower than the levels typically reached in dynamically infected human cultures. In a more refined characterization of T-cells from these hCycT1-tg mice, Zhang <italic>et al. </italic>demonstrated HIV-1 RNA expression per infected T-cell was only 10% of that of human references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], indicating that the transcriptional deficit also in this rodent had only partially been overcome by hCycT1 transgenesis. Of note, this analysis required a secondary T-cell receptor stimulation to circumvent a peri-integrational block in primary mouse T-cells, which is absent in the rat species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Interestingly, infected rat macrophages pose an exception to the otherwise species-specific impairment at the level of early HIV-1 gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As shown herein, tg expression of hCycT1 does not translate into an enhanced viral gene expression in this primary cell type, and already macrophages from n-tg rats are at a level comparable to human MDM. This may, in part, relate to the ability of HIV-1 to exploit a distinct set of nuclear transcription factors and alternative mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in macrophages compared to other cell types, including T-cells (for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]). In addition, hCycT1-dependence and species-specific differences of HIV LTR driven gene expression appear to be less pronounced or even absent when levels of gene expression per cell are low. This was observed both for macrophages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) and T-cells infected with the HIV-1 strain R7/3 with apparently lower intrinsic LTR activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>, compare left and right panel). Notably, macrophages from hCD4/hCCR5-tg rats are the only primary non-human cells reported to allow a productive HIV-1 infection, albeit at lower levels than in human MDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The general ability of macrophages to support HIV LTR-driven transcription and, related to that, their responsiveness to transgenic hCycT1 expression, appears to be remarkably different in rats and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Zhang <italic>et al. </italic>also characterized the late phase in primary T-cells from hCycT1-tg mice <italic>ex vivo </italic>and report post-transcriptional defects at the levels of Gag expression, Gag processing, Gag release and virus infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. They estimated that the post-integration defects alone add up to a 300- to 500-fold reduction in the yield of infectious virus after a single cycle of HIV-1 replication. It is currently unclear why T-cells from provirus-tg mice appear to be much less restricted in supporting these steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Limitations for several distinct late-phase steps in rodent cells have been proposed, including the Rev-dependent export of HIV-1 RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] Gag trafficking and virion assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], both inhibitory and supportive functions of TRIM family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], as well as the Vif-resistance of mouse APOBEC3G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. These findings are of high relevance for future analyses of the late-phase defect in T-cells from rats and possible additional genetic modifications of the host.</p><p>We identify HIV-1<sub>R7/3 </sub>YU-2 Env GFP as a virus, the behavior of which in tg rat T-cells <italic>ex vivo </italic>displays key characteristics of a spreading, primarily cell-to-cell-mediated infection: first, GFP expression from the <italic>nef </italic>locus, a surrogate for early viral gene expression in infected cells, increased continuously over periods of 2 weeks with peak levels comparable to human reference cultures. This was not a general property of replication-competent HIV-1 GFP reporter viruses since another R5 strain failed to recapitulate this phenotype. Second, this increase was sensitive to efavirenz addition 18 h p.i. and also not seen for an <italic>env</italic>-deficient single-round virus. This demonstrates the requirement for multiple rounds of replication involving reverse transcription. Third, the lack of significant p24 levels in supernatants from infected rat T-cell cultures and the successful transfer of infection to na&#x000ef;ve cultures only through cells, but not supernatant from infected cultures, indicates a primarily cell-to-cell-mediated spread. Levels of p24 antigen per infected rat T-cell as well as the overall percentage of infected T-cells in culture may have been too low to detect a spread by quantification of cell-associated p24 levels. This challenging observation warrants further investigations. It will be interesting to investigate the genetic determinants in HIV-1<sub>R7/3 </sub>YU-2 Env GFP that underlie its ability to propagate in tg rat T-cells. Through such a genetic approach and forced adaptation of this or other HIV-1 strains for replication in the improved transcriptional context of triple-tg rat T-cells, the evolution of a highly rat-adapted HIV-1 strain may be feasible. Moreover, the molecular characterization of such an adapted strain could greatly facilitate the identification of host determinants that are critical regulators of late phase-steps of HIV replication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>The hCD4/hCCR5-tg rats have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].
