Approximately 10&#x02013;25% of colon cancer patients present one or multiple liver metastases at the time of diagnose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. At least in 30% of these cases the liver is the only organ affected, apart from the tumor in the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, recurrence after surgical removal of the primary lesion occurs mainly in the liver, with a 20&#x02013;25% rate of metachronous liver metastases. Potentially curative resection of hepatic tumors is not feasible in more than 75% of the cases due to large size, elevated number and/or unfavourable localization of lesions, or poor liver function. Nonsurgical approaches including systemic chemotherapy and regional treatments are the only options for these patients. Local control is often achieved and these techniques are rapidly improving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], but a significant increase in long-term survival is not guaranteed. Therefore, hepatic metastases from colon cancer are frequently observed in the clinic and they are the most frequent cause of death in these patients. Advances in the management of this disease will probably require the combination of standard care and new therapies that are still in the experimental stage.</p><p>Immunotherapy is one of these alternatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Systemic or local administration of vectors driving expression of immunostimulatory cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) has demonstrated potent antitumor effects in pre-clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, further optimization of this approach is required, and improvement in animal models is needed so that research in this area can generate more clinically relevant results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we described a High-Capacity (<italic>gutless</italic>) adenoviral vector carrying a liver-specific inducible system for the expression of murine IL-12 (GL-Ad/RUmIL-12). Intravenous administration of this vector eliminated intrahepatic colon cancer in a murine model when intense production of IL-12 was induced at early stages of the disease. If more restrictive conditions are used (larger tumors and lower dose of vector that leads to moderate IL-12 concentration) the antitumor response was heterogeneous (manuscript in preparation), as observed with many other experimental approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In these cases, a more detailed characterization of the partial responses would be desirable, and longitudinal monitoring of individual subjects could identify transient antitumor effects. Implantation of certain colon cancer cell lines in the liver of syngeneic mice constitutes one kind of intrahepatic cancer model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although each model has its own limitations, progressive growth and extra hepatic dissemination of these tumors often leads to the death of the animal, recapitulating some aspects of the natural history found in humans. However, monitoring progression in these internal tumors by direct measurement requires repeated laparotomy or large groups of animals to be sacrificed at different time points, thus precluding an individualized follow-up. Different noninvasive imaging techniques have been developed to overcome these limitations. Some of them such as ultrasonography (US) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], computerized tomography (CT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], positron emission tomography (PET) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] are adaptations of clinical imaging devices to the use in small animals. Others such as fluorescence imaging (FLI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and bioluminescent imaging (BLI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] have been specifically developed for the <italic>in vivo </italic>monitoring of gene expression in experimental animals, mostly rodents.</p><p>Bioluminescence of cells is based on a chemical reaction catalyzed by the luciferase enzyme in which a substrate (D-luciferin) is converted into an excited oxyluciferin intermediate in the presence of Oxygen, Magnesium and ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. When oxyluciferin returns to its relaxed state, it emits a photon in the visible wavelength range. The most common source for luciferase is the firefly <italic>Photinus pyralis</italic>. Since no luciferase expression is found in mammalian cells and there is no need for external light excitation, this method of cell labelling has a very low background. The intensity of light is proportional to the amount of luciferase expressed in each individual cell, and the number of cells in which the gene has been transferred. In addition, actual light detectors have a very high dynamic range. Therefore, luciferase-based assays have been widely used to study changes in gene expression intensity <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. For tumor imaging, a luciferase expressing gene is transferred to cancer cells and stable clones are implanted into permissive hosts. These can be syngeneic animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], but in the case of human cancer cell lines, immunodeficient mice or rats are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. A cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera attached to a light-tight chamber is then used to detect the intensity and location of light emission. The high sensitivity of BLI has been extensively demonstrated in different tumor models, including colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, stability of luciferase expression and maintenance of a good correlation between light emission and tumor burden needs further investigation, especially if orthotopic (intrahepatic) immunocompetent models are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The influence of anatomical barriers and the fact that luciferase is a foreign gene could interfere with this correlation. Therefore, in this study we have stably transfected MC38 murine colon cancer cells with a plasmid carrying luciferase gene and have monitored the evolution of bioluminescence and tumor volume after subcutaneous or intrahepatic inoculation of cells in C57BL/6 mice. We found a direct correlation between these two parameters in both cases, although higher dispersion was observed at late stages of the experiment. Long-term maintenance of the genetically modified cells and stability of luciferase expression were observed.</p><p>In addition, we provide evidence showing that this model is suitable for evaluation of individual responses to immunotherapy. Using BLI monitoring, we were able to identify subsets of animals that experienced transient reduction in tumor progression, and to clearly distinguish this group from others having no effect, or long-term complete responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Characterization of MC38 colon cancer cells stably transfected with the luciferase gene</title><p>MC38 cells were transfected with a plasmid carrying luciferase under the control of the CMV promoter, and 10 different clones were isolated after antibiotic selection. As expected, clones varied in their specific luciferase activity (measured by standard luminometer -data not shown-). In figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> we represent light emission in living cells corresponding to 3 clones after incubation of increasing number of cells with the substrate D-luciferin. Clone number 1 (MC38Luc1) was chosen for further characterization because it presented the highest luciferase activity. We determined that at least 500 MC38Luc1 cells are required to obtain a luminescence significantly higher than background (3,590 +/- 1,275 versus 1,900 +/- 1,300 photons/s, respectively). Intense light emission was maintained for at least 40 passages <italic>in vitro</italic>, as shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. A transient increase in the specific luciferase activity (photons/s/cell) was observed until passage 30, with further stabilization (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This rules out the possibility that the CMV promoter is inhibited over time in the MC38Luc1 clone. Luciferase expression was analyzed by immunocytochemistry (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) in order to verify that the transgene is expressed in all individual cells at late passages. The lack of negative cells supports the absence of promoter silencing.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of the MC38Luc1 cell line</bold>. A.-Three independent MC38Luc clones were seeded in 96-well plates at different cell densities, and incubated with the luciferase substrate D-luciferin. Light emission from living cells in each well was immediately quantified using a CCD camera. The horizontal discontinuous line indicates the background light emission of an empty well. B. &#x02013; The same procedure was used to quantify light emission from clone 1 (MC38Luc1) after maintenance in vitro for at least 40 passages.

We could not detect any difference in tumor progression between both groups. In figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, we represent the average tumor volume 3 weeks after inoculation of cells, determined by direct calliper measurement. Therefore, integration of the luciferase expression cassette in the genome of the MC38Luc1 clone did not change their ability to form tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>. In a previous report by an independent group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], MC38 cells transduced with retroviruses encoding luciferase or GFP showed moderate differences in tumor progression, although both cell lines gave rise to tumors that grew progressively for at least 20 days. The size of tumors observed in our experiments (367 mm<sup>3 </sup>after 21 days) coincides remarkably with the clone described by Choy et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This and other studies in syngeneic animals clearly demonstrate that tumor cells expressing luciferase are not selectively eliminated by the immune system.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of US and BLI for noninvasive monitorization of liver metastases</title><p>We inoculated 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>MC38Luc1 cells in the liver of C57BL/6 mice and monitored tumor progression by BLI or US. Subsets of animals in the group were laparotomized or sacrificed at one week intervals for direct calliper measurement of tumor diameters. In figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, we show representative examples of colorectal metastases identified by the three methods at different stages of the disease. Both BLI and US were able to detect the presence and localization of lesions, and to assess their progression over time. US was less sensitive and could not detect the small tumors rising one week after cell injection. However, this technique provided more anatomical information about tumor spread and involvement of other organs. As expected, BLI had lower spatial resolution, but it was able to indicate the approximate location and size of tumors in most of the cases, apart from the light emission quantification. In fact, in those few animals that survived more than 5 weeks, lung metastases usually occurred and could be detected by BLI (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Finally, BLI is faster (at least 10 mice can be analyzed at a time in less than 20 minutes) and requires less technical training than US. In order to validate the noninvasive imaging of liver metastases, we analyzed the correlation between BLI, US and direct tumor measurement. In figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> we show the progression of the average tumor volume determined by laparotomy or US, as well as the luciferase activity (light emission in photons/s). From this comparison, we can see that tumor progression can be monitored using both BLI and US. In agreement with previous results from other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], BLI is the most sensitive technique, because tumor cells can be detected as early as 2 days after implantation, before they form macroscopic tumors. The maximum background light emission detected in a non-tumor bearing animal was 10,000 photons/s, approximately 10 times less than the average emission of MC38Luc1-injected animals. US started to detect hepatic lesion 2 weeks later. In our experience, tumor diameters determined by US are smaller than those obtained by direct calliper measurement and therefore the estimated volume of tumors is reduced. We believe this is due to the restrictive criteria used to define tumor margins in the US and does not affect the validity of the technique. In fact, correlation between tumor volumes calculated by both methods is good (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Monitorization of hepatic tumors by BLI and US</bold>.

In figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, we represent the values for individual animals at day 13 after cell implantation. Later on, when tumors became large enough to be detected by physical examination, linear correlation was partially lost (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). In general, this is due to a plateau in the luciferase activity of tumors (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), which does not cope with tumor growth in the later stages of the disease. To investigate if this is specific for intrahepatic tumors, we inoculated MC38Luc1 cells subcutaneously and analyzed the same parameters. In figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> we show the average tumor volume and light emission over time. As expected in superficial tumors, high bioluminescence was observed at early time points, and there was a progressive increase following tumor growth. In terms of bioluminescence/volume correlation, it was optimal during the first 3 weeks (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), and then the values started to be more dispersed (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Therefore, the same trend is observed in subcutaneous and hepatic tumors, although the partial loss of correlation is more obvious in the hepatic lesions, probably because they grow faster. This suggests that BLI is less reliable to assess tumor burden in advanced stages of the disease, when tumors approach their maximum size. Nevertheless, it can be useful to determine non-invasively a criteria for animal sacrifice before they reach the undesirable situation of extremely large lesions, thus contributing to the refinement of intrahepatic tumor models. In this case, it seems that light emission higher than 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>photons/s could be considered a reasonable limit.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Correlation between BLI, US and direct tumor volume determination in hepatic tumors</bold>.

The observation periods described in the literature are heterogeneous, and the time to reach the "advanced stage" differs in each tumor model. Nevertheless, attenuation of luciferase signal has been previously described in another colorectal cancer liver metastasis model developed in Balb/c mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A partial loss of correlation between BLI and physical measurement was found in large tumors starting on day 20 after cell inoculation, which is similar to our observations. In this case the main reason was the quenching effect of the ascitic fluid, which is usually abundant in advanced CT26 tumors growing in the liver. Accumulation of large volumes of hemorrhagic ascites was less frequent in our intrahepatic MC38Luc1 tumors. In addition, this factor cannot play a role in the subcutaneous tumors described here. In a different study, a marked inhibition of bioluminescence was found in a bladder cancer model, starting 2 weeks after cell implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The authors demonstrated a reduction in light emission from necrotic and hemorrhagic areas of the tumors. In addition, these areas can contribute to the quenching effect of surrounding tissues. If the proportion of these inactive fractions of the tumor increases over time and is more prevalent in large tumors, this is a feasible explanation for the loss of correlation between bioluminescence and tumor volume. In our model, histological analysis of tumors revealed variable regions of necrosis and haemorrhage. However, when we studied individual tumors, we could not establish a direct correlation between the abundance of these areas and the decline of light emission (data not shown). Therefore, other factors may play a role in this phenomenon. We have verified by quantitative PCR that there is no decrease in the frequency of luciferase plasmids integrated in the tumors at different time points. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, we found an average of approximately 4 copies of plasmid for every copy of the endogenous albumin gene (which means 2 copies per genome) even in the very advanced stage (day 28). This indicates that the MC38Luc1 cells do not lose the luciferase gene over time <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the proportion of these cells in the tumor mass is maintained on average. Interestingly, the ratio of copies/genome is not randomly distributed among tumors at day 28 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). We observed that larger tumors tend to present less copies of luciferase plasmid per genome, suggesting that stromal cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, etc.), which do not contribute to the luciferase expression are more abundant in these tumors. These luciferase-inactive components of the tumors, together with areas of necrosis and haemorrhage are mixed in variable proportions and impair an accurate determination of tumor volume by BLI. Therefore, in advanced stages of our tumor model, the functional information obtained by BLI prevails over the morphological criteria.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of luciferase stability and function <italic>in vivo</italic></bold>.

Differences in the extension and intensity of hypoxic areas could contribute to the lack of correlation between light emission and tumor volume. To investigate this possibility, we obtained lysates from advanced tumors and performed <italic>in vitro </italic>luciferase reactions. Under these circumstances, luciferase activity (measured in Relative Luciferase Units, RLUs in a standard luminometer) only depends on the amount of functional enzyme, because all other components of the reaction, including ATP, are contained in the assay buffer. Therefore, if lack of ATP is limiting light emission in some of the MC38Luc1 tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>, luciferase activity should be restored <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, we did not observe any sample in which low photon emission <italic>in vivo </italic>was accompanied by an unexpectedly high RLU value <italic>in vitro </italic>(figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). This suggests that hypoxia is not interfering with BLI in the MC38Luc1 model. However, the correlation between both parameters was modest (r<sup>2 </sup>= 0.42) due to considerable dispersion of values. Therefore, we cannot definitely rule out the possibility that availability of ATP <italic>in vivo </italic>is affecting the accuracy of BLI.</p></sec><sec><title>Validity of BLI to monitor the efficacy of immunotherapy</title><p>The ability of BLI to evaluate the efficacy of conventional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] or experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] treatments has been demonstrated in different tumor models, but little is known about immunotherapy approaches in syngeneic mice. We have previously described a potent antitumor effect of the high-capacity adenoviral vector GL-Ad/RUmIL-12 on intrahepatic MC38-derived tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A liver-specific, Mifepristone-inducible expression system allows controlled expression of IL-12. The vector was administered one week before cell implantation, and activation of IL-12 expression started 5 days later. Under these circumstances, tumor eradication was observed in most of the animals when high doses of IL-12 were achieved. Now we aim to evaluate the efficacy of GL-Ad/RUmIL-12 in a more restrictive setting. BLI was used with the objective of determining the onset and duration of the antitumor response in each animal. In the actual protocol, tumor cells (MC38Luc1) were implanted before administration of the virus. Initial BLI performed 48 hours after cell inoculation allowed us to verify the localization of cells in the liver area and the homogeneity of experimental groups in terms of light emission (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The next day, a moderate dose of GL-Ad/RUmIL-12 vector (2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>iu) was administered intravenously, and induction of IL-12 expression started one week later. Therefore, tumors had progressed for 10 days before the treatment effectively started. The induction regime consisted on 10 daily injections of 250 &#x003bc;g/kg Mifepristone intraperitoneally, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The average concentration of IL-12 in serum was 27 ng/ml after the first mifepristone administration, which is consistent with the dose of virus used. Bioluminescence quantification detected significant differences between the control and treated groups as early as 7 days after initiation of IL-12 expression (day 17 after cell inoculation, figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). More importantly, subsequent BLI monitorization (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) allowed us to distinguish 3 subsets of animals inside the treatment group: non-responders (NR), in which light emission was similar to the control group; mice showing a partial response (PR) consisting in a transient inhibition of luciferase activity; and finally others in which the signal was completely and permanently abolished (CR). All animals that survived long enough were laparotomized 4 weeks after initiation of the experiment in order to determine the size of liver tumors by direct calliper measurement. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, stratification of mice according to bioluminescence was in accordance with the changes observed in tumor volume. In the PR group, a significant reduction was observed during the 4<sup>th </sup>week of the experiment, but the tumors progressed and all animals finally died during the next 4 weeks because of their hepatic lesions. In contrast, mice in the CR group remained tumor-free and were negative for luciferase activity for the entire duration of the experiment (more than 6 months).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Antitumor effect of IL-12 monitored by BLI</bold>.

Twenty-four hours later, cells were washed in PBS and D-luciferin substrate (Promega) was added at a final concentration of 150 &#x003bc;g/ml. Light emission from culture plates was detected immediately using the IVIS CCD camera system (Xenogen) and analyzed with the Living Image 2.20 software package (Xenogen). For <italic>in vivo </italic>imaging and quantification of light emission, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of Xylacine and Ketamine and 150 mg/kg D-luciferin (100 &#x003bc;l of a 30.3 mg/ml solution dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline) were injected intraperitoneally. Ten minutes later, animals were placed in the dark chamber for light acquisition. Typically, a circular region of interest measuring 3 cm in diameter was defined in the abdomen of mice, and quantification of light emission was performed in photons/second. Time exposure ranged from 1 second to 5 minutes depending on light intensity. A maximum of 10 animals were analyzed at a time.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of luciferase activity in solution</title><p>Fifty to 150 mg of frozen tumor samples were lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) and centrifuged at 13.000 rpm in a cooled microfuge for 10 minutes.
