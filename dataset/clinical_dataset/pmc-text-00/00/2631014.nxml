Patients rate each of these aspects on five-point Likert scales ranging from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Lipner[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] applied generalizability theory to the survey as administered to patients about their physicians. The variance component for participants was 0.01.

We conducted factor analysis to search for items showing a high level of commonality. Prior to conducting the factor analysis, we tested the suitability of the scale using the Kaiser-Meyer-Oklin (KMO) test and the Bartlett's Test of Sphericity. Because the data were skewed toward the higher values, we re-categorized the answer choices into three groups: "poor or fair," "good," and "very good or excellent."</p><p>We then conducted a series of analyses to evaluate the psychometric properties of the survey questionnaire. We measured internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) to assess whether all the items were contributing to the measurement of professionalism. We also measured inter-item gamma scores to examine the level of relationship between the items in the questionnaire. Gamma replaced the standard Pearson <italic>r </italic>correlation due to the categorical nature of the results. We assessed association utilizing cross tabulation techniques with chi square statistics to determine the discriminative validity of the proposed instrument, regardless of the demographic and educational characteristics of the participants. In addition, we calculated the Kruskal-Wallis K Independent Samples test to examine differences in total score across demographic and educational groups. The total score was computed by tabulating the sum of all 11 items to provide a continuous measure of communications skills and professionalism. We used SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois) for all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 149 individuals who registered for the session, 132 participated in the survey but only 130 completed the entire questionnaire (87.2% response rate).

Component 1 (Interpersonal Relations) showed an internal consistency reliability of 0.82 and component two (Communication and Professionalism) showed an internal consistency reliability of 0.80. Based on these results, both components show a high level of internal consistency reliability, suggesting that each component's items are measuring the main idea of the components.</p><p>The Kruskal-Wallis K Independent Samples test resulted in no significant differences between groups in each of the demographic and educational variables.

On the other hand, U.S. graduates, compared with international graduates, rated themselves significantly more positively on Item 10 (using words they can understand, etc.; <italic>p </italic>= 0.003).</p><p>Finally, residents in surgical specialties, compared with non-surgical specialties, rated themselves significantly more positively on Item 7 (discussing options with patients, etc.; <italic>p </italic>= 0.005).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The main utility of our educational exercise (the professionalism presentation) was to raise resident awareness regarding issues of doctor-patient communication and to expose them to a tool which has been used to survey patients about their perceptions of their doctors. Our psychometric analysis of the adaptation of the ABIM patient satisfaction survey for resident self-assessment shows highly acceptable levels of internal consistency reliability. In addition, factor analysis shows us the beginning development of two distinct components of professionalism ("interpersonal relations" and "conveying medical information"). These two components allow for the potential creation of separate sub-scales of professionalism. Of particular interest is the overlap on the two components of overall level of professionalism. This overlap could potentially be due to a number of influences. For instance, it could be that both subscales adequately measure overall professionalism and the item is important in both components. One might speculate that items related to "conveying information" are fairly mechanistic, whereas items related to "interpersonal relations" require being more in tune with the patient's emotions. Ginsburg and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] noted that the nature of professionalism is context-specific. Perhaps physicians need to rely on a different set of communication skills depending on the context of the clinical interaction (e.g., delivering a poor prognosis for a cancer versus describing the risks/benefits/alternatives of epidural anesthesia during labor). The issue of "sub-scales" of professionalism could be explored further by administering the survey to patients and residents immediately after a clinical encounter and noting the context of the interaction.</p><p>The results also show significant associations between self ratings and certain participant characteristics. Males tended to rate themselves higher than females on certain items. While this might be their self-perception, reality may prove contrary. In a study by Minter,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] female surgical residents were found to underestimate their skills compared to attending physician evaluation. Additional studies have found that females score better than males after a training course in communication skills, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] female physicians engage in more patient-centered communication than do males,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and female graduates of medical schools outside the U.S. received slightly higher communication and interpersonal skills ratings than did male graduates of medical schools outside the U.S. on the United States Medical Licensing Examination&#x02122; Step 2 Clinical Skills exam.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] When the original ABIM survey was administered to patients for purposes of assessing physicians, female doctors received higher overall professionalism ratings from their patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]</p><p>Foreign graduates reported doing a better job at listening to their patients, whereas U.S. graduates reported using more understandable language. This may have more to do with confidence in English language proficiency rather than basic communication skills; foreign graduates might listen more closely so as not to misunderstand their patients, and their lack of confidence in speaking English might cause them to perceive that they are not speaking in language which is easily understandable to their patients. This would need to be pursued in a further study, particularly comparing resident self-assessment to actual patient perception.</p><p>Surgical residents rated themselves more positively in discussing options with patients compared to residents in non-surgical specialties. The quality of these communication skills has a substantial impact on patient outcomes, including superior recovery rates in patients undergoing surgical procedures,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] reduced need for analgesic use to treat post-operative pain,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and improved emotional and functional adjustment in adult cancer patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] We might speculate that surgery residents' perceptions of their ability to discuss options might be higher than non-surgical residents' because, often in surgery, the options are more concrete (i.e., surgery versus no surgery) whereas patient management options in the non-surgical specialties are often less concrete (i.e., one medication regime versus another medication regime) and perhaps more difficult to articulate to patients.</p><p>Current schemes for evaluating communication skills and professionalism in students and residents have flaws when used in isolation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] For instance, although standardized patients have been shown to be useful in evaluating the mechanics of clinical and communication skills,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] their reliability in assessing elements of professionalism is less established. These settings may also be considered contrived. Faculty evaluations of professional behavior using instruments with Likert scales have been shown to have poor reliability, primarily because the attending physician usually does not interact extensively with the student in the work environment. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] Peer evaluations, though they provide good information about interpersonal skills, are problematic because of the "halo effect" (i.e., if a person is popular, this "halo" may affect the evaluation of specific traits) and because peers are often reluctant to comment on poor behavior in colleagues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] Actual patient evaluations would seem to be the best source of evaluation of communication skills, but can be influenced greatly by the setting in which they are performed.</p><p>Recent reviews of self-assessment in the health professions raise questions about the ability of professionals to generate accurate judgments of their own performance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] Of even more concern is that those who perform the least well on external assessment may also overrate their performance on self-assessment exercises.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] Most studies of self-assessment are in areas of technical knowledge and ability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] Even in concrete areas such as these, self-assessment has been found to be inaccurate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] This may be of even more concern when the area of assessment is laden with value judgments, as is the case in communication skills and professionalism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] In one study, medical residents perceived a high level of competence to discuss end-of-life issues, but failed to engage in recommended behaviors for such discussions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] When surveys use self-assessment, they are subject to social desirability bias.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] This may limit the usefulness of these self-assessments to formative assessment and the formation of personal goals.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]</p><p>It is thought that a more representative picture of professional behavior can be obtained by surveying a variety of patients and people in the healthcare team because they interact with students and residents on a more regular basis and may provide a more informative picture of professional behavior throughout their academic career.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] This type of assessment is referred to as a "360-degree Evaluation." Resident self-assessment of professionalism skills may therefore be more useful when compared with the assessments made by others.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]</p><p>There may also be educational benefit simply by the process of self-reflection. Reflection, both on the process and content of learning can help students to monitor their own learning.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] Reflection-in-learning is related to readiness for self-regulation of learning and may be conducive to enhanced diagnostic ability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] Studies have found that a greater effort of reflection is associated with a more positive or meaningful learning experience.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] The rationale for encouraging reflection in the promotion of self-directed learning is extensive.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] Actually, reflection is conceived as one of the metacognitive skills or cognitive regulation strategies required for the development of self-regulated learning, from a theoretical viewpoint.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Through psychometric analysis, we have shown that the adaptation of the ABIM patient satisfaction survey is reliable for self-assessment of communication skills in residents. Although the face validity of the items has been reviewed elsewhere,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] we hope to further establish the validity of this tool for resident self-assessment by administering the survey to patients and residents immediately following a clinical encounter, and comparing aggregate patient evaluations with the residents' own self-assessment of communication and professionalism skills. Although, as part of the ABIM Maintenance of Certification process, physicians are asked to answer the patient survey questions as a "self-assessment," we are aware of no published studies comparing the physician and patient data. We would like to explore comparing these data with results we have obtained or will obtain in our own studies of resident physicians. We would also like to use the resident self-assessment in conjunction with other resident evaluation methods currently in place at our institution.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ABS: substantial contributions to research design, the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of data; drafting the paper; approval of the submitted and final versions.
