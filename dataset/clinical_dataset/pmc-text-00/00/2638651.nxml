Before the extraction procedures, the patients were prepared with application of cutaneous pads for defibrillation, transvenous temporary pacing, invasive arterial blood pressure, and pulse oximetry monitoring.</p><p>The extraction procedures were performed by three trained interventional cardiologists.</p><p>Once the patient was prepared, draped, and sedated, the pulse generator pocket was opened and the leads freed by electrocauthery from their adhesions down to the venous insertion site or as far as possible. The leads were cut 10&#x02013;15 cm out of the venous entry site. A stiff normal stylet supplied by the lead manufacturer, of appropriate length for the lead, was introduced into the lead body with its tip as close as possible to the lead tip in order to stiffen it. One or two (in the presence of unipolar or bipolar leads, respectively) ties of silk suture material (Ethibond Excel 0, Ethicon, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, St Steven-Woluwe, B) were secured, respectively, around the outer and the inner insulation of the lead. Once the lead was freed and secured, gentle manual traction was applied in an attempt to remove the lead. When manual traction failed to remove the lead, we used a modified percutaneous dilatation technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C20">20</xref></sup></p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>In the presence of leads exposed through tributary veins of the superior vena cava system (cephalic, subclavian, jugular vein) the venous entry site approach (VEA) was the first choice technique. Dilatation was performed using polypropylene sheaths by Cook Vascular Inc. (Leechburg, PA, USA). The size of the sheaths, all provided with bevelled ends, ranged from 7 to 14F. Dilatation was started by using a single sheath with the inner diameter as close as possible to the lead body diameter. Traction was maintained on the silk ties while the sheath was advanced under fluoroscopy following the lead course and avoiding any angle. The advancement of the sheath was made by rotating it alternatively clockwise and counter-clockwise with two or three turns. While dilating, smooth traction was performed in order to keep the lead in tension, but avoiding myocardial wall invagination or coil lengthening and lead damage. When the advancement of the sheath was difficult, it was retrieved for a few millimetres and dilatation restarted. If unsuccessful, the dilator was changed to a new one of larger diameter. Occasionally, instead of moving to a larger sheath, we modified the bevelled end of the dilator sheath. The orifice of the sheath was enlarged by cutting away a small portion of the polypropylene, paying attention to avoid any modification of the distal part of the bevelled edge. Once the tip was reached, while exerting a mild traction and maintaining the stylet inserted till the tip, dilatation was performed by continuous clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation of the sheath, in order to dissect the distal binding site, and checking by fluoroscopy that the sheath did not overcome the tip of the lead. Once the tip was freed, the lead and the sheaths were removed through the vein of insertion. When the lead tip was made free by traction and dilatation before the sheath reached the distal end of the lead, but the retrieval was impossible because of unablated binding sites, then a transfemoral workstation was used for grasping the lead tip and to remove it, by slipping it through the binding sites. When, despite the use of larger sheaths, dilatation was stopped at any binding site for 5 min, or when dilatation was judged too risky, the internal transjugular approach (ITA) was considered. To perform ITA, the transfemoral approach (TFA) was necessary as a crossover step. Procedural steps are shown in <italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHN461F1">1</xref></italic>. The transfemoral workstation, provided with a remote control tip deflecting wire (Cook Vascular Inc., Leechburg, PA, USA), was introduced through the right femoral vein, and advanced till the right atrium. The first step was to check the possibility of slipping the lead into the blood flow (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHN461F1">1</xref>A</italic>). Using the tip deflecting wire, the lead was grasped at the level of the right atrium or superior vena cava, below the site where dilatation was stopped. Using slight traction, the possibility of slipping the lead and making it free-floating was assessed (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHN461F1">1</xref>B</italic>). When the lead could not be slipped through, the possibility of grasping it above the binding site and making it free-floating was checked. After the removal of the stylet and the suture, the lead was made free-floating by traction using the tip deflecting wire. Then the right internal jugular vein was percutaneously cannulated using an 11 French introducer (Avanti +, Cordis Corp., Miami, FL, USA). A Lasso (Osypka GmbH, Grentzig-Whylen, Germany) was advanced through the jugular vein, the proximal end of the lead was captured as close as possible to its end, and the lead was retrieved through the jugular vein and exposed (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHN461F1">1</xref>C</italic>).

In our opinion, the key point for a successful removal is to free the lead from all the adhesions all over its course, instead of freeing the lead tip, so that traction at the tip is not crucial anymore. The key point for safety, in the presence of leads difficult to remove, is to adapt the technique to the specific situation, changing, for example, the venous approach. In our opinion, high success and low complication rates are achieved by avoiding the use of excessive force or powered sheaths to overcome tight binding sites. By the ITA approach, dilatation of dangerous venous binding sites can actually be avoided in many instances as the leads can be retrieved by sliding them down through the scar tissue; only distal or intramyocardial scar tissue has to be dealt with from the jugular approach. According to these observations, we developed a modified mechanical dilatation approach, including standard stylet and single sheath dilatation technique, with crossover to TFA and ITA in case of ineffective entry site removal.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Standard stylet</title><p>Since dissection of binding sites has to be performed by sheaths, the lead must be made as stiff as possible in order to allow a firm hold. As known, a locking stylet allows a strong traction of the lead, but, sometimes, some of them may not be removed. However, locking and traction at the lead tip (i.e. locking stylet) is not a key point because binding sites at the tip have to be overcome by dilatation and rotation of the sheath more than by traction. A standard stylet and a suture, if used with a moderate traction, can accomplish the task with a low risk of removing the outer insulation. The other advantage of the standard stylet is the fact that, being easily removable, it is useful when crossovers to alternative transvenous approach are required.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Single mechanical sheath dilatation</title><p>The use of a single sheath and progressive mechanical dilatation offers a flexible extraction technique, allowing the use of smaller sheaths. Dilatation by rotation of a single smaller sheath is effective for most binding sites along the course of the lead, particularly at the junction between the innominate vein and superior vena cava. In our opinion, the tip can be freed in a safer way by clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation of a single sheath, narrowly tailored around the tip, in order to obtain the avulsion of the tip itself from the scar tissue, instead of heavy traction performed while maintaining the outer sheath against the wall.</p><p>Furthermore, the telescoping sheath, due to its larger diameter, is stiff and more difficult to advance. Failure of dilatation was observed in the presence of calcified adherences or in case of a tortuous course of the lead. In these conditions, the use of powered sheaths, even if more effective and faster than mechanical ones, does not provide any advantage, increasing the risk of complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C30">30</xref></sup> Furthermore, even if requiring less time, the procedure is much more expensive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C18">18</xref></sup> Our results demonstrate that the technique of single sheath mechanical dilatation paired with the appropriate approach in the presence of difficult leads is at least as effective as powered dilatation, with lower cost.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Multiple venous entry site approach</title><p>In our opinion, the use of a single sheath technique with the right internal jugular approach can be a solution in most of the difficult situations previously mentioned (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EHN461TB4">4</xref></italic>). First, withdrawing the lead with a TFA, it may be slipped through some binding sites, avoiding dilatation of some adherences (<italic>Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHN461F2">2</xref>B</italic>). Secondly, once exposed through the jugular vein, free-floating leads and difficult leads turned into free-floating ones may be managed as exposed leads. At this point, mechanical dilatation may be performed via internal jugular vein avoiding some disadvantages resulting from the VEA, such as tight space between the clavicle and the first rib (especially if large sheaths are required) or an unfavourable lead/venous wall angle. Indeed, using ITA we obtain a &#x02018;straight course dilatation&#x02019; from the jugular vein to the heart facilitating force application up to the tip (<italic>Figures&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHN461F1">1</xref>D</italic> and <italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="EHN461F2">2</xref>D</italic>).</p><p>In conclusion, our approach was highly effective considering the characteristics of the removed leads, with a complete success rate slightly higher (98.4%) than that reported in most of the papers about powered dilatation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C26">26</xref></sup> or TFA approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C29">29</xref></sup> and with a low number of complications (0.7%). Indeed, advantages provided by the ITA are unrelated to the energy used for dilatation but depend on a reduced number of binding sites to dissect and on a straighter lead course dilatation, overcoming main limitations resulting from the VEA (such as difficult large sheath advancement, risk of venous tear in presence of lead turns, and tight binding sites),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C16">16</xref></sup> and of conventional TFA (difficult and risky traction).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHN461C29">29</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The present study reports the experience of a single centre with a versatile technique for transvenous lead removal; it is not a prospective randomized trial.</p><p>It requires an adequate training in lead removal to obtain reproducible results.

Removal techniques were first introduced in clinical practice 15 years ago, and are still considered to be in evolution. Further advances are required in order to reach a gold standard. Our technique proved to be very effective and safe. The use of a single sheath method for freeing binding sites and the use of the ITA increased the effectiveness of mechanical dilatation, while avoiding the costs related to the use of powered sheaths. This technique reduces the incidence of serious complications, which can lead in turn to expanded indications for transvenous lead removal.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>Funding to
