The most widely used strategy to link sequence or structure to function, homology-based function prediction, relies on the fundamental assumption that sequence or structural similarity implies functional similarity. New tools that extend this approach are still urgently needed to associate sequence data with biological information in ways that accommodate the real complexity of the problem, while being accessible to experimental as well as computational biologists. To address this, we have examined the application of sequence similarity networks for visualizing functional trends across protein superfamilies from the context of sequence similarity. Using three large groups of homologous proteins of varying types of structural and functional diversity&#x02014;GPCRs and kinases from humans, and the crotonase superfamily of enzymes&#x02014;we show that overlaying networks with orthogonal information is a powerful approach for observing functional themes and revealing outliers. In comparison to other primary methods, networks provide both a good representation of group-wise sequence similarity relationships and a strong visual and quantitative correlation with phylogenetic trees, while enabling analysis and visualization of much larger sets of sequences than trees or multiple sequence alignments can easily accommodate. We also define important limitations and caveats in the application of these networks. As a broadly accessible and effective tool for the exploration of protein superfamilies, sequence similarity networks show great potential for generating testable hypotheses about protein structure-function relationships.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past two decades, there has been a disorderly explosion of biological data, exponentially increasing in volume with time. To keep pace with the broad classes of new sequence, structural, and functional data arising from compilations of genomic and proteomic data in particular, many powerful approaches have been developed for unearthing meaningful themes and hypotheses from within the jumble. Yet there is still a critical need for improved techniques enabling fast and comprehensive analysis of large sequence data sets, especially to access the biologically useful context that can be extracted from this information. There is a particular demand for easy-to-use techniques to aid experimental biologists in finding useful starting points for analyzing diverse superfamilies of proteins. Here we address one of these techniques, sequence similarity networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). A relatively new application of methods commonly used to summarize protein-protein interactions on a large scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Shannon1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, sequence similarity networks&#x02014;here, in which the interrelationships between proteins are described as a collection of independent pairwise alignments between sequences&#x02014;represent an attractive adjunct approach to multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees. Moreover, they offer several important capabilities unavailable to these methods. First, they provide a fast and easy to compute framework for observing relationships among very large sets of evolutionarily related proteins; more importantly, when visualized they also allow the perception of trends in orthogonal information&#x02014;viz., function-related information&#x02014;mapped onto the context of sequence similarity. Because they provide access to these relationships in an intuitively accessible manner and are easy to create and manipulate, these networks fill a need that is not currently well-addressed by other tools. By enabling the visualization of extremely large sets of related sequences, networks provide advantages unmet by phylogenetic trees, particularly in showing all relationships that score above a user-defined similarity cut-off rather than only the small number of optimally scoring connections. Also, for the same amount of computation, a much larger set of sequences can be analyzed using a network than could be used to infer a tree. Furthermore, there are restrictions on the number of sequences that can be usefully considered in generating a multiple sequence alignment, in part due to the practical limitations of viewing alignments of hundreds of sequences. The corresponding benefit of visualizing a sequence similarity network, rather than analyzing it numerically, is that the displayed network can be overlaid with as many types of derived and orthogonal information as spring to mind. The network can then be interactively explored to see how these different features coalesce into trends (or don't) when viewed in the context of sequence similarity. Additionally, using interactive software to visualize the networks (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Shannon1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>) and to link to other types of information such as three-dimensional structures (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Morris1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>) allows the evaluation of individual and sets of edges, enabling an informed researcher to decide how much to trust the relationships implied by the network structure.</p><fig id="pone-0004345-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004345.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Sequence similarity network topology changes in a predictable way with the stringency of the threshold.</title><p>A. Thresholded sequence similarity networks represent sequences as nodes (circles) and all pairwise sequence relationships (alignments) better than a threshold as edges (lines). The same network, depicting three simulated protein classes, is shown here at four different thresholds. At stringent thresholds, the sequences break up into disconnected groups; within each group the sequences are highly similar. The relative positioning of disconnected groups has no meaning, while the lengths of connecting edges tend to correlate with the relative dissimilarities of each pair of sequences. As the threshold is relaxed and edges associated with less significant relationships are added to the network, groups merge together and eventually become completely interconnected. B.

Enright and colleagues recognized that visualizing a network of protein similarity information<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Enright1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> was a useful extension to basic protein sequence clustering methods (e.g. BLASTCLUST<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Altschul1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and cd-hit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Li1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>). They then used the MCL algorithm&#x02014;designed for clustering very large networks&#x02014;to identify natural sequence similarity &#x0201c;families&#x0201d; (ideally, rough functional classes) in a network of the protein universe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Enright2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. A number of other groups followed with innovative approaches to cluster all known proteins and visualize them as attractive, enigmatic maps (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Adai1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>). More recently, there have been efforts to use sequence similarity networks for more discrete sets of related proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Frickey1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and PFAM has released its classification of families into the more general <italic>clans</italic>, creating many three-level hierarchies bundling sequences into families, and families into clans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Finn1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Work by Medini et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Medini1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> began with a sequence similarity network of the protein universe, but also isolated one small and interesting region of the network. Using more careful analyses, they made inferences about the evolution of specific protein families from the isolated region. In our own work, we have begun to use sequence similarity networks to provide context for the analysis of individual proteins that are members of superfamilies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Song1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, to show the relative outlier status of specific functional classes within a large superfamily<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Nguyen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Dvork1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and to illustrate the correlation with lineage of conservation patterns for active site residues in a specific family of enzymes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Hall1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>But before sequence similarity networks can be adopted for broad use, it is important to understand their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, these types of networks need to be validated in comparison to better-understood approaches. A primary motivation of this work is to address whether there is a compelling quantitative argument that sequence similarity networks can competently depict sequence similarity relationships, allowing them to be used as a framework to guide hypotheses about functional relationships. Although it has long been recognized that sequence similarity is an imperfect proxy for functional similarity, a fundamental dogma of structural biology&#x02014;that sequence conservation infers structural conservation, which in turn implies functional conservation&#x02014;has been extensively and effectively applied to infer functional properties on every scale. Consistent with this view, our results demonstrate that visualized sequence similarity networks perform well in representing sequence similarity information, and indeed the visualized relationships correlate well with known functional relationships. In contrast to the formal network representations of sequence similarity represented by previous studies describing algorithms for network generation, we have shown how well the displayed relationships reflect various measures of sequence and evolutionary distance, using relevant examples and quantitative assessments. Additionally, we introduce a concept: the most valuable feature of sequence similarity networks is not the optimal or most accurate display of sequence similarity, but rather the flexible visualization of many alternate protein attributes for all or nearly all sequences in a superfamily. To illustrate the results, we have used three well-studied superfamilies with nuanced functional annotations. This work is especially applicable to the study of individual superfamilies, and is complementary to previous work in this area that typically shows that networks can group all known proteins in agreement with broad definitions of functional similarity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Ashburner1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Here we demonstrate, using example data sets of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), kinases, and the crotonase superfamily of enzymes, that sequence similarity networks recapitulate much of the information present in phylogenetic trees, that the relationships implied by networks are in agreement with known sequence and structural relationships, that networks incorporate a number of practical benefits that improve on current techniques for relating sequences, and finally, that visualization of similarity networks enables the perception of trends from the context of sequence similarity, initiating fruitful hypotheses. Finally, we report a new result relevant to the evolution of domain variation in the crotonase superfamily of enzymes that was obtained from analysis of sequence similarity networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Our results provide validation of sequence similarity networks for establishing family or superfamily context and for illustrating important applications. The first two sections provide quantitative evidence to support our claim that two-dimensional distances in visualized networks correlate well with the underlying distances in high-dimensional space and with distances depicted by phylogenetic trees, indicating that the depictions are mathematically reasonable and comparable to an accepted standard. The next sections address the practical benefits we have found for sequence similarity networks in capturing known (and novel) sequence and structural relationships, and in providing different and new information compared to conventional methods for relating sequences. We also describe some of the important advantages this view of sequence similarity context provides for hypothesis generation about structure-function relationships. This latter application is most powerful when nodes in the network are painted with structural or functional information that is orthogonal to homology-based information. An example is provided by mapping sequence length and taxonomic information onto the crotonase superfamily network, leading to the discovery that there are three major groups within the superfamily that are differentiated by domain organization and that track with primary branching across the tree of life. Each section is accompanied by a brief discussion of the controls and caveats we have found to be important for effective use of this method.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>I.&#x02003;Visualized sequence similarity networks are satisfactory depictions of high-dimensional similarity relationships</title><p>Graph layout algorithms project the N-1 dimensional data structure into two (or three) dimensions for visualization, with the aim being to preserve, as well as possible, the actual pairwise distances between nodes in high dimensional space. In this case, the graphs are made up of nodes (sequences) connected by edges (pairwise similarity relationships). The layout used in this work, the Organic layout<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Wiese1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Wiese2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> available in Cytoscape 2.6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Shannon1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, uses only node connectivity to illustrate groups and inter-group relationships. This makes it suitable for visualizing thresholded sequence similarity networks, where the high-dimensional graph is defined by all pairwise sequence alignments that are better than a chosen cut-off. Because mutual sequence similarity within a protein family and the number of similarity relationships better than a threshold appear to be highly correlated, the Organic layout is able to calculate relative distances in two dimensions that are remarkably close to the underlying, mathematically ideal distances in high dimensional space, without explicitly incorporating numeric edge weights into the algorithm. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004345.s001">Table S1</xref>.) An alternative layout algorithm incorporating edge weights performed slightly worse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004345.s004">Fig. S1</xref>). Across all of the test sets used in this work, the correlation between displayed distances and the mathematically ideal distances defined by BLAST E-values ranges from a low of 0.838&#x000b1;0.002 to a high of 0.936&#x000b1;0.003; the variation in correlation appears to be associated with variations among the specific sets of proteins analyzed, data set curation, and the selected E-value cut-off rather than with the size of the network in terms of nodes and edges (data not shown). The visually discernable clusters tend to overlap with sequence clusters as determined by related approaches, such as the NCBI BLASTCLUST program (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004345.s005">Fig. S2</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we found high correlations between a Class A GPCR network composed of 605 sequences and networks from this set where 20&#x00025; of the sequences were removed at random. To address the impact of missing data on network topology, we compared the laid-out distances between sequences present in the full network and these 80&#x00025; networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004345.s006">Fig. S3</xref>). Here, the average correlation is 0.892 with a standard deviation of 0.016, indicating that the observable distances are very similar. The underlying BLAST-defined distances also remained extremely similar, at 0.993&#x000b1;0.004. The observable distances for the 80&#x00025; network were also very close to the 80&#x00025; BLAST-defined distances (0.901&#x000b1;0.010) as well as to the underlying BLAST distances for the full sequence set (0.894&#x000b1;0.014). Thus, the implied sequence interrelationships do not depend strongly upon the presence of specific sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>II.&#x02003;Sequence similarity networks recapitulate much of the information present in phylogenetic trees</title><p>We examined the similarity relationships implied by phylogenetic trees and networks of two small protein families (amine-binding GPCRs, and the STE and WNK kinases) and the kinase superfamily. Both sequence families are simple to align&#x02014;highly conserved transmembrane helix domains anchor the amine-binding GPCRs, while the STE and WNK kinases have an average percent identity of 36&#x00025; across the alignment. The distances between sequences in a neighbor-joining tree of the 42 human amine-binding GPCRs and the corresponding sequence similarity networks are well correlated (R&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.712; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004345-t001">Table 1</xref>); notably, with this set of proteins annotated by their ligands, the network does as good a job of grouping functionally-similar sequences as the tree. As can be seen in the neighbor-joining tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, most of the clades are about equidistant from one another, with the exception of the muscarinic acetylcholine group, which is slightly more similar to a pair of histamine-binding GPCRs (H3 and H4). These comparatively longer branches are demonstrated in the network, and the intermediate characteristics of a third histamine-binding GPCR, labeled (a) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, are captured both in the tree and the network. A fourth histamine-binding GPCR, labeled (b) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, is closer to the central branch point of the other amine GPCRs than any other sequence in the tree. Accordingly, it is embedded in the larger amine group that is closer to the central branch point relative to the muscarinic acetylcholine and three histamine class sequences in the network. A similar level of correlation was found between trees and displayed distances (0.714) in 51 human STE and WNK kinases, and qualitative features were mirrored as well. Both the tree and the network clearly demonstrate the outlier status of the STE20: STLK kinase domains (labeled (a) in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004345.s007">Fig. S4</xref>).

Thus, networks are not an adequate alternative to a tree, as the interrelationships they depict cannot be used as a basis for inferring evolutionary history. Indeed, there is a fundamental difference between the network composed of nodes representing contemporary protein sequences that may be connected with cycles, and the acyclic Steiner tree with introduced ancestral nodes that can be used to describe a phylogenetic tree. Despite this, and particularly in the case of large networks with many edges, we have found anecdotally that the composition of many independent alignments as a graph projected into two dimensions enables a visual estimate of confidence in a displayed group-wise similarity relationship&#x02014;a single edge representing a pairwise alignment at 22&#x00025; identity may look like noise, but a large number of edges representing slightly different 22&#x00025; identity alignments between different members of the same two discrete groups can be more convincing, particularly when there are known structural and functional relationships between the groups, as in the GPCR networks depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g004">Fig. 4</xref>.

The absence of edges between the Class A GPCRs and a number of decoy &#x0201c;non-GPCRs&#x0201d; is a further check to help evaluate whether or not to trust the implied similarity relationship. Note that this data set is too large to use in generating a phylogenetic tree using conventional methods.</p><p>One important application of sequence similarity networks is using them to form general functional hypotheses for sequences whose molecular functions are unknown. A typical protein superfamily sequence set contains a number of well-known families or characterized groups, as well as other groups that can be confidently classified to the superfamily but which are uncharacterized or for which the evidence for annotation with a more specific family label does not exist. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, those sequences are represented as the red &#x0201c;Class A: Rhodopsin-like&#x0201d; sequences; in 4B, they are represented as the orange &#x0201c;Putative/unclassified GPCRs.&#x0201d; Clearly, the visualized network gives more information about how these sequences fit into the larger context of the superfamily than can be conveyed by a listing of scores or even a multiple alignment or tree. One relatively well-characterized Class A GPCR, Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), is not associated with a more specific ligand class label in this data set, but is nestled in among a number of &#x0201c;Lysosphingolipid and LPA&#x0201d; sequences; this group is unsurprisingly involved in lipid signaling. As the literature shows that endogenous ligands for CB1 are also involved in lipid signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Howlett1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, if CB1 had been uncharacterized, the network topology would have given hints about which sort of ligand class might lead to activation of the protein.</p><p>Another feature accessible from the network representation is so basic that it is easy to overlook&#x02014;networks enable the conversion of lists of labeled protein sequences to a visually intuitive display of the entire data set. Thus, even given the caveats, the network shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> provides a view of broad relationships across the rhodopsin-like GPCRs that is informative in a way not accessible from multiple alignments or trees.

(The other existing GPCR structure&#x02014;rhodopsin from squid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Murakami1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02014;is distant from the human rhodopsins and is not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g004">Fig. 4</xref>.) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, six additional classes from the multiple GPCR superfamilies have been added to the analysis, and in order to observe group-wise connections, the threshold has been scaled back to a statistically insignificant E-value of 1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. While the different classes have long been known to be functionally and structurally related, as recently as 1999 the different groups were described as having no sequence similarity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Bockaert1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Even more than in 4A, the most distant alignments in 4B are expected to have errors; in particular, the single edge between the Class A and Class C sequences in 4B, representing a 22&#x00025; identity alignment over 135 amino acids, potentially represents a specious connection that should be undetectable from sequence information alone. However, despite the serious limitations in using such low significance sequence similarity scores for prediction of functional properties, other evidence exists to suggest that this is a useful representation of the GPCR superfamily. Except for the Class C group, the group-wise clustering is in line with the PFAM clan grouping. PFAM clans represent higher-order groupings of PFAM family models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Finn1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>: the GPCR_A clan includes &#x0201c;Class A: Rhodopsin&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Taste receptors T2R&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Vomeronasal receptors&#x0201d;; the FOCS clan includes &#x0201c;Class B: Secretin-like&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;Frizzled/Smoothened family&#x0201d;; and the &#x0201c;Metabotropic glutamate&#x0201d; group is not included in a clan. This example suggests an important rule of thumb for the use of sequence similarity networks: connections among distant sequence groups based on statistically insignificant scores should not be used for functional prediction without expert knowledge of a system; however, when expert knowledge is available, even poor significance networks may provide useful information for understanding the distribution of a large related sequence set.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>IV.&#x02003;Sequence similarity networks incorporate practical benefits that improve on current techniques for relating sequences</title><p>Not only do sequence similarity networks retain the basic clustering and topology information present in phylogenetic trees, but they may also be a better representation&#x02014;for the purposes of developing hypotheses about protein family sequence and structural interrelationships&#x02014;than phylogenetic trees. Whereas a phylogenetic tree requires the complexity of all of the pairwise relationships in a multiple sequence alignment to be projected down into one dimension, a sequence similarity network can show multiple neighbors for a given sequence. In so doing, the network can reveal sequences that may have sequence characteristics useful for linking divergent clusters in multiple alignments.</p><p>Additionally, it is not necessarily appropriate to include a sequence in a multiple sequence alignment that is firmly in the twilight zone of sequence similarity relative to most of the other sequences in the alignment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Rost1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. A thresholded sequence similarity network allows the researcher to define the minimal level of similarity that is acceptable for use in analysis, and transitive relationships still allow the observation of group-wise similarity without diluting the signal from other more significant relationships. The fact that similarity networks are not based on a single multiple sequence alignment is an important advantage: a good multiple sequence alignment can be very difficult to construct in the case of a large or diverse sequence set. And from a practical standpoint, while it can take weeks or months to curate a global multiple sequence alignment and then wait for phylogenetic inference software to converge on a tree of reasonable quality, all of the networks discussed in this work took between a couple of minutes and a couple of hours to generate on a laptop computer. Researchers can also take advantage of existing resources that facilitate the mapping and interactive visualization of large collections of annotations and protein descriptors used to color network displays (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Shannon1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>).

While the vast majority of kinase domains clearly demonstrate the expected presence of this important catalytic position, there are a number of salient exceptions&#x02014;in particular the catalytically active With No Lysine (WNK) kinase, in which the catalytic lysine accomplishes its role using a different subdomain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Xu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Huang1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since the edges are representations of the local regions of similarity between sequences, as demonstrated in the agreement between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g005">Fig. 5A and 5C</xref>, the topology information does not change dramatically, whether the domain in common is isolated, or is embedded in a larger, multi-domain sequence (the correlation in displayed distances between the two networks is 0.868; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004345.s003">Table S3</xref> for full statistics). However, in the domain-only network, the alignments leading to a similar topology are shorter and have higher sequence similarity, leading to differences in the associated E-values.

In practice, we have found that better resolution can be achieved using networks of full-length sequences, as the greater variation in lengths of alignment and corresponding similarity scores allows a more nuanced discrimination between different groups of proteins. Yet this comes at a risk of including relationships that can be mistakenly attributed to the domain of interest. If an additional domain in common happens to be more conserved than the domain of interest, unexpected edges will link groups that the investigator would expect to find distant from one another. Investigators should weigh these issues and consider their familiarity with the superfamily before interpreting a full-length sequence network in the absence of a comparable single domain network. A useful control we use is to generate networks of each domain in a multidomain set and contrast the results with the network for the full-length proteins. Here, mapping lengths onto the network visualization clearly indicates the existence of domain differences in the ECH family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>); the general crotonase domain tends to be about 250 residues long, and there are a number of families whose full-length sequences are significantly longer, including a subset of ECHs (see the dashed ovals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g005">Fig. 5B and 5C</xref>), 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolases (3HCH), and histone acetyltransferases (HAT).</p><p>Exploration of the domain differences in the enoyl-coA hydratases&#x02014;by mapping species categories onto the network&#x02014;leads to new observations that have not previously been reported. We discern three major groups of ECHs: bifunctional two-domain proteins (including an ECH domain) found in bacteria, metazoans, and plants; these are variously known as multifunctional enzyme MFE-1, peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme, and the alpha subunit of mitochondrial trifunctional protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Bhaumik1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> (here, bECH). A second group of bifunctional proteins is found in archaebacteria (archaeal bECH), and the third group of single domain ECHs (sECH) is found in all branches of the tree of life (also known as hydratase-1). The bifunctional proteins are all more than twice the length of the general ECH domain, because they contain the N- and C-terminal domains associated with 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity (3HCDH_N, and 3HCDH, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Bateman1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>); this reaction is the third step in fatty acid degradation, while ECH catalyzes the second step. The network topology in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g006">Fig. 6A and 6B</xref> indicates that the ECH domain in the archaeal bifunctional proteins is more similar to the sECH ECH domain than either of these two domains is to the ECH in the other bifunctional protein cluster; a look at the underlying alignments indicates that the domain ordering between archaeal and non-archaeal bECH sequences has been reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). A pair of phylogenetic trees&#x02014;one using full-length sequences and the other just the ECH domain from representative sequences&#x02014;implies that the archaeal bECH ECH domain is most similar to the sECH domain (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004345.s008">Fig. S5</xref>); additionally, the significant sequence similarity between each type of ECH domain indicates that the three domain structures most likely arose through an evolutionary mechanism other than convergent evolution.</p><fig id="pone-0004345-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004345.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Domain shuffling in the enoyl-CoA hydratase family.</title><p>The displayed networks contain all 410 enoyl-CoA hydratases from the crotonase superfamily network in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004345-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>.

As shown here, these networks can be used to display distances that are accurate from a mathematical perspective, as well as comparing favorably to an accepted method for establishing molecular similarity, the phylogenetic tree. Sequence similarity networks reiterate known structural and functional relationships, and can be used to analyze very large data sets in a timely manner, allowing many different networks to be explored in the time required to generate a single phylogenetic tree of reasonable quality. However, we see the real promise of this technique as allowing a knowledgeable scientist to observe basic connections and clustering in a protein superfamily of interest in the context of orthogonal information. Thus, a good framework for visualizing networks performs well in recapitulating known group-wise connections and clustering. More critically, it should provide a clear view of all of the proteins in the dataset, and flexibility in mapping different features to the visual display so that large-scale and group-wise trends as well as outlier status can be discerned-the particular network layout algorithm used is not important as long as it adequately represents similarity; there are many ways a layout algorithm can be optimized to correspond more closely to some numerical ideal. Networks can be generated from protein distance data derived from many types of analyses, but for simplicity and because of the advantages of speed and the ability to use very large sets of proteins, we have used BLAST in this paper. Moreover, clustering of proteins can also be obtained in many ways. In this paper, we have used a simple method to underline the value of protein similarity networks when tagged with functional information. While we argue that coming to a final conclusion based on a pairwise BLAST alignment is generally not supportable, visualization of sequence similarity networks provides&#x02014;using even such a simple metric as BLAST&#x02014;an environment for exploring complex protein data sets and the straightforward generation of hypotheses to be tested using more rigorous methods. The developers of Cytoscape are actively working on extending the application to facilitate analysis of sequence similarity networks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Morris2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>; some of the features under development are automated calculation of BLAST-based similarity networks given a list of sequences, clustering algorithms for semi-automated detection of protein groups, and speed and cosmetic improvements to open-source network layout algorithms. Keeping in mind the quality of the underlying data and the caveats discussed here, we encourage the use of sequence similarity networks as a first step in analyzing diverse sequence data sets because of their potential to reveal new and unexpected relationships.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>I.&#x02003;Data set sources</title><p>The human GPCR sequences and ligand-based annotations were extracted from the GPCR NaVa Database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Kazius1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> on Jan. 22, 2008.

The GPCR domain&#x02014;effectively the seven transmembrane helices and connecting loops&#x02014;was then isolated from each sequence by extracting the region of each sequence that aligned to a hidden Markov model (HMM) of the domain. A library of three GPCR domain models was used in this step; only the best model of the three was used to define the domain. The first domain model was based on the GPCR_A PFAM clan alignment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Finn1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>; the alignment was used to train an HMM. The second domain model was based on the FOCS PFAM clan alignment, corresponding to Class B GPCRs; the alignment was clipped to isolate just the region beginning with transmembrane helix 1 and ending with transmembrane helix 7.

An additional 20 sequences were drawn at random from the human proteome to serve as non-GPCR controls; three of these were already annotated as GPCRs and discarded. The remaining 17 non-GPCR sequences were clipped to a length of 289 residues&#x02014;the median length of the GPCR domains in the 766-domain sequence set&#x02014;and included in the network analysis of the two larger GPCR data sets.</p><p>Kinases: Beginning with the 621 human kinase domains, all sequences labeled as pseudogenes were removed, leaving 517 domains.

For this work, pairwise relationships correspond to BLAST alignments associated with an E-value<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Altschul1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The fastest way to construct the network is to use formatdb to create a custom BLAST database of a sequence set of interest, search the database with each individual sequence in the set using blastall, and treat hits to each sequence better than a threshold E-value as edges. However, by using a set of related proteins as a database, the background model assumption that similarity hits will follow an extreme value distribution is violated. Thus, while we use the BLAST E-value rather than the BLAST score to define similarity between sequences because it includes a number of helpful corrections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Altschul2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, it must be considered as a type of score, rather than a true expectation value.</p><p>Additionally, BLAST E-values and scores are not symmetric&#x02014;for a given comparison between two sequences, the alignment, score, and E-value can vary depending on which sequence is used as the query. In tests we performed to adjudicate this issue, we found that 74&#x00025; of the comparisons in a large network have &#x0201c;backward&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;forward&#x0201d; E-values within 5 log units&#x02014;regarding the other 26&#x00025;, the median average log E-values begin at &#x02212;46.5 and decrease as the score asymmetry increases; for our data set, alignments corresponding to log E-values of &#x02212;46.5 had a median percent identity of 35&#x00025; over 290 amino acids (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004345.s009">Fig. S6</xref>). This indicates that the greatest asymmetry is found in the better-scoring comparisons. The networks in this work use the best E-value associated with each pairwise comparison.</p><p>To aid in evaluating the networks, we create quartile plots of alignment percent identity, alignment length, and edge count versus edges binned by associated E-value (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004345.s010">Fig. S7</xref>). This gives a sense of how the alignments change with the E-values, and can assist in picking an informative E-value threshold. For instance, only networks based on alignments that cover at least the length of the domain in common and have greater than 30&#x00025; sequence identity may be of interest. Another simple control we suggest is to add sequences known to be unrelated to the sequence data set to the network (see the discussion in Results Section III). If the selected threshold results in edges between sequences of interest and the sequences known to be unrelated, this is a clear indication that some of the edges at that threshold are at the same level of sequence similarity as background noise.</p><p>Sequence similarity networks in this work are visualized using the Organic layout<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Wiese1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Wiese2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> in Cytoscape 2.6<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004345-Shannon1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, with the exception of the comparison between the Organic layout and the Cytoscape force-directed layout weighted by BLAST E-value shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004345.s004">Fig. S1</xref>.

In order to compare a network, which contains cycles and many edges, to a tree, which has no cycles and few edges, we treat both networks and trees as graphs and calculate the shortest paths between each pair of sequences through the graph, using the &#x02212;log<sub>10</sub> edge E-values (BLAST), displayed edge lengths (Organic layout), and edge lengths from the Neighbor-Joining algorithm (trees) as edge weights.
