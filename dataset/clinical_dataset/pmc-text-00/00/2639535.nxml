The purpose of this study was to investigate expression of Fgf2 in rodent and human developing CPe and possible function of Fgf2, using <italic>in vitro </italic>models. The application of Fgf2 to brain <italic>in vivo </italic>can affect the whole tissue, making it difficult to assess specific responses of the CPe.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Expression of Fgf2 was studied by immunohistochemistry in rodent and human embryonic choroid plexus.

Parallel analysis of Fgf2 expression and cell proliferation during CP development suggests that Fgf2 is not involved in CPe proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consistent with this observation is the failure of Fgf2 to increase proliferation in the tri-dimensional vesicle culture model. The CPe however, can respond to Fgf2 treatment, as the diameter of CPe vesicles is significantly increased by treatment with this growth factor. We show that this is due to an increase in cell aggregation during vesicle formation rather than increased secretion into the vesicle lumen. Finally, Fgf2 regulates expression of the CPe-associated transcription factors, <italic>Foxj1 </italic>and <italic>E2f5</italic>, whereas transthyretin, a marker of secretory activity, is not affected by Fgf2 treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fgf2 expression early in the development of both human and rodent choroid plexus, and its ability to modulate behaviour and gene expression in CPe, supports the view that Fgf signalling plays a role in the maintenance of integrity and function of this specialized epithelium, and that this role is conserved between rodents and humans.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The choroid plexus epithelium (CPe) is a specialized neuroepithelium that is involved in secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the cerebral ventricles and in maintaining the homeostasis of the brain during development and throughout life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Most CSF is secreted by the CPe and is re-absorbed mainly at the site of the arachnoid villi. Knockout of genes expressed in the CPe, such as <italic>E2f5</italic>, a member of a family (<italic>E2f1&#x02013;E2f6</italic>) of transcriptional regulators, <italic>FoxJ1</italic>, a member of the forkhead-box (Fox)/winged helix gene family, and <italic>p73</italic>, have been associated with hydrocephalus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The mechanisms leading to the apparently non-obstructive hydrocephalus in these mutants appear to differ and have yet to be fully elucidated. These genes are expressed early during CPe development in rodent and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and <italic>Foxj1 </italic>has been reported to be down-regulated by Fgf2 (fibroblast growth factor 2) in neural cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Some biogenic amines, neuropeptides and hormones also have the ability to modulate the function of the CPe, including its secretory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], but the effect of growth factors on its cellular function has not been well studied, especially in the embryonic CPe. Fgf2 has been implicated in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis, adhesion, motility, and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and in the brain, among other effects, in the control of neural stem cell proliferation both during development and in the adult following intraventricular administration. It has also been suggested that Fgf treatment can stimulate neurogenesis and aid repair following brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Injection of Fgf2 into the ventricles of the brain, however, has been reported to induce hydrocephalus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This could be a hindrance in the development of Fgf-based treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], as the mechanisms underlying the effect of Fgf2 on CSF accumulation remain unclear. Given that Fgf can affect several cell types in the brain, induction of hydrocephalus following Fgf administration might not be due to a direct effect of Fgf on the CPe. On the other hand, Fgf2 might directly affect CSF secretion or reabsorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or even CSF circulation. For example, defects in ciliogenesis, as reported in the <italic>FoxJ1 </italic>knock-out mouse, can affect CSF dynamics in the ventricles and result in hydrocephalus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>As members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family (FgfR 1&#x02013;4) are expressed in the CPe and are differentially regulated during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], it is likely that Fgf signalling can directly affect at least some aspects of CPe cell behaviour. While <italic>in vitro </italic>models cannot reproduce the complexity of the responses leading to the hydrocephalic phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>, they can allow the direct effects of Fgf on CPe cells to be tested.</p><p>At least one FgfR ligand, Fgf2, is known to be expressed in the adult and foetal CPe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], but its expression during early development has not been investigated either in rodents or humans. We have therefore assessed Fgf2 pattern of expression during mouse and human CP development in relation to proliferation. Having found that Fgf2 protein is expressed both in human and mouse embryonic choroid plexus, we have used embryonic CP cells cultured in Matrigel to investigate putative roles of Fgf2 on CPe behaviour. In this tri-dimensional matrix, embryonic CP cells form fluid-filled spherical structures called vesicles, and we have recently shown that their growth depends on secretion within the lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The CPe phenotype and the behaviour of the cells in this culture system appear to be very similar to that <italic>in vivo</italic>, representing a valuable model to assess the effect of growth factors on cell-cell adhesion and cell migration as well as fluid secretion and solute transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This is further supported by this study, as we show that Fgf2 does not affect CPe proliferation <italic>in vitro </italic>in a tri-dimensional environment, consistent with the significant Fgf2 expression and limited proliferation observed in the choroid plexus <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also show that whereas Fgf2 treatment <italic>in vitro </italic>affects CPe vesicle formation in a dose-dependent fashion, it does not alter its secretory activity. Fgf2, however, can regulate expression of the CPe-associated transcription factors <italic>E2f5 </italic>and <italic>FoxJ1</italic>. Altogether this study suggests that Fgf signalling plays a role in CPe development and possibly in its integrity and homeostasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue collection and reagents</title><p>Choroid plexus for cultures, and brains to be fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded for immunohistochemistry were dissected from out-bred CD-1 albino mice supplied by Charles River Mouse Farms (Kent, UK) and housed under Home Office regulations.

Therefore, this study investigated whether Fgf2 is present in the early embryonic mouse and human CP by immunohistochemistry. In the E12.5 mouse IVth ventricle CP, Fgf2 protein was strongly expressed in the epithelium and more weakly in the mesenchyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;B</xref>), and its expression was maintained at E16.5 (not shown). High levels of Fgf2 protein were also detected in both IVth and lateral ventricle CPe of human embryos at 8 weeks of gestation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x02013;E</xref>). To establish whether Fgf2 is expressed in dividing CP cells, we analysed E12.5 mouse IV and lateral ventricle CPe using the mitotic marker, p-H3 (phosphorylated histone 3). Very rarely p-H3 staining was observed in IVth and lateral ventricle CPe, whereas cells of the ventricular zone were frequently labelled (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F&#x02013;G</xref>). Some p-H3 positive cells were observed in the CP stalk of the IV ventricle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>).

We first studied the effect of different doses of Fgf2 on the proliferation of TRCSFB-2 cells (data not shown). Fgf2 significantly increased anti BrdU incorporation at 1 and 10 ng/ml compared to controls (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001). However, with increasing dose of Fgf2 the stimulation of cell proliferation declined and at the highest Fgf2 concentration tested (100 ng/ml) no difference in TRCSFB-2 proliferation was observed compared to untreated controls. Similarly, 10 ng/ml Fgf2 significantly increased cell proliferation in primary embryonic CPe cells grown as monolayers (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001) (data not shown). Unlike in CPe monolayers, very few cells in control vesicles were mitotic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;B</xref>), and the effect of 10 ng/ml Fgf2 on p-H3 expression was not significant either in 1 day cultures (not shown) or in 4 day vesicle cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

At all Fgf2 concentrations the vesicle diameter is significantly higher than in controls (p &#x0003c; 0.001). (C) Graph showing the average vesicle diameters of control vesicles (n = 96) and vesicles treated with 10 ng/ml Fgf2 from day 6 in culture (n = 110). The results were not significant.

They also show that the behaviour of CPe cells in response to Fgf2 depends on the culture environment, given the difference in proliferative effect in monolayer and 3-dimensional (3D) cultures.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of Fgf2 on CPe vesicle secretion</title><p>Analysis of vesicle growth rate showed that the average rate of increase in diameter assessed between 4 and 10 days in culture was the same for control and Fgf2-treated CPe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This suggests that Fgf2 does not increase fluid secretion into the lumen, as it has been shown that vesicle growth rate is mainly due to secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, when Fgf2 was added to the cultures at 6 days (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), no significant difference in cell diameter between treated and untreated vesicles was observed at 10 days in culture.</p><p>To further confirm that Fgf2 does not principally affect fluid secretion, we studied its effects on vesicle recovery after inducing them to collapse with secretion inhibitors. Vesicles were cultured for eight days, either with or without 10 ng/ml Fgf2, and then treated for two days with 5 mM ouabain and 100 &#x003bc;M acetazolamide. The effect of Fgf2 on the recovery in size of collapsed vesicles was then assessed by measuring their area daily over eight days (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Since the original vesicles were of variable size, the recovery of each vesicle was expressed as percentage of its area before addition of ouabain and acetazolamide (% recovery). The recovery rates of the vesicles were compared between the two groups using a multilevel model (which accounted for the within vesicle correlation of repeat measurements). The average percentage increase in control vesicle size at each day was 1.19 times higher (95% confidence interval: 1.17, 1.20) than the previous day (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Fgf2-treated vesicles recovered slightly less rapidly than non-treated vesicles, but the difference between control and Fgf2 treatment groups was not significant. These results suggest that fluid secretion rate is not altered by Fgf2 treatment, and that the observed increase in vesicle size must be induced through different mechanisms at early stages of vesicle formation.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of Fgf2 on recovery of collapsed vesicles</bold>.

To this purpose we treated CPe with 10 ng/ml Fgf2, starting the treatment one day after plating on to Matrigel. This allowed us to check that the cultures were at a similar density before addition of the growth factor, and to control for possible variability between experiments carried out from different preparations. The aggregates in Fgf2-treated cultures appeared already to be larger than controls after one day of treatment (2 days in culture), fusing with each other much more frequently (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;B</xref>). After three to four days the aggregates became hollow and formed vesicles that were larger than those in control cultures. As shown by time-lapse photography, both treated and untreated vesicles were highly pulsatile (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Fgf2 effect on early CPe vesicle formation</bold>.

Note that on day 1, just before adding Fgf2 to the cells, CPe aggregates in (A) and (B) are similar in size. On day 2, Fgf2-treated CPe cells have formed bigger aggregates that are fewer in number compared to non-treated cells. On day 4, vesicles in the Fgf2-treated culture are larger than in control culture, but fewer in number.

The average size difference between control and Fgf2 treated cultures is 462.5 &#x003bc;m<sup>2 </sup>(SEM: 87.25 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>), and Fgf2-treated aggregates increase every day on average by 492.03 &#x003bc;m<sup>2 </sup>(compared to control aggregates.

Data are means &#x000b1; SEM.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-8454-5-20-5"/></fig><p>In order to quantify the effect of 10 ng/ml Fgf2, we measured the mid-plane area of CPe aggregates and vesicles in four separate cultures (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Regression analysis revealed that for every day of growth, Fgf2-treated aggregates and vesicles increased in size by an additional 492.03 &#x003bc;m<sup>2 </sup>(SEM: 35.72) per day compared to control cultures, and that this effect was highly significant (p &#x0003c; 0.01). We quantified the number of aggregates forming in control and treated cultures, and found that their number was significantly lower in Fgf2-treated cultures than in controls both at one day (two days after plating) and 3 days (4 days after plating) treatment (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>), as expected given the greater number of cells recruited into each vesicle.</p><p>No obvious change in cell motility was observed when cells were treated with 10 ng/ml Fgf2 at the time of plating. Cell migration was further assessed by measuring the average speed of individual cells in control and 100 ng/ml Fgf2-treated cultures, to assess whether a change in motility might be more obvious at this higher dose that induces formation of larger vesicles. The speed of cell migration was computed by taking the total distance a cell migrated before incorporation into an aggregate over the amount of time taken to do so. In control cells the average speed was 20.29 &#x000b1; 4.84 &#x003bc;m/h, and in Fgf2-treated cells the average speed was 20.48 &#x000b1; 1.45 &#x003bc;m/h. The difference in cell motility was not significant. This suggests that changes in cell-cell adhesion, rather than cell motility, are likely to be responsible for the formation of bigger aggregates and consequently larger vesicles in Fgf2-treated cultures.</p></sec><sec><title>Fgf2 regulation of genes associated with CPe function</title><p>In order to gain further insight into the possible function of Fgf2 we investigated its effects on the expression of E2f5, FoxJ1, p73 and transthyretin (TTR), a protein synthesized and secreted by the CPe. As the TRCSFB-2 cells appeared to behave in a similar fashion to primary mouse CPe monolayers when treated with Fgf2 and a large number of these cells can be easily grown, the effect of different concentrations of Fgf2 (1 ng/ml, not shown, 10 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml) on gene expression was assessed using semi-quantitative RT-PCR in TRCSFB-2 cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

As FgfRs are also expressed in the developing choroid plexus in both species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], it is likely that Fgf2 can behave in an autocrine fashion <italic>in vivo</italic>, consistent with its ability to respond to Fgf2 <italic>in vitro </italic>demonstrated in this study.</p><p>Analysis of Fgf2 expression, cell division during development, and the effect of Fgf2 on CP cells cultured in Matrigel suggest that this growth factor does not play a key role in CPe growth. Whilst the concentrations of the growth factor used here (mainly 10 ng/ml) and in many <italic>in vitro </italic>studies may seem high in comparison to that in CSF <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], it is the concentration of Fgf2 at the cell surface which is critical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. As discussed above, autocrine and paracrine Fgf signalling is likely to occur in the CPe, and Fgf2 availability is regulated by the extracellular matrix. Although in our 3D culture system the bioavailability of Fgf2 may be modified as a result of interactions with the extracellular matrix, a clear effect on vesicle size was observed at all the concentrations tested.</p><p>Whereas CP cells in Matrigel are not induced to proliferate in response to Fgf2, CP cells grown as monolayers, either on laminin or collagen, significantly increase their proliferative activity in the presence of low/medium Fgf2 concentrations. This different proliferative response may be largely due to the differences in culture architecture in the two models. CPe morphology is different in these two culture conditions, with cells being initially rounded and then tightly packed to form a simple polarized epithelium in Matrigel, and well-spread and flat in monolayers. An environment-dependent proliferative effect of Fgf2 on CPe cells is also consistent with previous work showing that these cells behave differently when plated on different matrices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. These authors tested growth factors present in trace amounts in Matrigel, Tgf&#x003b2;1, Tgf&#x003b2;2 and Pdgf, for their ability to increase penetration of CPe into matrices, and suggested that Tgf&#x003b2;2, but not Tgf&#x003b2;1 and Pdgf, can increase migration depending on matrix composition. A role of the environment in Fgf2-induced proliferative response is also consistent with <italic>in vivo </italic>studies reporting increased proliferation in Fgf2-treated CPe in pathological conditions, such as in a Parkinson's disease model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], but no obvious size changes in the CPe of normal animals that developed Fgf2-induced hydrocephalus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Fgf2 increases CPe cell aggregation rather than secretion</title><p>It has been previously shown that growth of CPe vesicles depends on fluid secretion within the lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Analysis of vesicle growth rate has shown that Fgf2-induced increase in vesicle size is not due to increased secretion into the lumen. The slopes of the growth curves of vesicles exposed to different Fgf2 concentrations are very similar, and no increase in the rate of recovery of vesicles collapsed using secretion inhibitors is induced by Fgf2 treatment. In addition, if Fgf2 treatment is started at 6 days, once the vesicles have already formed, no increase in vesicle size is observed in treated cultures 4 days later. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of Fgf2-treated vesicles (not shown) is also consistent with lack of significant Fgf2 effects on secretion, as no obvious reduction in electron density, which is thought to decrease in CPe with very high secretory activity, is observed in these vesicles. Our results <italic>in vitro </italic>are consistent with work suggesting that the occurrence of hydrocephalus observed in response to Fgf2 treatment <italic>in vivo </italic>is not caused by a direct effect of Fgf2 on CPe secretion, but could be due, at least in part, to a decrease in CSF absorption caused by impaired function of the arachnoid villi, the main structure involved in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Fgf2-induced vesicle growth is due to increased CPe cell recruitment into the aggregates that form vesicles, as indicated by a reduced number of aggregates and increase in aggregate size in the presence of Fgf2. The mechanisms underlying increased cell recruitment leading to formation of larger aggregates have yet to be fully elucidated, but the present results suggest an increase in cell-cell adhesion rather than in cell motility. Fgf2-treated aggregates appear more compact than controls. Time-lapse microscopy analysis has not indicated any obvious increase in cell motility in the presence of Fgf2 and, as discussed earlier, proliferation does not appear to contribute to increased aggregate size. E-cadherin could be a candidate mediator of the effect of Fgf in the CPe, as it is expressed in adult CP and Fgf treatment can upregulate E-cadherin expression in pancreatic cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. A thorough adhesion molecule profile of the CPe is required to identify putative Fgf targets leading to increased cell aggregation.</p><p>The fact that Fgf2 is expressed early during choroid plexus development and appears to affect CPe cell-cell interaction, rather than cell proliferation, is consistent with a role of Fgf2 in maintaining the integrity of this epithelium as recently suggested for endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Fgf2 modulates expression of transcription factors associated with CPe homeostasis</title><p>The effect of Fgf2 on <italic>E2f5 </italic>and <italic>Foxj1 </italic>is of particular interest, given the putative roles of these transcription factors in the CPe.

Furthermore, Fgf2 is likely to play a role in maintaining CPe integrity and function, as suggested by the increase in CP cell aggregation and modulation of gene expression observed <italic>in vitro</italic>. In order to better understand the role of Fgf2 on cell-cell interaction it will be important to identify which cell-cell adhesion molecules might be modulated by Fgf2 in the CPe either at the mRNA or protein level and other Fgf ligands that may be crucial for Fgf signalling in the CPe.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SG and AS carried out the experimental work, contributed to its design, interpretation of the results and to the first draft of the manuscript.
