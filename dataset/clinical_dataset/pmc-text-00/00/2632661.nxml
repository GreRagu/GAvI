To provide a framework for local healthcare organisations considering the effectiveness of clinical pathways as a patient management strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>As participants, we considered hospitalized children and adults of every age and indication whose treatment involved the management strategy "clinical pathways". We include only randomised controlled trials (RCT) and controlled clinical trials (CCT), not restricted by language or country of publication. Single measures of continuous and dichotomous study outcomes were extracted from each study. Separate analyses were done in order to compare effects of clinical pathways on length of stay (LOS), hospital costs and patient outcomes. A random effects meta-analysis was performed with untransformed and log transformed outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total 17 trials met inclusion criteria, representing 4,070 patients. The quality of the included studies was moderate and studies reporting economic data can be described by a very limited scope of evaluation. In general, the majority of studies reporting economic data (LOS and hospital costs) showed a positive impact. Out of 16 reporting effects on LOS, 12 found significant shortening. Furthermore, in a subgroup-analysis, clinical pathways for invasive procedures showed a stronger LOS reduction (weighted mean difference (WMD) -2.5 days versus -0.8 days)).</p><p>There was no evidence of differences in readmission to hospitals or in-hospital complications. The overall Odds Ratio (OR) for re-admission was 1.1 (95% CI: 0.57 to 2.08) and for in-hospital complications, the overall OR was 0.7 (95% CI: 0.49 to 1.0). Six studies examined costs, and four showed significantly lower costs for the pathway group. However, heterogeneity between studies reporting on LOS and cost effects was substantial.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>As a result of the relatively small number of studies meeting inclusion criteria, this evidence base is not conclusive enough to provide a replicable framework for all pathway strategies. Considering the clinical areas for implementation, clinical pathways seem to be effective especially for invasive care. When implementing clinical pathways, the decision makers need to consider the benefits and costs under different circumstances (e.g. market forces).</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Clinical pathways represent a form of "cookbook medicine" that many perceive as an appropriate tool that contributes to quality management, cost-cutting and patient satisfaction.</p><p>For the aim of this review, clinical pathways are defined as complex interventions consisting of a number of components based on the best available evidence and guidelines for specific conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A clinical pathway defines the sequencing and timing of health interventions and should be developed through the collaborative effort of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other associated health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Clinical pathways aim to minimize delays and maximize resource utilization and quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. They are also referred to as "integrated care pathways", "critical pathways", "care plans", "care paths", "care maps" and "care protocols".</p><p>The effectiveness of clinical pathways is under debate. However, especially in the US, up to 80 percent of hospitals already use clinical pathways for at least some indications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A number of primary studies considered the effectiveness of clinical pathways, but results are inconsistent and suffer from various biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Only one systematic review has been performed, specifically for stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Narrative reviews are more common, which often rely on "expert opinions" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>We perform a systematic review and a random effects meta-analysis to assess whether clinical pathways improved the outcome measures "length of stay (LOS)", "hospital costs" and "quality of care" when compared to standard care. By performing a systematic review and meta-analysis we are able to present the available evidence in a substantiated and concise way, in order to provide a framework for local healthcare organisations considering the effectiveness of clinical pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We followed the methods of the Cochrane Collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] with some modifications, mainly concerning presentation of meta-analytic results.</p><sec><title>Study selection criteria</title><p>As potential patient samples we considered hospitalized children and adults of every age and indication, whose treatment involved the management strategy "clinical pathways". Given the problem that there are variations in the terminology used in the current research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we defined minimum "inclusion criteria" for meeting our clinical pathway definition (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Based on our definition (see background), we developed a pre-specified, three operational pathway criteria as follows: 1) multidisciplinary (two or multiple clinical professions involved), 2) protocol or algorithm based (i.e. structured care plan/treatment-protocol or algorithm) and finally, 3) evidence based (pathway components were minimally based on one RCT or best practice guidelines). Every pathway characteristic could be met as (1) "yes" criterion; (2) "not sure" because of poor reporting and the failure to contact the principal author or (3) "criterion not met." If one or more pathway criteria selected is not met, then we excluded the study.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Pathway characteristics and quality outcome measures of studies included</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Pathway</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Charac-teristics</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left"><bold>Quality Measure</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Pathway [n/N]</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Control [n/N]</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Study-ID</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>multi-disciplinary</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>evidence-based</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>protocol/algorithm based</bold></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold>Counts and rates are presented in natural units and as percentages as far as reported</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>N = numer of participants n = number of events (%) = percentage</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Invasive Care</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Grines, CL</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="left">In-hospital complications</td><td align="center">20/237 (8.4%)</td><td align="left">20/234 (8.5%) N.S.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">1998</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="left">Re-hospitalisation (6 months)</td><td align="center">10/237 (4.2%)</td><td align="left">9/234 (3.9%) N.S.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Swanson, CE</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="center">Not</td><td align="center">X</td><td align="left">Hospital mortality</td><td align="center">2/38 (5.2%)</td><td align="left">2/33 (6.1%) N.S.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">1998</td><td></td><td align="center">sure</td><td></td><td align="left">Mean Modified Barthel Index</td><td align="center">92.8</td><td align="left">85.6 (p &#x0003c;

Prior to the actual statistical pooling of the singular effects, an adjustment of the data regarding costs due to inflation and price adjustment (OECD Health Care Price Index) was carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We chose the US Dollar (USD) as the basic currency.

The randomization process was clear in all such studies and justified by the authors. Referring to the individually randomized and single-center studies, the assessment of protection against contamination of the control professionals remained unclear due to poor reporting. None of the investigators reported protection against contamination (communication between experimental and control professionals) and it is possible that control subjects received the intervention. Only the investigation from Marie et al. used a robust cluster randomized design, with 19 hospitals as unit of allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To avoid "unit of analysis error," we conducted the meta-analysis at the same level as the allocation (19 cluster-hospitals = 19 patients).</p><p>Poor reporting also lead to difficulties in determining the assessment of the power calculations. For instance, sample-size calculation was unclear for over 60% of the included studies; hence the study sample may not have been sufficiently large. Another problem, due to poor reporting was the selection of comparators. The choice of the comparator (i.e. the control and intervention units were located either in the main building or the east building of the participating hospital) was stated and justified by the authors of the 17 primary studies. However, a clear description of what was meant by traditional care or usual care (control group) would have helped in assessing the relevance of the study to other settings.</p><p>Primary studies reporting economic data, can be described by a very limited scope of evaluation, focusing on direct hospital LOS and costs effects, rather than on a full economic evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Furthermore, pathways for invasive procedures showed a stronger LOS reduction by comparing the magnitudes of effect.

Both trends were not statistically significant but they were in contrast to the majority of pathway effects reported in the present review. However, the question of comparability may rise as a reflection of the differing pathway components included in this review and also applies to the kind and number of providers included in the primary studies.</p><p>We did not publish our review protocol prior to the study. The review protocol for the follow-up study will be published as a Cochrane review to prevent any doubt about the comparison to be data-driven instead of protocol-driven. We determined the scope of this review question on a pilot analysis of existing primary study data resulting in a diverse set of included studies. As it is an explanatory analysis, the pooled results of the meta-analyses may only apply for the majority of included pathway conditions reporting positive effects or trends. Another limitation refers to the poorly described control conditions reported in the primary studies and implied both, the risk of contamination, and the masking of effects. Therefore, we did not pool the primary LOS and costs data from all of the 17 included studies and concentrated on examining the relationship between clinical subgroups (i.e. surgical versus non-invasive pathway conditions).</p><p>It should be noted that the development and implementation of clinical pathways consumes a considerable amount of resources. This corresponds to the fact that truly achievable costs savings depend on the number of cases (volume). This has to be included in the costs analysis. The inflation-adjusted costs for implementation (without maintenance and further development) of the pathway indication "Caesarian section" amounted to nearly $20,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, since normally 20 percent of the diagnoses cover 80 percent of the cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], a considerable percentage of medical services can be dealt with using a relatively small number of clinical pathways. Therefore, the expenditures will amortize rapidly.</p><p>It is very important not to look too far into these results, as there were some limitations. Moreover, it has to be emphasised that evidence determined by meta-analysis is always exploratory in nature and should be considered with caution.</p><p>Due to the result of the relatively small number of studies meeting inclusion criteria, this evidence base is not conclusive enough to provide a replicable framework for all pathway strategies. Considering the clinical areas for implementation, clinical pathways seem to be effective especially for invasive care. The likely benefits and costs need to be considered by the local healthcare providers when implementing clinical pathways under different circumstances. This review has shown that there is not one, singular strong evidence base. Accordingly, decision-makers should also consider some limitations in relation to the generalization of these findings. Replicating the results of this review in other settings could be problematic (e.g. ceiling effects such as market forces).</p><p>The heterogeneity in design and outcomes of the studies was large and refers to the statistical heterogeneity in addition to the clinical variability of the included studies. This precluded the overall pooling of LOS and cost data, although the order of magnitude of effects indicated that there are considerable implications of using clinical pathways.</p><p>It is unavoidable that some studies will have been overlooked, despite our electronic search strategy. Studies meeting our clinical pathway definition (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>) were included, regardless of the fact that the term pathway was mentioned in the study and was done to avoid subjectivity. Also, studies were independently assessed and data extracted by two with any disagreement discussed with a third reviewer.</p><p>Finally, should be emphasised that the standard of the primary studies included pose a threat to the validity of the results. While the overall quality of the included studies was moderate, most demonstrated methodological weaknesses such as a small sample size available for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>With respect to the totality of available evidence, the knowledge about the mechanisms through which pathways work is insufficient. Future research should focus on a better understanding of the key elements of clinical pathways that have impact on economic and patient outcomes. It is also surprising that more studies do not consider any cost effects other than those of treatment. Health-economic research should therefore concentrate on costs of development and implementation of clinical pathways.</p><p>This investigation is the first systematic review regarding the effects of clinical pathways on process and patient outcomes. We explicitly decided to expand this review and will also include less restrictive study designs in addition to randomized and quasi-randomized trials, to provide a comprehensive theoretical basis. The character of non-experimental studies makes them even more difficult to critically assess and moreover, due to the lack of MeSH terms the search results cannot be as sensitive as those for purely RCT/CCT-based reviews. Another future direction is a more comprehensive, patient-centered approach, concentrating more on patient-outcomes rather then health-economic study endpoints. The next scheduled update for this review is planned for the End of 2009.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TR: Made substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data.
