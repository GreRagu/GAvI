We discovered five mutations E69K, E302R, W313F, L435G and N454K that collectively increase the half-life of MMLV RT at 55&#x000b0;C from less than 5 min to &#x0223c;30 min in the presence of template-primer. In addition, these mutations alter the thermal profile by increasing specific activity of the pentuple mutant (M5) over a broad range of cDNA synthesis temperatures (25&#x02013;70&#x000b0;C). We further show that M5 generates higher cDNA yields and exhibits better RT&#x02013;PCR performance compared to wild-type RT when used at high temperature to amplify RNA targets containing secondary structure. Finally, we demonstrate that M5 exhibits tighter binding (lower <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) to template-primer, which likely protects against heat inactivation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Reverse transcriptases are derived from RNA-containing retroviruses and are either monomeric (e.g. Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus, MMLV RT) or heterodimeric (e.g. Avian Myeloblastosis Virus, AMV RT) in structure. Reverse transcriptases are multi-functional enzymes with three enzymatic activities including RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerization activity, and an RNase H activity that catalyses the cleavage of RNA in RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>MMLV RT is widely used in a number of research applications, including cDNA cloning, end-point and real-time RT&#x02013;PCR, microarray analysis and RACE. The associated RNase H activity of MMLV RT, which is instrumental to biological activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, limits the efficiency of synthesizing long cDNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). This problem was overcome with the development of mutants that exhibit diminished RNase H activity (H<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MMLV RT), while retaining full RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Besides providing improved synthesis of full-length cDNA, H<sup>&#x02013;</sup> MMLV RT exhibits higher thermostability (4-fold longer half-life at 50&#x000b0;C) compared to wild-type MMLV RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Another challenge to copying RNA is the presence of RNA secondary structure which can stall cDNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), resulting in truncated cDNA molecules. Interference from RNA secondary structure can be overcome by performing cDNA synthesis at higher temperature. For example, MMLV RT is generally recommended for use at 37&#x000b0;C (or 42&#x000b0;C for H<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MMLV RT), and increased temperatures (e.g. by up to 8&#x000b0;C) are advocated for relaxing RNA secondary structure and improving transcription of problematic sequences. Increasing cDNA synthesis temperature has also been reported to reduce non-specific priming and increase MMLV RT fidelity by lowering the stability of mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Ultimately, however, cDNA length and yield are compromised by lower enzyme activity and reduced RNA integrity at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Although several strategies have been used to facilitate cDNA synthesis above 50&#x000b0;C, each has disadvantages that limit utility. For example, cDNA synthesis can be performed at PCR temperatures using thermophilic DNA-dependant DNA polymerases with low intrinsic reverse transcriptase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>), that can be further enhanced by substituting Mn<sup>2+</sup> for Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Under these conditions, pausing at secondary structures is minimized; however, cDNA synthesis itself is relatively inefficient and highly error-prone [Mn<sup>2+</sup>is mutagenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>)]. To increase efficiency and fidelity, thermophilic DNA polymerases have been further engineered to improve utilization of RNA templates in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18">15&#x02013;18</xref>); those that are commercially available allow single-enzyme RT&#x02013;PCR but target-length capability is limited. Methods that provide efficient reverse transcription at higher non-PCR temperatures (up to 55&#x02013;65&#x000b0;C) include the use of avian RTs (e.g. AMV RT) and enhancing the thermoactivity of MMLV RT with stabilizers. While AMV RT retains more DNA synthetic activity at elevated temperatures than MMLV RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) (<italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> 45&#x02013;50&#x000b0;C; recommended up to 60&#x000b0;C), avian RTs are less commonly used perhaps because the reverse transcription yield (cDNA conversion efficiency) for AMV RT is significantly lower than MMLV RT (2% for AMV compared to 44% for MMLV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>In the presence of trehalose, H<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MMLV RT was shown to retain full activity up to 60&#x000b0;C; however, effective concentrations (0.6 M) are inhibitory to PCR, precluding its use in one-tube RT&#x02013;PCR formats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Efforts to engineer MMLV RT mutants with increased thermostability have also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). As mentioned above, MMLV RT mutants lacking RNase H activity also show greater resistance to thermal inactivation in the presence of template-primer. In this case, differences in thermostability are attributed to differences in the degree of protection provided by intact (H<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MMLV RT) versus degraded RNA:DNA templates (RNA portion degraded by wild-type RNase H activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Additional mutations have been reported to increase the intrinsic stability of H<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MMLV RT without affecting template binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>); however, the identity of such mutations has not been disclosed (e.g. SuperScript III RT, Invitrogen).</p><p>In this study, we expand upon earlier efforts to increase the thermal activity of MMLV RT. Using random and site-directed mutagenesis in combination with high-temperature activity screens, we successfully identify multiple point mutations that collectively increase the half-life of MMLV RT at elevated temperature. As we will show, the resulting pentuple mutant (MMLV RT M5) generates full-length cDNAs up to 55&#x000b0;C and shows great utility in the amplification of RNA targets with difficult secondary structures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>PicoMaxx&#x000ae; DNA polymerase (blend of Taq and Pfu), human total RNA (skeletal muscle, HeLa), Human Universal Reference total RNA, GeneMorph&#x000ae; II EZClone Domain Mutagenesis Kit, StrataPrep&#x000ae; Plasmid Miniprep kit, QuikChange&#x000ae; Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, QuikChange&#x000ae; Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, and BL21-CodonPlus&#x000ae; (DE3)-RIL competent cells were from Stratagene.

In combination, five of these mutations (E69K/E302R/W313F/L435G/N454K) broaden the thermal profile of MMLV RT (&#x0003e;85% activity between 40&#x000b0;C and 55&#x000b0;C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), and allow synthesis of long (9 kb) cDNAs up to 55&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Increased thermal resistance, however, is dependant on the presence of template-primer, as shown in both enzyme half-life and CD spectral analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn952/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link>).

However in the absence of substrate, wild-type and mutant enzymes are equally sensitive to temperature. Both enzymes start to unfold at the same temperature (transition temperature, 34&#x000b0;C) and are completely inactive within 5 min of heating at 55&#x000b0;C.</p><p>A discrepancy was observed between the activity and spectral profiles of MMLV RT, obtained in the presence of template-primer.

These results suggest that between 50&#x000b0;C and 60&#x000b0;C, small structural changes occur in the active site that interfere with nucleotide binding and ternary complex formation, but do not affect template-primer binding or global MMLV RT structure.</p><p>As template-primer is required, increased thermal resistance of M5 can be attributed to changes in enzyme&#x02013;substrate interactions, rather than to increased intrinsic stability. This conclusion is supported by steady-state kinetic measurements showing that the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> [RNA&#x02013;DNA] value of M5 is 10-fold lower than that of wild-type enzyme (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).

Three of the five mutations are located at positions that have been previously implicated in RT interactions with template-primer or in MMLV RT solubility.</p><p>The fingers domain of MMLV RT is thought to play a role in processive DNA synthesis by providing an intermediate binding site for template-primer between phosphonucleotidyl transfer reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In crystal structure of an N-terminal MMLV RT fragment (amino acids 24&#x02013;278; fingers-palm domains) bound to template-primer, side chains S67 (O<sup>&#x003b3;</sup>) and E69 (O<sup>&#x0025b;1</sup>) formed hydrogen bonds with the single-stranded template overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). However, when compared to the more recent structure of full-length MMLV RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), the fingers domain binding site was not accessible for DNA binding due to packing constraints. Increased thermal resistance exhibited by MMLV RT E69K is consistent with the proposal that E69 [which is conserved between MMLV and HIV RT; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>)] contributes to template-primer binding by providing a secondary binding site in the fingers domain. Moreover, saturation mutagenesis indicates that lysine is the only side chain substitution that provides increased thermal activity, suggesting that M5/template-primer interactions are stabilized through additional bond formation between the &#x0025b;-amino group of K69 and negatively charged phosphate groups on the RNA template strand.</p><p>The thumb of MMLV RT (amino acids 276&#x02013;361) is thought to play a role in substrate binding and processivity.

In a structure-based sequence alignment, MMLV RT E302 and T306 were identified as counterparts to HIV RT G262 and W266 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), which reside in helix &#x003b1;<sub>H</sub> facing the minor groove of the template-primer duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and interact with the primer strand sugar-phosphate backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Compared to wild-type, HIV RT G262A and W266A mutants exhibit lower processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and reduced template-primer binding affinity [14- and 4-fold higher <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> (RNA&#x02013;DNA) values, respectively; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>)], which is consistent with an assigned role in facilitating translocation of template-primer during polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>Increased thermal resistance exhibited by MMLV RT E302R/K, T306R/K, F309N and W313F mutants is consistent with the proposal that E302 and T306 are analogous to HIV RT G262 and W266 [despite differences in the structures of HIV RT &#x003b1;<sub>H</sub> and MMLV RT &#x003b1;<sub>J</sub>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>)], and that interactions with template-primer extend to F309 and W313. Failure to recover thermally resistant mutants by saturation mutagenesis of F303 and G305 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) suggests that these side chains face away from the surface (E302-T306-F309-W313) that interacts by analogy with HIV RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), with the minor groove of the template-primer duplex. Introducing positively charged (E302R/K, T306R/K) or polar (F309N) side chains may improve template-primer binding and thermal resistance by increasing the number of hydrogen bonds formed with minor groove base or phosphate backbone atoms. It is difficult to speculate as to how a relatively conservative hydrophobic mutation (W313F) enhances thermal activity. In a study of 129 protein&#x02013;DNA complexes, tryptophan was rarely found in DNA backbone or base interactions; in contrast, phenylalanine was frequently involved in van der Waals contacts with the sugar&#x02013;phosphate backbone or with DNA bases, positioned such that the plane of the ring faced DNA (no exposed bases) or was involved in ring-stacking interactions (exposed bases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>The connection domain (amino acids 362&#x02013;474) provides conformational flexibility between the RNA-/DNA-dependant polymerase and the C-terminal RNase H domain. The mutations that provide increased thermal activity in MMLV RT reside at the C-terminal end of &#x003b2;<sub>19</sub> (L435G/M) and in a large unstructured loop (N454K/R) that connects to the RNase H domain. L435 is a solvent-exposed residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), residing in a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids (432&#x02013;436: LVI<underline>L</underline>A) that were independently replaced by lysine in an effort to increase solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). L435K mutants exhibited increased solubility in the absence of detergents and near wild-type (&#x0223c;78%) levels of polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), indicating that this position is &#x02018;mutatable&#x02019; but not essential for function. In our screen for increased thermal resistance, we recovered L435M (random mutant library screen; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and L435G (saturation mutagenesis; 4/4 thermally active clones contained G; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) mutants, but not L435K, suggesting that local perturbations in &#x003b2;<sub>19</sub> (e.g. side chain loss, L435G; conservative replacement, L435M) can lead to changes in template-primer interactions. L435G/M mutations are not expected to confer thermostability through increased solubility or stability [as is the case for L435K; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>)], since M5 (contains L435G) shows the same heat-sensitivity and denaturation/aggregation behaviour as wild-type MMLV RT in the absence of template-primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn952/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link>). Residue N454, which is located distal to L435 in the connection domain, has not been previously implicated in template-primer interactions in MMLV RT.</p><p>In summary, we have engineered a pentuple mutant of MMLV RT (M5) that exhibits higher affinity for primed RNA and increased thermal activity in the presence template-primer. Compared to wild-type MMLV RT, M5 exhibits higher specific activity over a broad range of temperatures and improved synthesis of long cDNAs at elevated temperature (&#x0003e;50&#x000b0;C). As a result, M5 can serve as a single reagent for all cDNA synthesis systems, whether priming at 25&#x000b0;C with random hexamers, or at higher temperatures (55&#x000b0;C &#x02013;60&#x000b0;C) to enhance priming specificity or resolve secondary structures. A commercial preparation of MMLV RT, containing the five thermal resistance mutations identified here, is available for cDNA synthesis and RT&#x02013;PCR applications (AffinityScript RT).</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn952/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding for open access charge: Agilent Technologies, Stratagene Products Division, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
