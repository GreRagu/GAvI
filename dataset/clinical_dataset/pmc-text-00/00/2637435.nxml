However, the evolution of such robustness remains                    poorly understood for real genetic networks. Here we explore whether and how                    ploidy and recombination affect the evolution of robustness in a detailed                    computational model of the segment polarity network. We introduce a novel                    computational method that predicts the quantitative values of biochemical                    parameters from bit sequences representing genotype, allowing our model to                    bridge genotype to phenotype. Using this, we simulate 2,000 generations of                    evolution in a population of individuals under stabilizing and truncation                    selection, selecting for individuals that could sharpen the initial pattern of                    engrailed and wingless expression. Robustness was measured by simulating a                    mutation in the network and measuring the effect on the engrailed and wingless                    patterns; higher robustness corresponded to insensitivity of this pattern to                    perturbation. We compared robustness in diploid and haploid populations, with                    either asexual or sexual reproduction. In all cases, robustness increased, and                    the greatest increase was in diploid sexual populations; diploidy and sex                    synergized to evolve greater robustness than either acting alone. Diploidy                    conferred increased robustness by allowing most deleterious mutations to be                    rescued by a working allele. Sex (recombination) conferred a robustness                    advantage through &#x0201c;survival of the compatible&#x0201d;: those                    alleles that can work with a wide variety of genetically diverse partners                    persist, and this selects for robust alleles.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Most so-called &#x0201c;higher organisms&#x0201d; are diploid (have two                    copies of each gene) and reproduce sexually. Diploidy may be advantageous if one                    functional copy can mask the effects of a mutation in the other copy; however,                    it is a liability if most mutations are dominant. Sex can increase genetic                    diversity and the rate of evolution by creating new combinations of alleles that                    might function better together but can also disrupt working combinations. Given                    these trade-offs, why are sex and diploidy so common, and why do they occur so                    often together? We hypothesize that sex and diploidy allow gene networks to                    evolve to function more robustly in the face of genetic and environmental                    variation. This robustness would be advantageous because organisms are exposed                    to constantly changing environments and all genes undergo mutation. To test this                    hypothesis, we simulated evolution in a model of the segment polarity network, a                    well-studied group of genes essential for proper development in many organisms.                    We compared the robustness of haploid and diploid populations that reproduced                    either sexually or asexually. Sexually reproducing diploid populations evolved                    the greatest robustness, suggesting an explanation for the selective advantage                    of diploid sexual reproduction.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phenotypic robustness, also called canalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Waddington1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, is the ability of a                phenotype to persist when challenged by a perturbation to the system producing it.                Many phenotypes are not the product of an individual gene, but rather arise from                interactions within larger gene networks. The functions of several well-studied                networks have been shown or predicted to be robust to quantitative variation in the                biochemical kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Clodong1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. This variation can                come from both intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (environmental) sources: Genetic                diversity (polymorphism) within populations can produce variation in gene expression                levels and in the activity of gene products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Rockman1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Rahim1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In a                genetically diverse, sexually reproducing population, recombination is continuously                producing new combinations of alleles, and robustness to genetic variation would                confer a fitness advantage. This intuition is supported by experiments showing much                genetic variation is hidden&#x02014;i.e. quantitative variation between                individuals has no detectable effect on phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Gibson1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Another source of                perturbation is environmental: Individuals can transiently experience a broad range                of potentially noxious environments (due to pH, oxygen level, starvation conditions,                or temperature) that alter protein activity and potentially disrupt gene networks.                While only genetic effects are heritable, genetic and environmental variation both                perturb network dynamics, and robustness to one may confer robustness to the other                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Proulx1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Meiklejohn1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A possible mechanism to increase robustness is diploidy, as mutations can be masked                by a functional copy (a recessive mutation), allowing greater tolerance to mutation.                However, it is unclear whether diploidy is an advantage in genetic networks, because                it is also potentially harmful: a diploid network will have mutations twice as often                as a haploid, and a single bad allele could break the network (a dominant mutation).                Most deleterious mutations in enzyme coding genes are recessive to the wild type                alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Fisher1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wilkie1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

This theory was formulated for metabolic networks where                all gene products were enzymes, and it may not hold for gene regulatory networks                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Savageau1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Phadnis1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Experimental                evolution on yeast, which can exist either as haploids or diploids, has shown that                different ploidies are advantageous under different conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Zeyl1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Thompson1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

However,                this is an oversimplification because if most deleterious mutations are recessive,                the evolutionary advantage of diploidy remains questionable as the effects of rare                beneficial recessive mutations could likewise be masked.

However, it is                unknown whether these results hold for real networks because interactions between                mutations may be more complicated than theoretical studies assume. Additionally,                real networks may have subtle topological or regulatory architecture that differ                from randomly-wired model networks in important ways. Sex and diploidy are commonly                found together, and both may produce greater robustness, but this has not been                tested for gene regulatory networks.</p><p>In this study, we investigate how ploidy and sex (recombination) affect the evolution                of robustness in a detailed model of the segment polarity network. Previous modeling                studies focused on highly simplified and abstract networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Ancel1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Siegal1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, and it                is essential to test whether these findings hold in a realistic network with a known                function. The segment polarity network is a canonical example of a pattern forming                network that is robust to variation in its underlying biochemical kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. It                is essential for development in many insects, and the function of its genes and                their interactions within the network are well-understood. In this network, gene                expression is regulated at both pre- and post-transcriptional levels, with some                regulations requiring cell&#x02013;cell communication. During development prior to                the operation of the segment polarity network, gap and pair-rule genes activate                expression of wg and en in a noisy prepattern of stripes. The segment polarity                network in <italic>Drosophila</italic> development then sharpens and maintains these                stripes through the lifetime of the organism. Correct location of these stripes of                expression is essential for development, as they provide positional information to                activate downstream genes and processes in the proper locations. Previous work                showed that a haploid model reconstituting the known interactions within this                network can robustly reproduce the observed pattern of gene expression (i.e. the                phenotype) despite large changes in the model parameters representing the                biochemical kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Ingolia1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To investigate the evolution of phenotypic robustness of the segment polarity                network, we developed a novel approach where model parameters were calculated from a                digital genotype, allowing our model to bridge genotype to phenotype (the pattern of                gene expression) in a way that can capture the quantitative and qualitative effects                of mutation and recombination. Mutations can alter the strength of interactions, and                all connections/processes in the network can vary and evolve in a simulated                population of organisms. Additionally, we built a diploid model of this network,                which allows 2 versions of each gene and all resulting gene products to have                potentially different kinetics. Using these, we explore how and whether a diploid                model is more robust compared to the haploid. We simulate a population of                individuals (organisms endowed with the network), with selection only to stabilize                the correct spatiotemporal pattern of expression (phenotype). Using this more                biologically detailed representation of the segment polarity gene network we                compared evolution of robustness in 4 different populations: sexual haploid, asexual                haploid, sexual diploid, and asexual diploid. We find that diploid sexual networks                evolve the greatest robustness increase and the combination of the two produces                greater robustness than either alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Models</title><p>We took as a starting point a previous haploid model of the segment polarity network                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Meir2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

The number of regulatory interactions in the diploid network                        can be more than doubled because of the increased combinatorics in diploid                        networks.

Cells with low initial expression of wg and en must                        have even lower expression by 200 minutes of development, while the cells                        expressing initially high wg and en must maintain high expression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.g001"/></fig><p>In the following paragraphs, we describe extensions to this model that allow us to                simulate evolution of the segment polarity network in response to selection on the                pattern of en and wg expression (the phenotype). We present a diploid version of the                model that allows us to directly compare evolution and robustness in haploid and                diploid models. We also use a novel framework of deriving model parameter values                from a digital genotype, which allows mutations to alter many gene properties (i.e.                changes in expression level, stability and activity). Using these, we start with                initially viable identical founders and follow them through 2,000 generations of                evolution as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g002">Figure 2A</xref>.

A population of individuals is                        generated, and their genotype determines their phenotype. Individuals are                        subject to either truncation or stabilizing selection, and viable                        individuals mate (if sexual) or divide (if asexual). Each gene in the next                        generation has a small (3&#x00025;) chance of having a mutation. (B) Each                        model parameter was determined from genotype represented as a bit sequence.                        The model parameter value was calculated from the amount of complementarity                        between 2 different bit sequences with a length of 20 bits (figure shows 10                        bits for simplicity), representing the shapes of interacting surfaces in the                        biomolecules. Black and red lines are graphical representations of the                        shapes these bit sequences represent; 1's indicate protrusions,                        0's indicate crevices. Each bit is weighted double that to its                        right, and the strength of the interaction is scaled by the binary exclusive                        OR (XOR) between the two bit sequences. A perfect fit in a binding                        interaction would have a low dissociation constant, while worse fits would                        have corresponding looser binding. (C) Mutations may have specific effects                        depending on the location in the gene. Each gene had many separate bit                        sequences, one for each parameter in the model that the gene was involved                        in, corresponding to the different quantitative effects of mutation. For                        example, a mutation in the enhancer or promoter sequence (E/P) would alter                        gene expression levels, while mutations in the 5&#x02032; untranslated                        region or translation initiation site (UTR/SD) would alter translation                        rates. Mutations in the coding region that alter the binding site for CID on                        the PTC protein (Red) would alter the ability of PTC to cleave CID.                        Similarly, the different active sites on the CID protein (green, blue,                        orange) could be specifically altered by mutations in the coding region.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.g002"/></fig><sec id="s2a"><title>Model of the Haploid Segment Polarity Network</title><p>Mathematically, our model of the haploid segment polarity network is the same as                    described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> with 2                    modifications: (1) The equations incorporate parameters for transcriptional and                    translational synthesis rates (which were previously removed by                    nondimensionalization).

The system                    simulates a row (4 cells wide) of square cells with repeating (toroidal)                    boundary conditions to represent a 2-D sheet of interacting cells.

We constructed a diploid                    model of the network with 2 versions of each gene and gene product. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows the diploid                    network for only the <italic>ptc</italic> and <italic>cid</italic> genes; both                    the number of distinct biomolecules (boxed items) and the number of interactions                    (lines) can increase by a factor of 2 or more. In the diploid model, there are 2                    distinct versions of each mRNA and protein. However, for complexes, such as the                    Patched-Hedgehog dimer, there are 4 possible distinct dimers (4 ways to combine                    the 2 HH and 2 PTC proteins).</p><p>In the diploid network, all molecules maintain the same activities as in the                    haploid, but the presence of two alleles must be correctly implemented to follow                    the established biology of diploidy. Fluxes/conversions (solid lines in the                    network diagram) are doublings of the haploid version: translation, decay, exo                    &#x00026; endocyctosis, and diffusion. For example, each protein is translated                    only from the corresponding mRNA; i.e. CID1 protein is translated only from cid1                    mRNA, while CID2 protein is translated from cid2 mRNA (and we assume it is                    independent of cid1 translation). Similarly, the two versions of each                    biomolecule decay independently with 1<sup>st</sup> order kinetics (we assume                    the decay of one allele does not affect the rate of decay of its homologue).                    Regulatory interactions (dotted lines in the network) become more complex in the                    diploid network, as we must account for the combined regulatory activity of both                    alleles. In the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g001">Figure                        1B</xref>, each of the two CID proteins can have a potentially different                    effect on the activity of each of the ptc target genes, so the number of arrows                    (regulatory interactions) has quadrupled compared to the haploid case.</p><p>For diploid networks, we construct an extension of the Hill function to allow for                    two activators controlling expression of a target.

A highly realistic model would                    ideally track the bound state of each enhancer site for a gene (perhaps                    including current availability of the site based on histone acetylation, etc.),                    the affinity of each activator allele for each site, and the contribution of                    each bound transcription factor to the initiation of transcription. We settled                    upon the formulation in Equation 5 because it is simple (both to use and                    understand) but captures attractive features of diploidy. Specifically, our                    scheme: (1) Captures the same qualitative biological behavior as the Hill                    function did in the haploid case: saturation and monotonicity.

Depending on the activities of the two activator proteins A1 and A2,                    the loss of either could result in anything from an insignificant change (if                        <italic>A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic> were both far above their                    respective <italic>K</italic>'s) to a dramatic change (if                    <italic>A1</italic> and <italic>A2</italic> were near their respective                    <italic>K</italic>'s).</p><p>We emphasize that the segment polarity network has highly nonlinear behavior                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-vonDassow2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, and the loss of                    one allele in an otherwise homozygous individual will usually not result in a                    simple halving of expression in the affected gene. There is substantial feedback                    between different genes and different cells, and some perturbations can result                    in a complete change in the pattern of expression, while others will produce                    almost no change. Because there are multiple cells in the network that are                    co-regulating each other, many genes must be expressed within a correct window                    of expression (above one threshold but simultaneously below another) in each of                    the cells. Additionally, when there is high cooperativity in Equations 3 and 5,                    the resulting gene activity may be unchanged (if far from the threshold for                    activity) or completely lost (if near threshold).</p><p>Our implementation of diploidy does not allow for the possibility of interactions                    between the two activator alleles: for example that A1 and A2 compete for                    binding sites in such a way that A1 fails to activate production of X and also                    (dominantly) blocks the activity of A2 (by binding nonproductively to enhancer                    sites). Similarly, we do not allow for overdominance effects such as A1 and A2                    somehow synergizing so that their combination has greater activity than an                    equivalent amount of either alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Representing Genotype</title><p>The models of the segment polarity network described above are insufficient to                    predict the effects of mutations on phenotype because many parameters in the                    model are not properties of individual gene products, but instead reflect                        <italic>interactions</italic> between biomolecules. For example, many                    parameters in our model determine how well a transcription factor activates or                    inhibits its target's gene expression. In reality, the strength of such                    regulatory interactions could be altered by mutating either the transcription                    factor or enhancer sequence, resulting in different patterns of inheritance                    depending which gene combination is passed on to the offspring. Additionally, a                    single mutation can perturb multiple parameters in the model: a mutation in a                    transcription factor will affect its ability to recognize both enhancer                    sequences.</p><p>Biophysically, interactions in genetic networks rely on physical binding of                    biomolecules in regions with complementary surface chemistry and topology. To                    capture the qualitative behavior of such binding, we abstract genotype as a bit                    sequence (digital genotype) comprised of 1's &#x00026; 0's                    that can be imagined as a surrogate for the physical surface of molecules that                    participate in a binding interaction (i.e. an enzyme's active site or                    the binding surface offered by an enhancer consensus sequence) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. The                    strength/kinetics of an interaction (represented by biochemical parameters in                    our model) are determined by the degree of complementarity between two bit                    sequences, weighted by bit position. Each bit in the sequence is weighted twice                    that of its neighbor on the right to allow mutations that alter bit-sequences to                    have graded effects from very small to large (the motivation for this choice is                    further discussed in the section &#x0201c;simulating mutation&#x0201d;                    below). The parameter is derived from the interacting bit sequences by simply                    scaling the normalized bitwise XOR value of the bit sequences according to                    either a linear<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.e012.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>or logarithmic scaling:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.e013.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula><italic>bitSequenceA</italic> and <italic>bitSequenceB</italic>                    are the numeric representations of the binary interacting sequences and                        <italic>N</italic> is the length of the bit sequence, set to 20 for our                    simulations. We used linear scaling (Equation 6) for <italic>K</italic>                    parameters, and logarithmic scaling (Equation 7) for all others. Linear vs. log                    scaling was used so that mutations usually resulted in a weak/nonexistent                    interaction as described in the &#x0201c;simulating mutation&#x0201d;                    section below. Cooperativities were restricted to integer values by rounding the                    results of Equation 6 to the nearest integer in order to speed numerical                    integration.</p><p>Several parameters reflect the interaction of the segment polarity genes with                    genes products outside of the network. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000296.s002">Table S1</xref> lists the general categories of                    parameters in the model, what they represent, and indicates whether the                    parameter is derived from two different bit sequences (i.e. is an interaction                    between 2 genes with the segment polarity network) or is derived from the                    comparison of a bit sequence from a single gene with 0 (indicating interaction                    with general cellular machinery that we assume is constant). For example,                    maximal transcription and translation rates (<italic>C</italic> and                    <italic>L</italic> parameters) are determined by how well the SPN genes interact                    with the initiation machinery for these processes. Evolution of global cellular                    behavior is slow, while transcription factors evolve quickly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-CastilloDavis1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, therefore we did not allow global machinery to                    change, and held the corresponding bit sequences fixed at 0 (i.e. all                    0's in the bit sequence, this was chosen for convenience since again,                    this sequence did not evolve). This allows the maximum translation rates of                    genes to be changed and inherited as any other property, but does not allow, for                    example, heritable ribosomal mutations that would globally alter all translation                    rates.

The lifetime of the dimer is the average of the contribution                    of the ability of HH to be recognized by the degradation machinery (bit sequence                    fixed at 0) and the PTC part.</p><p>In the model, different parameters for each gene describe distinct                    sub-activities/properties such as mRNA stability, protein stability, protein                    activity, expression level, etc., as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g002">Figure 2C</xref>. In reality, the DNA sequences                    determining these different activities are usually spatially separated on the                    gene: enhancer sites (affecting transcription rate) are on the non-coding region                    usually away from the ribosomal recognition sequence (which affects translation                    rate) and likewise distant from the coding region of the active site (which                    affects protein activity). Thus, most point mutations alter only one or a few                    properties of the gene products: for example a mutation in the coding sequence                    for a real protein might alter the protein's activity and stability                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Tokuriki1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, but not its transcription rate. Additionally,                    mutations in a transcription factor can alter its interactions with a subset of                    targets while leaving other interactions unaffected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Inga1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. To capture this in                    our model, <italic>we use a separate bit sequence for each of a gene's                        parameters (sub-activities)</italic>. For example, we use separate bit                    sequences for the maximum transcription rate of a gene, the stability (mean                    lifetime) of the mRNA, maximum translation rate into protein, stability of the                    protein, and each of the protein's activities. Thus, though there are 5                    genes (10 in the diploid model), there are far more bit sequences (&#x0223c;71                    in the haploid model, 142 in the diploid) than genes. From these bit sequences,                    all model parameters (57 haploid, 140 diploid) are determined using Equations                    6&#x02013;8. The number of model parameters is more than half the number of                    bit sequences because several parameters are derived by comparing bit sequences                    describing properties of segment polarity genes with fixed cellular machinery                    (fixed at a value of 0, and not included in the bit sequence count). Thus,                    parameters that reflect interaction with cellular machinery are simply inherited                    (though they can still be mutated).</p><p>Equations 6 &#x00026; 7 capture important relationships between different                    parameters in the model. In a diploid organism, consider a mutation in a                    transcription factor that affects the surface of the transcription factor that                    binds the enhancer. Such a mutation will alter the ability of the transcription                    factor to recognize the enhancer sequences of both target alleles: in Equation                    4, a mutation that alters the ability of transcription factor A1 to bind to                    enhancer sites will alter both <italic>K<sub>A1X1</sub></italic> and                            <italic>K<sub>A1X2</sub></italic>. Conversely, a mutation in an enhancer                    sequence will alter the ability of both transcription factor alleles to regulate                    the mutated gene. In Equation 4, a mutation that alters the enhancer sequence of                    X1 will alter the ability of both transcription factors, A1 and A2, to recognize                    it and will alter both <italic>K<sub>A1X1</sub></italic> and                        <italic>K<sub>A2X1</sub></italic>. If bit sequence <italic>B<sub>A1                            transcription</sub></italic> represents the surface of A1 that binds to                    enhancers, <italic>B<sub>A2 transcription</sub></italic> represents the surface                    of A2 that binds to enhancers, <italic>B<sub>X1 enhancer</sub></italic> is the                    surface presented by gene X1 recognizable by transcription factors, and                            <italic>B<sub>X2 enhancer</sub></italic> is the surface presented by                    gene X2 to transcription factors, then we can calculate the relative strengths                    of the two transcription factors to activate each target gene using Equation 6:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.e015.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(9a)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.e016.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(9b)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.e017.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(9c)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.e018.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(9d)</label></disp-formula>All 4 <italic>K<sub>AX</sub></italic> parameters share a common                    range from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.e019.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.e020.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. A single mutated bit sequence can affect multiple parameters,                    as expected from the underlying biology, and our model properly captures the                    qualitative effects of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>                    mutations.</p><p>To reiterate, our scheme of calculating parameters from Equations 6&#x02013;8                    is attractive because: (1) It is conceptually consistent with the underlying                    biophysical mechanism of binding. The binding surfaces/active sites are                    specified either directly by the genotype (i.e. a regulatory consensus sequence)                    or indirectly (the genotype specifies the 3-D shape of a protein), but the                    ultimate origin of both is a mutable sequence (the DNA sequence of the gene).                    (2) It allows us to compute how well a gene product can interact with any                    partner, allowing us to easily simulate the effects of recombination (which will                    produce new combinations of alleles that may not have worked together before)                    and inheritance, as parameter values are interactions (not heritable) that                    depend on the interacting genes. Our scheme allows us to calculate the strength                    of an interaction when, for example, both a transcription factor and the                    enhancer sequence it binds are mutated. (3) It allows us to simulate both                        <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> mutations. Transcriptional                    regulation can be altered by a mutation in either the transcription factor or                    the enhancer, with different consequences depending on which is mutated. Our bit                    sequence representation allows this aspect of biological reality to be captured.                    (4) It allows us to capture the general qualitative features of mutations (see                    next section).

During evolution, we allow a much                    wider range of parameter values than during the search for founders, as                    mutations should often weaken (but rarely strengthen) an interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Simulating Mutation</title><p>We emphasize that the bit sequences described in the previous section are                    abstract surrogates for the 3-D physical surfaces of molecules that participate                    in an interaction. They do not attempt to represent base pairing between                    complementary nucleotide sequences as all interactions in the segment polarity                    network are protein&#x02013;protein or DNA/RNA-protein interactions. There is                    no general theory that allows us to calculate the strength of binding between an                    arbitrary gene product and its partners, nor to predict the effect of a general                    mutation on the strength of this binding. Quantitatively, a point mutation can                    have varied effects on an interaction: a complete quenching of an interaction                    (mutation of the nucleotide/amino acid that is essential for                    binding/interaction), an almost imperceptible change (mutation at a site                    peripheral to the key interaction that slightly perturbs the interaction                    strength), a (less likely) strengthening of the interaction (a mutation that                    slightly increases the affinity of binding). In general, most mutations lower                    the expression and activity of gene products, though rare mutations may                    strengthen them.</p><p>After each mating/division in our evolutionary simulation, we allow a                    3&#x00025; chance per gene of a mutation. In a mutated gene, we mutate a                    randomly-chosen bit sequence, with a recursive 10&#x00025; chance that an                    additional bit randomly-chosen bit sequence in the same gene is mutated. Thus,                    mutations typically change one bit sequence (90&#x00025; probability per                    mutation) or more than one (10&#x00025; probability per mutation) in the                    gene, allowing mutations to, for example, change both the activity and stability                    of a gene product. When a bit sequence is mutated, we randomize each position of                    the bit sequence to a 0 or 1 (mutations result in an independent random draw).                    The effect of this is the corresponding parameter(s) is/are set to a value                    between the min and max shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000296.s003">Table S2</xref>. For example, the mean lifetime for                    a gene product (<italic>H</italic> parameters) will have a log-distributed                    random value between 1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> and 100 after a                    mutation                        (mean&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>;                    a factor of 500 lower than the most unstable founder). Thus, 75&#x00025; of                    mutations will result in near to complete elimination of a gene product (with a                    mean lifetime less than 1; in the founders, mean lifetimes vary from                    5&#x02013;100). Only a fraction (&#x0223c;12&#x00025;) of mutations will                    produce protein stabilities comparable to those of the founders. Similarly,                    values for transcriptional regulation (half maximal concentrations or                    <italic>K</italic> parameters) will have a random value uniformly distributed                    between 0.001 and 100 (mean&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;50, a factor of                    100 higher than most founders and no gene product in any simulation evolved                    expression high enough to activate a process with such a weak interaction). This                    biases the parameter towards extremely high values (i.e. weak activity), with                    &#x0003e;99&#x00025; of mutations producing ineffective (or dramatically                    lowered) transcriptional regulation. For the special case of cooperativities                        (<italic>&#x003bd;</italic> parameters), we restricted these values to a                    narrow range (mutations produce integer cooperativities between 1 and 10), as                    high cooperativities are computationally expensive. Thus mutations usually                    produce a limited change in cooperativity, biased towards low cooperativity (log                    scaled). For all other parameters (&#x0003e;80&#x00025; of parameters),                    mutations, on average, produce interactions 2&#x0002b; orders of magnitude                    weaker than the founders.</p><p>In our model, mutations usually result in very weak or absent interactions (i.e.                    the corresponding parameter has a value so the interaction is silent). We have                    not attempted to reproduce the real distribution of mutational effects. Our                    model parameters abstract a wide variety of processes (RNA stabilities, protein                    stabilities, transfer/diffusion rates, etc.). For many processes, the mutational                    effects are not well known, and capturing the remaining known mutational spectra                    would require a separate mutational scheme (or genotype&#x02192;parameter                    mapping function or both) for each class of parameter. Our goal was to allow                    mutations to have graded effects that usually disrupt interactions but                    occasionally strengthen them, and also allow us to calculate the strength of                    interaction between arbitrary pairs of partners (that may not have co-existed                    within the same individual before). Additional limitations of our mutation                    scheme: (1) We do not allow the possibility of whole gene duplications or genes                    to evolve novel interactions that are absent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g001">Figure 1A</xref> (i.e. dimerization between en and                    wg or PTC degrading en). (2) We do not attempt to capture the relative rates or                    magnitudes of mutational effects: one could imagine that mutations may more                    frequently alter a protein's mean lifetime than the per-molecule                    maximal catalytic rate due to the differences in mutational target size.                    Similarly, the magnitude of mutational effects may differ: individual amino                    acids may contribute weakly to the overall protein stability while mutations in                    the active site may dramatically alter catalytic rate.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Simulating Mating and Recombination</title><p>In sexual populations, mating was random, with randomly chosen (with replacement)                    pairs of parents producing a single offspring. Recombination proceeded as                    follows: In diploid sexual populations, each parent would randomly pass on one                    of its two alleles for each gene to the offspring (we did not include the                    effects of genetic linkage in this study). In haploid sexual populations, the                    haploid offspring produced by mating two haploid parents would randomly inherit                    (with 50&#x00025; chance) one of the two parents' alleles for each                    gene. In both cases, all bit sequences corresponding to an inherited gene were                    passed on together, and we did not allow recombination within genes. Division in                    asexual populations was implemented by allowing a randomly chosen individual to                    produce a clonal offspring that had the same genotype as the parent. In all                    simulations (sexual and asexual), the genotype was subject to mutation as                    described above, and individuals reproduced until the specified number of viable                    offspring reached the population limit. Drift is present in our simulations, as                    an unlucky individual may stochastically not mate/produce any offspring, and                    individuals could mate with more than one partner in each generation.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Simulating Evolution</title><p>We began by screening many randomly generated haploid genotypes to find 40                    &#x0201c;founder&#x0201d; genotypes that sharpened the pattern of wg and en                    mRNA expression as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g001">Figure                        1C</xref>.

Forty diploid founder genotypes were constructed from the haploid                    founders by making them homozygous for the haploid alleles (again, diploids                    homozygous for all genes produce the identical phenotype as the haploid).

From the                    perspective of this function, mutations that produce insufficiently sharpened wg                    and en stripes are disastrous while those that result in an over sharpened                    pattern are viable. To explore the consequences of this, we simulated truncation                    selection where individuals are dead (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.e031.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>) if wg and en have expression levels outside of the expression                    thresholds shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g001">Figure                    1C</xref>, or take too long to stabilize their correct patterns. Otherwise,                    individuals are viable with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.e032.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>. In other words, as long as en and wg are sufficiently high in                    the correct cells (and sufficiently low in the rest), the developmental                    processes that depend on wg and en expression are unperturbed and the individual                    will be viable. These two criteria approximate two biologically plausible                    extremes, truncation selection penalizing insufficient sharpening of the pattern                    but allowing the pattern to change, while stabilizing selection penalizes any                    deviation from the founder pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Measurement of Robustness</title><p>We tested robustness to 3 types of perturbations that the real segment polarity                    network might be exposed to: (1) Perturbation of a single bit sequence in a                    single randomly chosen gene. This usually caused a dramatic change in one or two                    parameters, and is conceptually similar to a point mutation that produces a                    specific effect. (2) Perturbation of all parameters. We multiplied each                    parameter (after calculating it from genotype) by a randomly-chosen                    (log-sampled) value from 0.66 to 1.5, independently (i.e. all parameters were                    perturbed by a factor up to 1.5). Extreme environmental stress (pH change,                    temperature change, starvation, etc.) could alter the cellular environment so                    many parameters are substantially altered. (3) Perturbation of initial                    conditions.

A variety of sources                    (developmental noise, mutations in genes responsible for the en and wg                    prepattern, etc) could result in a perturbed prepattern.</p><p>We quantified robustness to these sources of variability and, for clarity, we                    will use the term &#x02018;survivorship&#x02019; when describing results                    from truncation selection and &#x02018;fitness&#x02019; for stabilizing                    selection.

Diploid populations continued to                    exhibit increased robustness compared to haploid populations, especially when                    combined with sexual reproduction. Comparing the terminal generations that share                    a common founder, diploid sexual populations evolved the greatest robustness at                    generation 2,000 in almost all (38/40 truncation; 39/40 stabilizing) tests of                    robustness to point mutations, most (32/40 truncation; 31/40 stabilizing) tests                    of robustness to all parameter perturbations, and a substantial fraction (19/40                    truncation; 18/40 stabilizing) of tests of robustness to initial conditions.

This is not built in; our                    network allows for the possibility of dominant deleterious mutations. Examples                    of possible dominant (and lethal) mutations that we observed during simulated                    evolution: (1) A sufficiently hyperactive WG protein (which is initially                    expressed at non-zero levels in all cells in our simulation) could disrupt the                    normal gene expression pattern through excessive global wg autoactivation or                    global en activation. (2) A mutation in the enhancer of cid that causes loss of                    inhibition by en would result in overexpression of CID that disrupts the wg and                    en patterns. In our simulations, mutations usually result in nonproductive                    interactions, so mutation (1) is far less likely than mutation (2); the former                    requires the (unlikely) mutation that produces strong autoactivation while the                    latter requires a (more frequent) loss-of-function.</p><p>There are two mechanisms that may contribute to the increased robustness in                    diploid populations: First, diploidy allows masking of a perturbed allele by its                    homologue (i.e. most mutations are recessive). Second, diploid populations may                    evolve increased robustness faster than their haploid counterparts through a                    mechanism independent of dominance. To separate these, we measured robustness in                    diploid populations by simulating symmetric mutations that perturb both versions                    of an allele by the same amount, so there is no unperturbed homologue to mask                    the perturbed allele. Symmetric point mutations altered the same bit sequence in                    both alleles of the perturbed gene by the same amount (both homologous bit                    sequences were altered by an XOR operation with the same random value). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g005">Figure 5D</xref> shows the results of                    symmetrically perturbed diploid populations compared to their singly-perturbed                    haploid counterparts. The robustness of the symmetrically perturbed diploid                    populations was very close to the haploids, and changed only slightly over time,                    indicating that the majority of mutations are recessive in our diploid model of                    the segment polarity network.</p><p>The ability of the network to mask the effects of mutation may itself be evolving                    (i.e. over time, the network evolves so that more mutations are recessive). Such                    evolution would manifest in diploid populations as an increase in robustness to                    (single) point mutation without an increase in robustness to symmetric point                    mutations. Our data indicates this is the case for diploid sexual populations,                    as the dramatic increase in robustness to point mutations over time is almost                    eliminated under symmetric mutation. Diploid asexuals show a far smaller                    increase, indicating that sex accelerates evolution of greater masking (i.e.                    greater dominance of functional alleles).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Diploid Sexual Populations Select Strongly for Compatible Alleles</title><p>Why does sex produce more robust populations? In our simulations, individuals                    have reduced fitness/survivorship if they fail to sharpen the correct en and wg                    patterns sufficiently. Fitness/survivorship can be reduced by two sources: a new                    mutation or, in sexual populations, recombination of alleles that do not                    function properly together. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g006">Figure                        6</xref> shows the relative effect of recombination and mutation on                    survival. During the simulation, we recorded the number of dead individuals and                    their genotypes, and whether they had a new mutation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g006">Figure 6A</xref> shows the fraction of individuals                    with a new mutation that were viable.

To                    determine how often recombination produced incompatible allele combinations, we                    measured the fraction of deaths where individuals did not have a new mutation                    (i.e. the fraction of the dead due to recombination). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g006">Figure 6B</xref> shows diploid sexual populations                    showed a near doubling of this fraction compared to the haploid sexual                    populations. Thus, diploid sexual populations experience a greater pressure to                    maintain alleles that both produce the correct phenotype and that are also                    highly compatible with the other alleles in the population. Recombination                    constantly produces new allele combinations that cause quantitative variation;                    thus sexual populations (especially diploid sexual populations) more strongly                    select for genotypes (and alleles) that are robust to quantitative variation.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000296-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000296.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Distinguishing effects of mutation from recombination.</title><p>(A) Fraction of mutated individuals that were viable during evolutionary                            simulation.

Under both selection types, populations                    evolved to sharpen wg more rapidly, with all populations showing similar                    speeding. In contrast, sexual populations maintained the time to sharpening of                    the en pattern, but asexual populations (particularly diploid asexual) showed                    slowed sharpening. Thus, evolution did not exclusively favor faster sharpening.                    Under truncation selection, the expression levels at which both wg and en                    stabilized (in the different cells that should express those genes highly)                    evolved to higher and higher values.

Previous theoretical and modeling studies                have predicted mutational robustness can evolve, but we believe it is essential to                test these findings in as detailed a model as possible. Our model allows us to                bridge genotype to phenotype and to capture fundamentally important aspects of                allelic fitness which no previous model has represented. We found that diploidy and                sex combine to allow populations to evolve the greatest robustness to mutation,                global perturbations affecting all interactions, and initial conditions. Diploidy                confers an immediate robustness advantage as most deleterious mutations are                recessive in our network, and over time the network evolves so that functional                alleles become more dominant. Recombination, especially in diploid populations,                produced a greater fitness load that selected for greater robustness evolution even                at lower mutation rates of &#x003bc;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1/N.                Recombination in our network constantly shuffled alleles and prevented the                stabilization of matched allele combinations that could be maintained in asexual                populations. In sexual populations, the constant shuffling of alleles by                recombination in a genetically diverse population selects for those alleles that are                highly compatible with others&#x02014;i.e. alleles that are robust to genetic                variation and mutation.</p><p>It is useful to compare our evolutionary model to that of previous computational                studies on robustness evolution.

The Wagner model                assumes a fixed time step, steep nonlinearities that result in effectively discrete                expression levels and additive regulatory effects. All parameters reflect the                strength of transcriptional activation/repression and mutation allows single                mutations to change an inhibitor to an activator with 50&#x00025; probability. In                contrast to this, our model allows continuously variable expression levels with more                graded nonlinearities (the maximum Hill coefficient in our simulations was 10).                Previous models with fixed time steps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Siegal1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> reported a dramatic                increase in speed in generating the target pattern of gene expression, while we                observed only a slight speeding of wg (but not en) sharpening. In our model,                molecular half lives can be mutationally altered as they would be in real life,                which is difficult to translate to a fixed-time step model. It also permits                non-additive interactions between multiple transcriptional regulators. Our model                does not allow the sign of a regulatory interaction to change (inhibitors never                switch to activators), and allows mutations to be <italic>cis</italic> or                    <italic>trans</italic> (the Wagner model parameters represent                <italic>cis</italic> effects only <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>), thus allowing a meaningful exploration of                diploidy.

These models allow the                detailed quantitative prediction of effects of mutation which we cannot do for our                model; additionally it is difficult to explore the effects of recombination and                diploidy in these models in a way that would meaningfully translate to genetic                regulatory networks. It would be possible to alter our model so that the bit                sequences represented mutable DNA/RNA sequences from which the interaction strength                is calculated. We did not explore this because we wanted a general scheme to capture                interactions within the network, and most model parameters reflect protein-protein                or protein-DNA interactions. If we replaced our binary bit sequences with sequences                of DNA bases (ATGC) or the 20 amino acids, there is no tractable function to                describe how well the two would interact, as such a calculation would require                prediction of the tertiary or quaternary structure. For the case of protein-DNA                interactions with known binding motifs, the effects of mutations can be approximated                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Benos1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Benos2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, and it would be an interesting extension to this                work to incorporate a similar approximation. However, there are many interactions in                addition to transcriptional regulation in our model, and such a scheme would not                allow us to model all parameters. One final limitation of computer simulation is                that we are limited by available computing power to relatively small populations and                high mutation rates. Real <italic>Drosophila</italic> effective population sizes and                mutation rates differ from our simulations by more than an order of magnitude.                    <italic>Drosophila</italic> populations are monomorphic for most genes                (N&#x003bc;&#x0003c;1), so robustness is unlikely to evolve through the mechanism in                our model. The small population size we use strongly increases the effect of drift,                and may lead to increased genetic load and heterozygosity compared to                larger/infinite populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Haag1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.

More generally, Proulx and Phillips<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Proulx1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> predict that selection for robustness depends on                the fitness load (effect of variation from all sources), and we clearly see diploid                sexual populations have the greatest load (from mutation and recombination), while                sex has little effect on haploid populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g009">9</xref>).

The most likely explanation for this                decrease is because the diploid founders are homozygous for all alleles, and thus                both &#x02018;halves&#x02019; of the network are identical.

Because there is only a single                working allele, there is nothing to rescue this network when that allele is mutated,                resulting in a decrease in robustness compared to the founder. The decrease in                robustness does not continue forever, reaching a minimum by approximately generation                1,000. The initial decrease in robustness reflects the loss of functionally                redundant alleles possessed by the founders, consistent with theory that suggests                selection to maintain both alleles is weak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Nowak1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We found diploidy confers a robustness advantage primarily because most deleterious                mutations are recessive to their working counterparts.

This is consistent with metabolic                networks, however, we do not allow for the possibility of interference between two                alleles (i.e. that wg1 might bind nonproductively to its targets, blocking wg2                activity as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g003">Figure 3</xref>                and discussed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Models</xref> section).

Since the segment polarity network stabilizes stripes of gene expression that                activate downstream processes at the proper location, fitness must depend on the                pattern produced. Our truncation selection explores the simple assumption that the                expression of a segment polarity gene must be above a threshold for activation of                those processes in the correct location and below this threshold everywhere else,                for development to proceed normally.

Our simulations show truncation                selection leads to evolution of higher gene expression (far above threshold) in                those cells that should express the gene. Intuitively, very high gene expression                levels should buffer the system to tolerate perturbations that cause slight changes                in expression level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Haldane1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, and our simulations are consistent with this                intuition and previous modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Siegal2">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. We do not impose a cost associated with higher                expression, though presumably greater synthesis comes with a metabolic cost that                would eventually limit the expression. The ultimate level of expression depends upon                on the balance of synthesis and degradation, and mutations that solely increase the                stability of a gene product likely have little metabolic cost, but it is difficult                to determine the upper limit for gene product stability. Thus, in truncation                selection, our founders had non-optimal patterns of gene expression that satisfied                the developmental task; and evolved towards a more optimal phenotype with high                expression levels of essential genes. However, the increase in expression alone                shows only a weak correlation with increased robustness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000296-g008">Figure 8</xref>), and robustness in both truncation and                stabilizing selection shows similar increases despite an unchanging pattern under                stabilizing selection. Many parameters in our model reflect the activity of a gene                product (<italic>K</italic> parameters) and so gene activity can change without                changes in expression. It is likely that the absolute expression level is less                important than the amount by which the expression exceeds the minimum/maximum                threshold for activity. Thus, populations rapidly produce increased robustness                regardless of whether the initial phenotype is optimal, and can evolve increased                robustness without dramatic changes in phenotype.</p><p>Several extensions of this work warrant future study.

The topology of                the segment polarity network to robustly stabilize stripes of wg and en expression                may be nearly optimal, as indicated by a search of nearby network topologies in a                simplified network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Ma1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. It would be interesting to extend our                simulations to allow the topology to change (i.e. the rise of new regulatory                interactions) and gene duplication events, to see whether this topology is                evolutionarily preserved or, if evolution settles on an alternate network. Gene                duplication events would be particularly interesting because a duplication of all                genes in the network would effectively increase the ploidy. Many organisms exist as                tetraploid, octaploid or beyond, and others can amplify their genomic content                through endoreplication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Edgar1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref> to attain very high ploidy(&#x0003e;1000C).                Additionally, some viruses can have high effective ploidy when multiple viruses                infect the same cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Elena1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study suggests that having 2 copies of each                gene can confer a robustness advantage over just one because most mutations are                recessive and this more than compensates for the doubling of mutation rate. It would                be interesting to explore under what conditions an increase in ploidy ceases to be                advantageous in real networks, and why diploidy, as opposed to tetraploidy or beyond                is so common. Finally, our scheme for translating genotype to model parameters would                easily extend to randomly-wired networks used in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, and                allow diploid networks to be explored.</p><p>It is an open question as to how general our results are for other real networks.                Theory and modeling studies indicated that increased phenotypic robustness readily                evolves under conditions of interacting genes and variation in haploid networks                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Wagner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Lynch1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Azevedo1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000296-Siegal1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these studies and ours, we speculate                diploid sexual populations will evolve greater mutational robustness in networks                when most deleterious mutations are recessive, and there is sufficient interaction                between gene products so that recombination will select for alleles that can combine                robustly with other alleles. By allowing both masking (by diploidy) and allele                shuffling (recombination), the two can combine to achieve greater robustness than                either alone. Thus, a sexual population for which robustness is important would                likely favor a dominant diploid, not haploid, life cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1000296.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>List of equations in the model</p><p>(0.20 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1000296.s002"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Relation between genotype and parameter values in model</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1000296.s003"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Detailed listing of all parameters in haploid model and range explored for                        random search for founders and during evolutionary simulation</p><p>(0.10 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1000296.s003.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Garrett Odell, George von Dassow, Edwin Munro, Marie-Anne Felix, Victoria                Foe, Howard Clarke, and Erika Hoyos for helpful discussions and comments on the                manuscript.
