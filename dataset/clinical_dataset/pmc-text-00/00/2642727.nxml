Consequently, signatures are being incorporated into clinical practice and will soon influence everyday decisions in oncology. However, the slight overlap in the gene identity between signatures for the same cancer type or condition raises questions about their biological and clinical implications. To clarify these issues, better understanding of the molecular properties and possible interactions underlying apparently dissimilar signatures is needed. Here, we evaluated whether the signatures of 24 independent studies are related at the genome, transcriptome or proteome levels. Significant associations were consistently observed across these molecular layers, which suggest the existence of a common cancer cell phenotype. Convergence on cell proliferation and death supports the pivotal involvement of these processes in prognosis, metastasis and treatment response. In addition, functional and molecular associations were identified with the immune response in different cancer types and conditions that complement the contribution of cell proliferation and death. Examination of additional, independent, cancer datasets corroborated our observations. This study proposes a comprehensive strategy for interpreting cancer signatures that reveals common design principles and systems-level properties.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent years have seen the description of a large number of gene expression profiles or signatures with clinical value for the accurate prognostic or predictive characterization of cancer patients or tumors. Breast cancer is probably the paradigm of such studies, with at least three different signatures currently being tested in clinical trials and commercially available for routine clinical practice in oncology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Nuyten1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Morris1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the lack of overlap in the selected genes has raised fundamental questions about their biological and clinical implications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Michiels1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Eden1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This situation is not unique to breast cancer prognosis, and the description of new expression profiles suggests that it is common to other cancer types or conditions&#x02015;i.e. metastases and treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Lin1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Reasons to this paradox may be methodological disparities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Sherlock1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and statistical constraints created by the large number of genes examined with respect to the relatively small number of samples profiled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Son1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Roepman1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, a recent study by Perou and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Fan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> established the common prognostic value of some breast cancer signatures, despite the lack of overlap in gene identities. This observation confirmed the clinical relevance of the signatures and suggested that they may efficiently capture a common tumor cell phenotype(s) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Massague1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. This putative common phenotype for breast cancer and for other neoplasias must be defined if we are to better understand the significance of signatures.</p><p>Some of the early descriptions of signatures noted the presence of specific biological processes over-represented in the corresponding gene lists. Among these processes, individual genes involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis were highlighted (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-vantVeer1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Perou1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>). More recent evidence points to specific genes that are globally associated with breast cancer prognosis and related to cell proliferation among other processes or pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Chang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Shen2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is still unclear how this evidence characterizes different molecular levels and how the levels integrate into a systems-level model containing gene and/or protein interactions for breast cancer and for human cancer in general. Here, we used an integrative approach to determine the existence of a putative common tumor cell phenotype(s) associated with different cancer types and conditions. The study identified common molecular properties and network interactions associated with cell proliferation and death, and revealed associations with the immune response. Our results highlight the importance of studying signatures from a systems-level perpective.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Genomic properties: E2Fs and the estrogen receptor (ER)</title><p>To identify common properties among cancer signatures we compiled the literature gene lists from 24 studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004544.s002">Table S1</xref>). These represent 19 prognostic signatures, two signatures focused mainly on metastasis, and seven predictive treatment response signatures. All signatures used corresponded to validated sets of genes at the same level. We first examined the molecular properties or network topology characteristics of genes and/or proteins in these signatures at the genome, transcriptome and proteome levels. Next, the identified properties and network associations were corroborated in independent expression datasets of different cancer types and conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004544-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004544-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004544.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Integrative analysis of cancer signatures.</title><p>Strategy for defining the common properties and interactions between signatures at the genome, transcriptome and proteome levels, and validation in independent datasets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004544.g001"/></fig><p>Properties at the genome level were evaluated by probing the relative enrichment in predicted transcription factor binding site motifs at the promoters of signature genes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).

Convergence is defined by significant molecular and functional associations between genes and/or proteins: i/ predicted promoter motifs; ii/ experimentally identified DNA binding sites; iii/ cell cycle-periodic profiles; iv/ ER-mediated transcriptional regulation; v/ co-expression with defined transcription factors; vi/ co-expression between signatures and with specific GO gene sets; and, vii/ close proximity in the interactome network and neighborhood over-representation in these same GO terms. Consequently, this study suggests the existence of common design principles in a system-level cellular model&#x02014;illustrated by transcriptome-interactome correlations&#x02014;not only of prognostic signatures but also of metastasis and treatment response signatures. Overall, the integrative study highlights the importance of analyzing signatures beyond gene names, which provides a better global understanding by revealing previously unidentified properties and associations.</p><p>Biological convergence has important implications for the interpretation of signatures. Given a single gene whose transcript levels are associated with differences in patient outcome, this observation should be interpreted <italic>a priori</italic> in the context of cell proliferation, death or the immune response processes. For example, <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> have different cellular functions, with a degree of overlap, but each of them is present in several prognostic and predictive signatures, probably because their transcript levels reproduce precisely the potential for cell proliferation. This potential is defined by the presence of genes with periodic expression through the cell cycle, and other analyses at the genome, transcriptome and proteome levels shown here provide strong evidence of common properties and interactions. Therefore, further conclusions concerning gene functions such as DNA repair and its role in prognosis should be considered, controlling for the possible confounding effect of biological convergence.</p><p>From a mechanistic point of view, this study indicates the existence of a cancer cell phenotype that decisively influences critical aspects of neoplasia. This observation follows on from the long-known global importance of the potential for cell proliferation and repressed cell death in tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Hanahan1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, while reinforcing the emerging role of the immune response in prognosis and prediction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004544-Ambs1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. However, while this study provides the first evidence of convergence of prognostic, metastasis and predictive signatures in these processes, other processes or signaling pathways are probably represented and specificities may exist. For instance, the potential for metastasis also depends on the activity of processes such as extracellular matrix remodeling. Similar systems-level analyses of a larger number of metastasis signatures may reveal properties masked here by the restriction of the study to mainly prognostic and predictive sets.
