US28 binding to CC-chemokines is both necessary and sufficient to induce vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration in response to HCMV infection. However, the function of Fractalkine binding to US28 is unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that Fractalkine binding to US28 not only induces migration of macrophages but also acts to inhibit RANTES-mediated SMC migration. Similarly, RANTES inhibits Fractalkine-mediated US28 migration in macrophages. While US28 binding of both RANTES and Fractalkine activate FAK and ERK-1/2, RANTES signals through G&#x003b1;12 and Fractalkine through G&#x003b1;q. These findings represent the first example of differential chemotactic signaling via a multiple chemokine family binding receptor that results in migration of two different cell types. Additionally, the demonstration that US28-mediated chemotaxis is both ligand-specific and cell type&#x02013;specific has important implications in the role of US28 in HCMV pathogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Chemokines are small cytokines that are critical for recruiting and activating the cells of the immune system during viral infections. A number of viruses, including the large herpes virus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), encode mechanisms to impede the effects of chemokines or have gained the ability to use these molecules to their own advantage. HCMV encodes multiple chemokine receptors including US28, which binds two different classes of chemokines namely the CC and CX<sub>3</sub>C families. In this report, we demonstrate that US28 binding to a CC chemokine elicits different responses compared to when binding to Fractalkine, the only CX<sub>3</sub>C chemokine. RANTES (CC chemokine) binding to US28 mediates smooth muscle cell migration, but Fractalkine blocks this process in a dose-dependent manner. However, Fractalkine binding to US28 can specifically mediate the migration of macrophages, another important cell type during viral pathogenesis. We explored the intracellular signaling pathways responsible for each migration event and determined that they differ in the G-proteins that are coupled to US28 following addition of ligand and that this occurs in a cell type&#x02013;specific manner. These results provide a new mechanism for HCMV acceleration of vascular disease via the specific migration of macrophages and provide the first example of cell type&#x02013;specific migration via multiple chemokines binding to a single receptor.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>All &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;-herpesviruses encode molecules with the potential to modulate the host immune response, including chemokines and/or chemokine receptor homologs. The &#x003b2;-herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes a CXC-chemokine (UL146), a potential CC-chemokine (UL128), and four potential chemokine receptors (US27, US28, UL33 and UL78) with the most characterized being US28 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Akter1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Chee2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Chemokines are small, inducible cytokines that have critical roles in the induction and promotion of cellular migration and activation upon binding 7-transmembrane spanning G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). There are four major chemokine subfamilies that are categorized according to the spacing of the first two conserved amino-terminal cysteine residues: CC-, CXC-, CX<sub>3</sub>C- and XC-. Most chemokine receptors bind a limited subset of ligands belonging to a single subfamily. The ability to bind multiple ligands from different chemokine subfamilies is unique to a select few receptors including the Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokine (DARC-receptor) and the HHV-8-encoded chemokine receptor Orf74. These receptors have been reported to bind to both CC- and CXC-chemokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Szabo1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Lentsch1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. US28 also binds multiple ligands from different subfamilies. US28 contains homology to CC-chemokine receptors, with greatest homology to CCR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Gao1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and binds to a broad spectrum of CC-chemokines with high affinity including: RANTES, MCP-1, MIP-1&#x003b1; and MIP-1&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Kuhn1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, US28 also binds the CX<sub>3</sub>C-chemokine Fractalkine and with greater affinity than CC-chemokines. Although the N-terminal 22 amino acids of US28 have been shown to be required for binding of both chemokine classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Casarosa1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, binding is not competed with saturating quantities of selected CC-chemokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Kledal1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, Fractalkine is predicted to bind unique regions of US28 compared to the CC-chemokines. Indeed, recent mutagenesis studies of the US28 N-terminus revealed that the phenylalanine residue at position 14 of US28 is important for binding of CC chemokines but is dispensable for Fractalkine binding, while mutation of tyrosine 16 negatively effects binding of both classes of chemokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Casarosa2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Binding of chemokines to their respective receptors stimulates the cell type-dependent activation of a plethora of cellular signaling pathways specific to the chemokine/receptor pair. The CC-chemokines are known to be potent stimulators of cellular activation through US28. For example, in 293 cells, RANTES binding to US28 activates ERK-1/2 pathways through the G-proteins G&#x003b1;i1 and G&#x003b1;16 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Billstrom1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

We demonstrate that Fractalkine binding to US28 inhibits the ability of CC-chemokines to induce SMC migration. RANTES, MCP-1, and Fractalkine binding to US28 induced similar levels of FAK activation in fibroblasts. Overexpression studies indicate that RANTES-mediated stimulation of FAK occurs via a G&#x003b1;12-dependent mechanism while Fractalkine utlilzes G&#x003b1;q. In contrast to SMC, when US28 is expressed in macrophages, Fractalkine stimulation produces robust migration These results suggest that US28-signaling is ligand-specific and cell type-specific, and that RANTES and Fractalkine promote differential G-protein coupling leading to the activation of alternative signaling pathways depending on the cell-type and the complement of endogenously expressed G-proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ligand-Specific US28 Mediated Smooth Muscle Cell Migration</title><p>The unique ability of US28 to bind both CC- and CX<sub>3</sub>C-chemokine ligands raises the question of whether US28 signaling is not only ligand-dependent, but also ligand-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Kuhn1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Billstrom1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Bodaghi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Schall1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine whether US28 signaling and SMC migration are ligand-specific, we performed SMC migration and signaling assays on US28 adenovirus expressing primary rat SMC in the presence of RANTES or Fractalkine. In this assay, RANTES readily induced US28-mediated SMC migration, however, increasing concentrations of Fractalkine failed to stimulate cellular motility above Ad-tet-transactivator (Trans) infected and RANTES stimulated controls, indicating that not all US28 ligands evoke the same functional response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000304-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Visual analysis of the cells prior to and following the migration assay indicated that the lack of migration was not due to overt cell death mediated by US28 expression and subsequent treatment with Fractalkine (data not shown). A competition assay was performed to determine whether Fractalkine inhibits the ability of RANTES to induce SMC migration. In these experiments, RANTES alone promoted SMC migration, as expected. However, Fractalkine, at concentrations as low as 10ng/ml, was sufficient to block RANTES-mediated SMC migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000304-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) suggesting that Fractalkine is a competitive inhibitor to CC-chemokine induced SMC migration.</p><fig id="ppat-1000304-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000304.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Fractalkine inhibits US28-mediated SMC migration induced by RANTES.</title><p>(A) SMC migration assays were performed on cells infected with adenovirus expressing US28-HA treated with either RANTES or Fractalkine at the indicated concentrations.

To determine whether there exists a gross difference in the ability of these chemokine receptors/ligands to modulate intracellular signaling cascades, host transcriptional profiles were examined using DNA microarrays. Interestingly, the cellular gene expression profile of US28-expressing SMC stimulated with RANTES substantially differs from the profile obtained upon stimulation with Fractalkine. In fact, most of the genes that were up-regulated upon RANTES stimulation were down-regulated by Fractalkine. Specifically, RANTES binding to US28 induced expression of a number of cellular genes involved in cellular migration, while Fractalkine down-regulated many of these same genes (data not shown). These findings indicate that there are ligand-specific differences in US28 signaling that parallel the ability of either RANTES or Fractalkine to promote SMC migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ligand-Specific Signaling Mediated by US28</title><p>To determine if the different phenotypic outcomes of RANTES or Fractalkine binding to US28 is reflected in differences at the level of signal transduction, we examined the ability each class of chemokine ligand to activate FAK through binding to US28.

Reconstituted FAK&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells infected with adenoviruses expressing US28 and wild-type G&#x003b1;12 were stimulated with either RANTES or Fractalkine.

We attempted these experiments in human monocytes in the context of HCMV infection. However, the presence of endogenous chemokine receptors (including RANTES-binding CCR1 and CCR5 as well as the human fractalkine receptor CX<sub>3</sub>CR1) and endogenous chemokine ligands in these cells made the experimental results difficult to interpret. To compensate for technical difficulties, US28 was expressed from an adenoviral vector in the context of a rat macrophage cell line. We reasoned that compared to ligands produced in human monocytes fewer endogenous rat chemokines would functionally interact with US28 and, similarly, fewer endogenously expressed rat chemokine receptors would signal productively in response to stimulation with recombinant human chemokines.</p><p>Using a low temperature, low volume infection protocol, rat macrophages were infected with adenovirus expressing US28 at various MOI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000304-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

In these assays, Fractalkine induced robust migration of US28-expressing macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000304-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Statistically significant migration was seen at very low (1ng/ml) concentrations of chemokine but not in control cells expressing only Trans.

While RANTES stimulation of US28 causes robust SMC migration, Fractalkine provides an anti-migratory signal in these cells. Similarly, RANTES but not Fractalkine increases transcription of genes involved in SMC migration. In contrast, Fractalkine but not RANTES provides a strong chemotactic stimulus for US28-expressing macrophages, and RANTES is able to competitively inhibit Fractalkine-mediated macrophage migration. Interestingly, while these ligands display differential signaling characteristics with respect to cellular migration, they both are capable of activating FAK and producing actin cytoskeletal rearrangements in fibroblasts. Importantly, we demonstrate that these phenotypic differences can be attributed to RANTES and Fractalkine causing differential G-protein coupling to US28. Fractalkine induced-US28 signaling occurs in a G&#x003b1;q-dependent manner and is abrogated in the presence of G&#x003b1;12 but not by PTX. However, RANTES induced migration and signal transduction occurrs in a G&#x003b1;12 dependent manner and is blocked by overexpression of G&#x003b1;q. Ultimately, our findings indicate that US28 binding to RANTES or Fractalkine results in differential G-protein coupling/activation leading to unique functional consequences.</p><p>While most chemokine receptors bind a limited subset of chemokines from a single chemokine subfamily, there are three examples of chemokine receptors that bind chemokines from multiple subfamilies: the DARC-receptor, Orf74 of HHV-8, and US28 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Szabo1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Lentsch1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Kledal1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. To date DARC, which binds both CC- and CXC-chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, and CXCL8), is the only true chemokine sink because this receptor binds and internalizes these ligands without inducing signaling events. Orf74 has also been demonstrated to bind both CC- and CXC-chemokines; however, there is a significant difference in the affinity of individual ligands for this receptor. Despite being referred to as an IL-8 receptor, Orf74 has greater affinity for GRO peptides (&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;) than for IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Rosenkilde1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In competition binding assays with IL-8, Orf74 binding to the CC-chemokines MIP-1&#x003b1;, MIP-1&#x003b2;, MCP-1, and RANTES was virtually undetectable, while MCP-3 and aminooxypentane (AOP)-RANTES display affinities in the 200nm range. Interestingly, the structurally distinct, non-ELR containing CXC-chemokines IP-10 and SDF-1&#x003b1; can displace IL-8 binding, and function as efficient inverse agonists of Orf74 signaling at nanomolar concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Rosenkilde1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Although Orf74 binds to chemokines from multiple chemokine subfamilies, Orf74 signaling only occurs in the presence of ELR, and pro-inflammatory/angiogenic chemokines, whereas the angiostatic non-ELR CXC-chemokines function as efficient inverse agonists.

In accordance with these ligand-specific functional responses, microarray analysis of US28-expressing SMC stimulated with either RANTES or Fractalkine revealed profound differences at the level of gene induction. In the context of CMV-infection of SMC, the ability of US28 to adhere to mobilized Fractalkine, coupled with our finding that this chemokine reverses transcriptional activation required for cellular migration in SMC, suggests that Fractalkine may arrest US28-induced SMC migration and promote the subsequent adhesion of US28 expressing SMC to the vascular endothelium. The migration of HCMV infected and US28 expressing SMC from the vessel media to inflammatory sites in the vessel intima and the subsequent adhesion and accumulation of SMC in the vessel intima may have important implications in the dissemination and <italic>in vivo</italic> pathogenesis of HCMV, as well as in the exacerbation of vascular disease.</p><p>In this study, we also demonstrate that Fractalkine causes robust migration of US28-expressing macrophages, which is the first known cellular phenotype associated with Fractalkine binding to US28.

Our current findings suggest a secondary mechanism for US28 in CMV-mediated vascular pathology by which circulating CMV-positive monocytes infiltrate atherosclerotic plaques mediated by Fractalkine binding to US28.</p><p>We demonstrate for the first time that Fractalkine is a potent agonist capable of inducing cellular migration in macrophages and activation of signaling pathways upon binding US28. Prior to this study, Fractalkine had been employed as a modulator of US28-mediated constitutive signaling activity. Some of the signaling pathways activated by Fractalkine were similar to those activated by the CC-chemokines. For example, RANTES, MCP-1, and Fractalkine all display similar abilities to induce ERK-1/2, actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and formation FAK-Grb2 complexes in fibroblasts. Pre-treatment with PTX enhanced Fractalkine mediated FAK activation through US28, which indicated that Fractalkine promoted US28 coupling to G-proteins other than Gai/o. Expression of G&#x003b1;12 delayed and reduced FAK activity via Fractalkine signaling through US28 but had no effect on RANTES/US28 activation of FAK. Importantly, overexpression of G&#x003b1;q blocked RANTES signaling to FAK but had no effect on Fractalkine-mediated FAK activation. In a number of different activation scenarios FAK is a known point of signaling convergence and has been demonstrated to be phosphorylated in response to G&#x003b1;q/11, G&#x003b1;i/o, and G&#x003b1;12/13 coupled receptors in various cell types and signaling environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Morishita1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Chikumi1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In one study, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling stimulated both membrane association and autophosphorylation of FAK but these two effects were separable and mediated by different G-alpha subunits (G&#x003b1;i1 and G&#x003b1;12/13, respectively) presumably via signaling from two different LPA receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Bian1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, in a receptor-decoupled system of constitutively active G-alpha subunits, significant FAK phosphorylation can be observed via signaling through G&#x003b1;q, G&#x003b1;12 and G&#x003b1;13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Chikumi1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. These results are consistent with our observations that both RANTES and Fractalkine binding to US28 can activate FAK via different signaling cascades mediated by different G-proteins. Our results suggest that overexpression of off-target G-proteins inhibit signaling from a particular ligand via competition with the G-proteins that would normally promote signaling from the ligand-bound activated receptor. Therefore, in these experiments overexpression of G&#x003b1;12 may act as a dominant inhibitory molecule that prevents G&#x003b1;q-receptor interactions, which would normally activate FAK following Fractalkine coupling to US28. Overexpression of G&#x003b1;q prevents G&#x003b1;12 coupling to the RANTES-bound activated form of US28 thereby abrogating the downstream signaling to FAK. Therefore, RANTES stimulates varying signaling pathways through different G-proteins in SMC (G&#x003b1;12-dependent) and fibroblasts (G&#x003b1;i/o independent). Fractalkine signals from US28 via coupling of G&#x003b1;q in fibroblasts, SMC and macrophages. Together these findings demonstrate that not only is US28 signaling ligand-dependent and ligand-specific, it utilizes differential G-protein coupling to produce cell-type specific signaling and differential phenotypic responses.</p><p>In this report, we demonstrate that similar to RANTES and MCP-1, Fractalkine is a potent US28 agonist that promotes migration in macrophages, robust signaling through FAK and ERK1/2 and induces actin cytoskeletal rearrangements in fibroblasts. Unlike RANTES and MCP-1, Fractalkine fails to induce SMC migration, or increase expression of cellular genes involved in motility and signaling in SMC, thus demonstrating that US28 signaling is ligand-specific and cell type-specific. In addition, the US28 ligand-specific and cell-type dependent activation of differential signaling pathways suggest that this chemokine receptor has the capacity to couple to different G-proteins depending upon the ligand bound and the cellular G-protein environment. Therefore, US28 binds to a diversity of chemokines, which promote US28 coupling to multiple G-proteins, eliciting functional signaling through these various G-proteins. HCMV encounters and infects a multitude of distinct cell types <italic>in vivo</italic> including fibroblasts, monocyte/macrophages, endothelial cells and SMC. These cell types differ substantially with respect to the G-proteins that they express. The ability of US28 to respond to multiple signaling environments and couple to multiple G-proteins may have important implications in the persistence and pathogenesis of HCMV in these different cell-types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Lines</title><p>The life-extended human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell line, PAT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000304-Melnychuk1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> were maintained in Medium 199 supplemented with 20&#x00025; fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin-streptomycin-L-glutamine (PSG; Gibco).
