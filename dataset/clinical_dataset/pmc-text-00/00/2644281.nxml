Wistar rats anesthetized with urethane (<italic>n</italic> = 27) were allocated into the control (<italic>n</italic> = 10), ST-7 (Hsia-Kuan, <italic>n</italic> = 10) and LI-4 (Hoku, <italic>n</italic> = 7) groups. To measure organ blood flow, colored microspheres (CMS) were injected through a catheter positioned in the left ventricle and blood samples were drawn from the femoral artery. Yellow CMS (3.6&#x02013;4.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) and blue CMS (6.0&#x02013;6.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) were injected at intervals of about 30 min. An acupuncture needle (&#x003c6; 340 &#x003bc;m) was inserted into the left ST-7 point (left masseter muscle) or the right LI-4 point after the first sampling and left for about 30 min (10 twists at 1 Hz, 2-min intervals). The mean blood flow of nine organs varied widely from 4.03 to 0.20 (ml/min/g). Acupuncture to the ST-7 produced significant changes of the blood flow (percentage change from baseline) in the muscle, kidney, brain and heart (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, versus control), but those of LI-4 were not significant. The blood flow of the left masseter muscle after acupuncture to ST-7 (left masseter muscle) tended to increase (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08). Changes in blood pressure during the experimental periods were almost similar among these three groups. Acupuncture stimulation increases the blood flow of several organs by modulating the central circulatory systems, and the effects differed with sites of stimulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acupuncture</kwd><kwd>colored microsphere</kwd><kwd>organ blood flow</kwd><kwd>rat</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is known that acupuncture stimulation affects blood flow, and there are some studies for skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). We examined whether acupuncture not only stimulates a local area but also the blood flow of other organs, thus clarifying how acupuncture stimulates an organism. Since it is necessary to examine the effect on organ blood flow according to different areas of stimulation, the blood flow of various organs was measured in anesthetized rats using colored microspheres that can quantitatively measure multiple organ blood flow. We examined how acupuncture stimulation of the regions (Hsia-Kuan or Hoku) influenced the blood flow of various organs. Although microsphere measurement for regional blood flow has radiolabeled microspheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17">7&#x02013;17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and colored microspheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24 B25 B26 B27 B28">19&#x02013;28</xref>), we used the colored ones in this experiment. There are two techniques for colored microsphere measurement. One technique can calculate blood flow by counting the total number of microspheres in each sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22 B23">19&#x02013;23</xref>) and the other by extracting colored dye from the microsphere s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27 B28">24&#x02013;28</xref>). We used the latter technique in our experiment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation</title><p>After 24 h without food, Male Wistar rats (<italic>n</italic> = 27, body weight: 250&#x02013;420 g, free water intake) were anesthetized with intra-peritoneal injection (1.2 g/kg) of urethane. After tracheotomy, a cannula was inserted and a respirator artificially regulated breathing (respiratory frequency: 90 cycles/min, tidal air: 10 ml/kg, SN-480-7, Shinano, Japan). Pancuronium bromide (2 mg/kg) was administrated from a catheter that was placed in the jugular vein of rats. In addition, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the expiration was monitored (1H26, NEC) and maintained at about 3%. A second catheter (PE-50) was positioned in the right femoral artery to monitor blood pressure. The blood pressure and heart rate were recorded on a thermal array recorder (RTA-1200, Nihon Kohden). A third catheter (PE-10) was inserted into left ventricular via the right carotid artery for the colored microsphere injection. And, a fourth catheter (PE-50) was positioned in the left femoral artery for withdrawal of blood samples by a syringe pump at a rate of 0.84 ml/min (Model210, KD Scientific Inc. USA). The rectal temperature was monitored using a thermistor and maintained about 37.5&#x000b0;C by means of a heating pad (MK-900, Muromachi Kikai Co.). In this experiment, yellow and blue microspheres (15 &#x000b1; 0.2 &#x003bc;m, Dye-Track Triton Technology Inc. USA) were used to measure organ blood flow.</p><p>The experiment was divided into three groups. First group comprised the controls (<italic>n</italic> = 10, no stimulation). Second group was stimulated with acupuncture for 30 min at left ST-7 (<italic>n</italic> = 10, ST-7 group). The third group was stimulated by acupuncture for 30 min at right LI-4 (<italic>n</italic> = 7, LI-4 group). In the ST-7 group or LI-4 group, acupuncture was inserted into the left ST-7 (Hsia-Kuan, masseter muscle) or right LI-4 (Hoku) point (LI-4 is located on the dorsum of the hand, between the first and second finger) in the forelimb. Acupuncture stimulation was given using rotation (the needle was rotated right and left at 1 Hz) and was repeated 10 times at intervals of 2 min.</p><p>The position of the left ventricle catheter was confirmed by autopsy at the end of experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Blood Flow by Colored Microspheres</title><p>The infusion of colored microspheres started at least 60 min after surgery and confirmation of stabilized blood pressure and heartbeats. The microspheres were stirred with a test tube mixer (NS-80, Iuchiseieidou) for 5 min before infusion. The reference blood was drawn from 10 s before the microsphere infusion, and continued for 75 s. The microsphere (yellow or blue) infusion (20 s) was started 10 s after beginning to draw blood. Saline (0.5 ml) was then infused for 30 s to flush the microspheres in the catheter. In all experiments, yellow microspheres (0.12&#x02013;0.14 ml, 360 000&#x02013;420 000 microspheres) were injected first and blue (0.2&#x02013;0.23 ml, 600 000&#x02013;690 000 microspheres) ones second. After yellow injection, additional fluid was not replaced except by injection of blue. The injection of blue microspheres started 30 min after the first blood sampling was finished in the control group. In ST-7 or LI-4 group, acupuncture stimulation was applied after the first sampling. About 30 min after inserting the acupuncture needle, blue micro spheres were injected.</p><p>After the second blood sampling, cardiac arrest was achieved in the rats with potassium chloride. After the main large blood vessels were bound with a ligature, tissue samples that measure organ blood flow were excised and weighed. In the control, ST-7 and LI-4 group both masseter (right and left) and trapezius (right and left), or only masseter, kidney (right and left), stomach, small intestine, brain (divided into two samples, one including cerebrum and the other including the cerebellum), lung, heart, spleen and liver were excised.</p><p>Each tissue sample was put in a test tube, adding 4 M KOH containing 2% Tween 80 (16 M KOH containing 20% Tween 80 was added to the blood sample). Both tissue and blood samples were put at 60&#x000b0;C for 4 h in the dryer (FC-410, Toyo Seisakujyo). These samples were stirred with a test tube mixer per 1 h. Afterwards, tissue or blood samples were filtered under reduced pressure through a polyester filter to collect the microspheres. The filter and DMF (dimethylformamide) were put in the micro test tubes to dissolve dye from the microspheres in the solution after the filters dried. Then the filter was removed from the tube, and the solution was centrifuged (5 min, 4000 g and 3 min, 2000 g), and absorbance of the supernatant fluid was measured by a spectrophotometer (UV-1600, Shimadzu Seisakusho LTD.).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows examples of the absorbance by the above processing.

It can measure blood flow of multiple organs simultaneously. In principle, microspheres are trapped at the peripheral capillary, and when infusion volume increases, the measurement accuracy will rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, disturbances may occur in the rat's circulation. Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) described that a bolus injection of less than one million colored microspheres caused no significant hemodynamic disturbances in rats, and 500 000 colored microspheres were repeatedly injected up to four times (cumulative dose of 2 000 000 colored microspheres) without producing any adverse hemodynamic effects. Generally, blood vessels have the following diameters: capillaries are 1&#x02013;8 &#x003bc;m, arterioles are 20&#x02013;30 &#x003bc;m and arteriovenous anastomoses are 2&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;m. Therefore, if 15 &#x003bc;m microspheres are used, a measurement of true capillaries or nutrient blood flow will result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and many researchers use 15 &#x003bc;m microspheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17">7&#x02013;17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27 B28">24&#x02013;28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31 B32">29&#x02013;32</xref>). In our experiment, we used 15 &#x003bc;m colored microspheres with a density of 1.0&#x02013;1.09 g/ml and the colored microspheres were suspended in distilled water. In this experiment, infusion volume of blue microspheres increased more than yellow microspheres, because blue needs a greater number of microspheres than yellow to obtain the same absorbance from colored dye extraction of blue and yellow microspheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Some values of mean organ blood flow values (ml/min/g) in rats are reported by measuring microspheres.</p><p>The mean organ blood flow of other investigations (ml/min/g) was also measured by microspheres in rats.

Blood pressure decreased significantly from the time of the first blood sampling and after the second. Though we considered that the infusion volume of microspheres in this experiment would not cause significant change in blood flow, these results were beyond expectation. Though the reason is unclear, it may have been caused by microspheres being caught in capillaries. In results of blood flow measurement using colored microspheres and Laser Doppler in the small intestines of anesthetized rats, Wahlberg <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) described that blood flow and blood pressure decreased when the second infusion of 120 000&#x02013;140 000 microspheres (cumulative dose of 240 000&#x02013;280 000 microspheres) was done. They suggested that microspheres trapped in capillaries were the cause. From this evidence, we consider that a low volume of microsphere infusion is needed to achieve stable organ blood flow.</p><p>There was a significant increase of blood flow in the muscle, kidney, brain and heart between the control group and ST-7 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). These results suggest that acupuncture stimulation affected blood flow of multiple organs. Lee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) reported that acupuncture stimulation by twirling at GO-26 (located at midpoint of the philtrum) for 30 min caused significant increase in stroke volume and cardiac output, and a significant decrease in total peripheral resistance in anesthetized dogs. Meanwhile, mean blood pressure and heart rate did not change significantly. In our experiment, we found no significant temporal change of mean blood pressure and heart rate between the control and ST-7 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), when acupuncture was performed at the trigeminal area (close to the area that Lee stimulated in the ST-7 group). Perhaps that acupuncture might cause an increase in stroke volume and decrease in total peripheral resistance. As a result, although mean blood pressure did not change significantly, it is still possible that blood flow of each organ was affected.</p><p>In the case of acupuncture to the left masseter, muscle blood flow of the left masseter tended to increase more than the right masseter (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08). This phenomenon suggests that acupuncture increased muscle blood flow by some peripheral mechanism. Robert Porszasz <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) reported antidromic vasodilatation in the striated muscle of rats, and there is a research paper suggesting that the axon reflex in the skeletal muscle may occur with acupuncture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). From the above, we considered that peripheral mechanisms such as antidromic vasodilation and axon reflex may contribute to the increase of blood flow of the area stimulated by acupuncture. However, acupuncture not only increases blood flow of the stimulated area, but also simultaneously increased multiple organ blood flow including brain in comparison with the control group, suggesting that organ blood flow in the whole body in being influenced through the central nervous system (CNS) without change in blood pressure. It is also possible that polymodal receptors take part as peripheral receptors of acupuncture stimulation. Polymodal receptors are distributed throughout the body and react to mechanical, nociceptive and chemical stimulation. Polymodal receptors fully react by acupuncture stimulation in this experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Polymodal receptors also cause axon reflex in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). For these reasons, we consider that polymodal receptors are the peripheral receptors of acupuncture stimulation. Below, we describe our hypothesis for the mechanism of acupuncture stimulation on blood flow of various organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Acupuncture stimulation increases blood flow of the stimulated area by causing axon reflex via polymodal receptors and increased stroke volume and cardiac output, as well as a decrease in total peripheral resistance via CNS at the same time.</p><p>Furthermore, to examine organ blood flow with a different stimulation point, LI-4 was selected, because LI-4 is often used clinically in acupuncture treatment. Our results differed from those of the ST-7 group in that there was no significant difference between the control and LI-4 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). This suggests that organ blood flow is affected differently by stimulating different points. We considered that the regulation mechanism of the automatic nerve system is different, because ST-7 (trigeminal nerve area) and LI-4 (spinal nerve area) have different innervations.<fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Percentage change of organ blood flow in the control group and LI-4 group. It shows box and whisker plot of percentage change of organ blood flow in the control group and LI-4 group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nem068f6"/></fig><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Hypothesis of acupuncture on the blood flow of various organs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nem068f7"/></fig></p><p>Adachi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) reported that noxious mechanical stimulation of the skin on the hind paw, forepaw or face caused a significant increase in cerebral blood flow in anesthetized rats, whereas noxious mechanical stimulation of the back failed to produce any significant changes in cortical blood flow. They speculated that differences in magnitude of changes in cortical blood flow and blood pressure elicited by similar stimulation of different cutaneous areas may be related to differences in conduction of impulses and/or in density of innervations of different skin areas. In addition, Noguchi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) reported that electro-acupuncture stimulation of a hind paw produced an increase in skeletal muscle blood flow in muscle biceps femoral's of hind limbs accompanied by an increase in systemic arterial blood pressure in anesthetized rats. Ohsawa <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) reported that acupuncture like stimulation (the needle was twisted right and left) of an area corresponding to Tzu-San-Li point in humans induced a decrease in mean arterial pressure which was accompanied by a decrease in renal sympathetic nerve activity in anesthetized rats, and it is also known that electrical acupuncture stimulation of Tzu-San-Li in anesthetized rats produce depressor of mean arterial pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Inoue <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) reported that manual acupuncture stimulation of 10 mm lateral to the L6 vertebra spinous process in anesthetized rats (the needle was rotated) did not produce consistent changes in sciatic nerve blood flow, with increased and decreased blood flow as well as no change in observed blood flow. Sugiyama reported that manual acupuncture (the needle was rotated) of the Tsu-San-Li point in human produced an increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). All these reports suggest that different methods or regions of acupuncture stimulation influence blood pressure and autonomic nerves differently.</p><p>While conventional acupuncture research on the circulatory system has targeted individual organs or tissue blood flow, our method of using colored microsphere may be the first time that we have been able to grasp changes in multiple organ blood flow by acupuncture at the same time. It is our hope that these results have great significance for future acupuncture research.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation
