We focus here on the tunicate <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, which has the capacity to regenerate nerves and a complete adult central nervous system, a capacity unusual in the chordate phylum. We investigated the timing and sequence of events during nervous system regeneration in this organism.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We developed techniques for reproducible ablations and for imaging live cellular events in tissue explants. Based on live observations of more than 100 regenerating animals, we subdivided the regeneration process into four stages. Regeneration was functional, as shown by the sequential recovery of reflexes that established new criteria for defining regeneration rates. We used transgenic animals and labeled nucleotide analogs to describe in detail the early cellular events at the tip of the regenerating nerves and the first appearance of the new adult ganglion anlage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The rate of regeneration was found to be negatively correlated with adult size. New neural structures were derived from the anterior and posterior nerve endings. A blastemal structure was implicated in the formation of new neural cells.

A third type of reflex response never seen in normal animals was then observed. This response consisted of the retraction of the stimulated siphon only (type C response) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004458-g003">Fig. 3a</xref> and Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004458.s003">Video S2</xref>). Animals in these conditions were much less reactive. During the regenerative process, type C responses gradually disappeared with time and the type A response was re-established. Type B responses seemed to be an intermediate, observed transiently in regenerating animals. Another transient state was also observed: a type C response followed by the slow, delayed closure of the non stimulated siphon. These observations allowed us to establish a framework for monitoring functional regeneration in <italic>Ciona</italic>.</p><p>We carried out the SST on the regenerating animals used in the morphological study described above, and scored changes in the frequencies of the different types of response as regeneration proceeded. The frequency of each response was calculated following the stimulation of both siphons and was plotted against time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004458-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The transition from one response to another (C&#x02192;B and B&#x02192;A) was identified as the intersection point of the two response curves. For example, the C&#x02192;B atrial transition occurred at 13 days post ablation (dpa) for medium-sized animals and 19 dpa for large animals, indicating that size played an important role in determining the rate of reflex recovery. The C&#x02192;B transition required the completion of stage III. This morphological stage includes the first rejoining of nerve endings, supporting the intuitive conclusion that this connection is required to link the response of the two siphons. The B&#x02192;A transition occurred later, when the morphological connection was strengthened and integrated during stage IV. Once again, the formation of a ganglion can be linked with the recovery of a pattern of behavior that had been lost.</p><p>The <bold>tentacle stimulation test</bold> (TST) is a variant of another test known as crossed response stimulation. Mackie <italic>et al.</italic> 2006 used this method to provoke the partial closure of the atrial siphon following stimulation of the tentacles in the oral siphon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004458-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p>The tentacle stimulation test was more difficult to perform than the SST and was used principally to illustrate another type of functional regeneration/recovery. The TST involves placing an ablated animal next to a non ablated animal and comparing the responses of the two animals to similar stimulations. If the tentacles in the oral siphon were touched without touching the siphon wall, the atrial siphon closed halfway and then opened again, as described in detail by Mackie <italic>et al.</italic> (2006) (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004458.s004">Video S3</xref>). In our test, we allowed the animals to lie on their sides and inserted a very fine needle (Wolfram 0.1 mm diameter) into the oral siphon to stimulate the tentacles. In normal animals, the crossed reflex was systematically observed, but only after an average of two attempts. Touching the wall or other parts of the siphon led to a type B response, as described above. Some of the regenerating animals displayed a crossed response after regeneration, but we were unable to determine an average time point for this test, as it took place later than stage IV. We conclude that the TST can be used to estimate the functional endpoint of regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Rate of Regeneration as a function of morphology and size</title><p>The four stages of regeneration had similar time courses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004458-t001">Table 1</xref>).

The exact nature of these cells remains unknown, but there appeared to be at least two different populations.

We concluded from stereomicroscopy studies that new structures originated from the residual neural structures on all sides of the ablation area, not only from the posterior regions containing the dorsal strand. We decided to focus our attention on individual regenerating nerve endings, following their regeneration by confocal microscopy in transgenic animals. Before ablation, the nerves were not thickened, and only some of the nerves had GFP-positive cell bodies close to the area of the intended lesion. Immediately after ablation, we identified axonal material, defined by the accumulation of GFP released from the nerve endings. At stage I (2 dpa, 14&#x000b0;C), the nerve endings were slightly thickened and a few cell bodies positive for the transgene were observed among the other negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004458-g005">Fig. 5f&#x02013;h</xref>). At the start of stage II (4 dpa, 14&#x000b0;C), the nerve ending was thickened and a mass of cells formed, many of which were GFP-positive.

All the nerves, including the lateral and anterior ones that had been cut showed this pattern of regeneration. At the start of stage III (9 dpa, 14&#x000b0;C), the cell mass began to change, with some cell bodies being left behind and axons and cells being sent out centrally towards the other nerves, even extending into newly formed tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004458-g005">Fig. 5m&#x02013;o</xref>).</p><p>Time-lapse analysis of the regenerating nerve endings showed extensive path-finding activity, with neurites and growth cones forming and collapsing (Supp. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004458.s005">Video S4</xref>).

As expected, the area immediately around the hole displayed high levels of proliferation. Adjacent to the nerve endings there was a small zone of unlabeled cells.

However, <italic>Corella</italic> and <italic>Chelyosoma</italic> do not regenerate a complete neural complex. We therefore decided to study regeneration in <italic>Ciona</italic> regeneration, as we did not wish to extrapolate between species.</p><p>The simple siphon stimulation test (SST) generated up to three sequentially separable reflexes during CNS regeneration. Investigation of the transitions between these reflexes over time, at a high temporal resolution, provides a precise tool for helping stage identification. Our studies of the temporal recovery of physiological reflexes also open up new possibilities for more detailed studies of the effects of temperature, food, stress and genetic pathways on regeneration. The reflexes tested are easy to study and change considerably in response to ablation. The sequential nature of the recovery makes it possible to combine morphological and/or ecological tests with behavioral tests thereby linking parameters of qualitatively different characters and making the <italic>Ciona</italic> model very tractable.</p><p>We provide evidence that regeneration rate is dependent on size. Smaller animals regenerate faster than larger animals, as also shown by the functional study. Bollner defined adults as animals more than 50 mm long, all of which had mature gametes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004458-Bollner3">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Lender and Bouchard-Madrelle (1964) provided no information about the size or age of the animals they used, but we can assume that they were adults. The ablation procedure is easier to perform on larger animals, so large adults were probably used in these studies. It is difficult to estimate the age of wild-type <italic>Ciona</italic>. As stated above, size differs both within and between age groups. <italic>Ciona</italic> settle throughout the summer season (May to September, Swedish west coast), with fecundity peaking in June. They live for 12 to 18 months and retain their ability to regenerate throughout the summer season. In warmer waters, they are reported to spawn throughout the year. In our conditions, regenerative capability decreased in late fall, probably because of lower water temperatures, lower algae concentrations and the aging of the individuals.</p><p>Few studies have taken size into account as a factor affecting regeneration or growth. In most studies, this issue has been avoided by comparing animals of similar size. In a study of regeneration in brittlestars, size did not affect the rate of regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004458-Dupont1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the extensive variation in regeneration rate observed in <italic>Ciona</italic>, particularly as a function of temperature, we investigated the effects of size on regeneration rate in more detail. The reason for the inverse correlation between size and regeneration rate is unknown, but may have more to do with age than size. However, it was not possible to test this hypothesis, because we could not determine the age of animals collected in the wild. It should be possible to overcome this limitation by using laboratory-reared animals of the same age, but reared under different conditions (e.g. rich or poor food regimen) and therefore differing in size. By comparing such animals, and animals of the same size but different ages, it may be possible to determine which of these two factors is the most important.</p><p>Our detailed stereomicroscopy analysis has provided insight into the kinetics of neural complex regeneration in <italic>Ciona</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004458-Lender1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004458-Bollner3">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Using transgenic animals and confocal microscopy, we were also able to study in detail various cellular aspects of regeneration. Nerve regeneration starts soon after ablation, and thickened nerve endings soon extend and join adjacent neural structures. We have shown that cells accumulate around the severed nerve endings. Remarkably, this occurs not only from the posterior side, but from all around the ablation area. Thus, each severed nerve ending has the potential to organize new structures, which later establish connections with other adjacent nerve endings. Using time-lapse imaging and explants, we showed that these cells extended axons and growth cones toward other nerve endings. We also confirmed observations of the sprouting of fibers from nerve cell masses and observed cell bodies leaving the mass of cells and following the fibers at a later stage of regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004458-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>Our findings revise the former view that no neuronal cell bodies are associated with the nerves outside the ganglion. Indeed, we observed neural cell bodies along the nerve in areas organized into mini-ganglia, together with a loose network adjacent to the ganglion. Some of these cells are probably similar to those described by Koyama in electron microscopy studies of <italic>Polyandrocarpa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004458-Koyama1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. However, no large neural cell bodies were visible anywhere other than in the ganglion in this previous study. Difficulties visualizing the small neurites extending from these neural cells probably account for these cells being overlooked in previous studies. This problem was resolved by our use of the GFP transgenic line.</p><p>It remains unclear where the new cells accumulating at nerve endings come from. Consistent with the observations of Bollner and coworkers (1997), we observed extensive proliferation in the dorsal strand (data not shown). This structure is clearly a possible source for the cells contributing to regeneration. However, we also found that nerve cells formed at the edge of the regenerating nerve ending and identified a potential &#x0201c;blastema&#x0201d;. The blastema is a regenerative unit (analogous to the developmental bud) composed of a mass of undifferentiated cells capable of forming regenerative tissue. This structure has been found in most cases of regeneration, although its form is highly variable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004458-Cebria1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004458-Akimenko1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004458-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The presence of a blastema at anterior nerve endings suggests that the new nerve cells of the regenerating ganglion are unlikely to be derived from the cells of the dorsal strand or the associated plexus. Indeed, these structures are much further away. We cannot rule out the possibility that undifferentiated cells, such as the pluripotent cells in planarians or colonial tunicates, migrate and turn into neurons. However, morphologically, nerves seem to reform or at least to steer the reformation of their own network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004458-Agata1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004458-Rinkevich1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our confocal time-lapse microscopy studies detected no movement of GFP-positive cell bodies along the axons toward the cut nerve during the first 36 h. Thus, although further studies are required to determine more definitively the source of the cells present in the nerve cell mass, we believe that the blastemal formation we describe here is the most likely source of the cells involved in regeneration of the neural ganglion. However, the cellular composition of the blastema remains unknown.</p><p>We present here a model suitable for use in further studies of <italic>Ciona</italic> CNS regeneration. We hope to have provided a strong basis, extending from description of the physiological response to cellular events and the associated key morphological stages.</p><p>In vertebrates, only neural structures displaying continuous adult neurogenesis seem to be capable of regeneration (the visual system of teleostean fishes is a case in point). However, it has recently been shown that zebrafish spinal cord can not only regenerate motor neurons but also produce new ones in response to lesions in areas that are not normally neurogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004458-Reimer1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Ciona</italic> is a chordate, like other efficient regeneration models such as salamanders and fish, and is more distantly related to other models, such as planarians. However, <italic>Ciona</italic> regeneration differs from vertebrate regeneration in several ways.

However, one potential problem with the use of this model is the apparently polymorphic background in <italic>Ciona</italic>, making genetic investigations more complex than those in models with constant genetic backgrounds, such as <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Further studies using the methods described here should document regeneration in the diverse <italic>Ciona</italic> populations found worldwide.</p><p>With the advent of UV-convertible reporter genes, such as KAEDE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004458-Ando1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and the probable construction of inducible genetic lines in <italic>Ciona</italic>, we will have tools that, together with these findings, will make it possible to address questions relating to cell fate and lineage and the function of unknown genes.

All animals were kept in running seawater from the Gullmarsfjord taken from 5 meters below the surface (July&#x02013;August 2007). Salinity varied over the study period, from 21 to 29 PSU, with a mean value of 24. The temperature of the water varied over the period, from 16 to 20.5&#x000b0; C, with a mean value of 17.5&#x000b0; C. Approximately 20 animals were kept in an 18 liter aquarium, with a water flow rate of &#x0223c;2 l/ min. No additional food was supplied. The animals were retained in suspended hard net baskets within the aquarium, to separate them from fecal material. Tanks were cleaned by siphoning every two days.</p><p>Adult transgenic animals were kept in the same way as wild-type animals, but with a lower water flow rate, necessitating daily feeding with <italic>Rhodomonas spp.</italic>. Experiments were also performed later in the season (September&#x02013;October), when salinity varied from 22 to 29 PSU, with a mean value of 25. Water temperature over this period varied from 12.5 to 15.5&#x000b0; C, with a mean value of 14&#x000b0; C. All water in contact with transgenic animals was sterilized by UV irradiation and handled according to local regulations.</p><p>Individual animals were labeled by injecting a combination of colored drops of an elastomer paint (VIE, Northwest Marine Technology) under the tunic, close to the site of attachment.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>E&#x0005b;MiTSAdTPOG&#x0005d;15 promoter transgenic animals</title><p>Adult <italic>Ciona</italic> of the E&#x0005b;MiTSAdTPOG&#x0005d;15 transgenic line were obtained at the Shimoda Marine Research Center (Awazu et al., 2007). E15 expressed the GFP gene in most neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Ablation technique and anesthetic</title><p>Animals were anesthetized with MS222 (0.4 g/l) or propylene phenoxetol (0.06&#x00025;) in seawater for 15 to 30 minutes before ablation, dissection or live imaging. Ablations were carried out with fine forceps and biopsy punch tools (2 and 3 mm diameter; Stiefel&#x000ae; biopsy punch; ablation technique described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004458.s001">Table S1</xref> and visible in Supplemental. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004458.s002">Video S1</xref>). By stabilizing the tissues with the forceps, we were able to remove the entire ganglion and the gland including the ciliated funnel and dorsal tubercle in a single action, minimizing trauma. The use of Sylgard&#x000ae;-coated Petri dishes (Sylgard&#x000ae; 184 Silicone Elastomer) was found to be essential. In our hands, this technique gave consistently better results than traditional microdissection. The complete sedation and opacity of animals also affected the likelihood of success. In the smallest individuals used, mortality levels were significantly higher than in controls that did not undergo ablation (&#x0003c;5&#x00025;). This probably due to poor ablation and to smaller animals being unable to cope with repeated openings of the tunic. Mortality rates were so high in the smallest group that this group was excluded from the physiological reflex experiment. Previous experiments with other transgenic lines indicated that animals reared in Gif-sur-Yvette had more transparent tunics and mantles and were amenable to imaging without iterative tunic opening.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Live imaging</title><p>For visualization of regeneration of the neural complex, we anesthetized individuals every other day, and analyzed and photographed the area of regeneration for each of the 30 animals of different sizes. The tunic was opened or cleaned when necessary, to facilitate these analyses, but we paid particular attention not to disturb tissues early in the healing process. The ability of <italic>Ciona</italic> to survive short periods without water and the possibility of repeated sedation made it possible to use live imaging with a dissecting microscope. This was important as it allowed us to follow regeneration in the same individual, at frequent intervals. Images were acquired with a Leica MZ 16 A stereomicroscope and LAS software.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Nomarski images</title><p>Nomarski images were taken of small specimens of <italic>Ciona</italic>, which were sedated and then microdissected and mounted under a coverslip, fixed <italic>in situ</italic> with 4&#x00025; PFA and then transferred through a series of glycerol solutions of increasing concentration, up to 100&#x00025; glycerol.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Confocal imaging of whole animals</title><p>Confocal imaging of regenerating whole <italic>Ciona</italic> was carried out principally with small individuals, with part of the semi-opaque tunic removed. The animals were placed under light pressure imposed by a small piece of glass, in a chamber with a coverslip at the bottom (Lab-Tek, NUNC). Images of fixed animals were collected with a Leica SP5 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope and images of living animals were collected with multiphoton laser scanning microscope (MLSM). Animals were not harmed by the procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Explant preparation</title><p>Animals were sedated as described above, and prepared as described in supplementary material <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004458.s002">Table S1</xref>. The resulting glass-bottomed chambers (Lab-Tek, NUNC) with dorsal preparations were used for the imaging of live cells and for following cells by time-lapse confocal microscopy.</p><p>This procedure was used for all close visualization of nerve endings. The medium in the chambers was either filtered seawater (FSW) supplemented with 10 &#x000b5;g/ml kanamycin and 50 &#x000b5;g/ml gentamycin, or FSW supplemented with cell culture medium (L-15 Leibowitz, Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 &#x000b5;g/ml gentamycin. Tissue integrity, lack of symbionts, and closure of the ablation hole were used as indicators of a viable preparation.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>EdU incubations and staining for GFP</title><p>Newly proliferating cells in the early stages of regeneration were labeled by incubation in 200 &#x000b5;M EdU (Invitrogen) in 100 ml of seawater for 16 h. Incubations were performed two days after ablation. Whole-mount preparations were fixed by incubation with 0.4&#x00025; PFA and washed in 0.1&#x00025; Tween 20 in 1&#x000d7; PBS. They were stained with antibodies against GFP (1&#x02236;500 dilution of rabbit primary GFP antibody (A11122) and a 1&#x02236;200 dilution of mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to Alexa 594 (A11037) from Molecular Probes). EdU was then detected with the procedure recommended by Invitrogen. We used Alexa Fluor azide 647 to detect the EdU-positive cells. Preparations were incubated for 15 minutes with a 1&#x02236;100,000 dilution of DAPI (Sigma, D9542) and rinsed in PBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Behavioral responses</title><p>Wildtype <italic>Ciona</italic> were stimulated in their aquaria in a random order; first orally and, about 5 min later, atrially; without prior disturbance. The types of response were scored following two stimulations. To score a crossed reflex positive, the response had to be observed twice, in connection with a visual touch of the tentacle (see Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004458.s003">Video S2</xref>). The experiments were always performed by one person stimulating the tentacle and another one scoring responses. In this way the crossed reflex is easily identified even though it is often followed by a type B response (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Rate of regeneration &#x00026; Statistics</title><p>Regeneration rates were compared across individual sizes, by scoring the attainment of various structural characters at a given time point after ablation. Individuals were classified according to size. The &#x0201c;medium&#x0201d; group corresponded to animals with a mean length of 6 cm (max 7.5, min 4.5), a mean drip-dry weight of 3 g (max 5.5, min 1.5) and a mean width of 1.5 cm (max 1.8, min 1.1). The &#x0201c;large&#x0201d; group corresponded to animals with a mean length of 11 cm (max 15, min 7.9), a mean drip-dry weight of 16.7 g (max 25.9, min 7.7) and a mean width of 2.4 cm (max 3.3, min 1.8). The &#x0201c;small&#x0201d; corresponded to animals smaller than those of the preceding two groups and was omitted due to high mortality rates.</p><p>Each mean value is expressed with its standard error (mean&#x000b1;SEM). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests were used to determine the significance of the observed differences between groups. A simple linear regression model was used to assess the type of relationship between variables. All statistical methods used (ANOVA, linear regression) assume that the data are normally distributed. Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk's (1965) statistic (W) was used to check that the data were a random sample from a normal distribution.
