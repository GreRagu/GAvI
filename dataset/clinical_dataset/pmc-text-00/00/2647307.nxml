After R-M genes enter a new cell, MTase activity must appear before REase or the host chromosome will be cleaved. Temporal control of these genes thus has life-or-death consequences. PvuII and some other R-M systems delay endonuclease expression by cotranscribing the REase gene with the upstream gene for an autogenous activator/repressor (C protein). C.PvuII was previously shown to have low levels early, but positive feedback later boosts transcription of the C and REase genes. The MTase is expressed without delay, and protects the host DNA. C.PvuII binds to two sites upstream of its gene: O<sub>L</sub>, associated with activation, and O<sub>R</sub>, associated with repression. Even when symmetry elements of each operator are made identical, C.PvuII binds preferentially to O<sub>L</sub>. In this study, the intra-operator spacers are shown to modulate relative C.PvuII affinity. In light of a recently reported C.Esp1396I-DNA co-crystal structure, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of altering O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>R</sub> spacers were determined. The results suggest that the GACTnnnAGTC consensus is the primary determinant of C.PvuII binding affinity, with intra-operator spacers playing a fine-tuning role that affects mobility of this R-M system.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Many bacteria and archaea possess restriction-modification (R-M) systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), at least in part for defense against DNA bacteriophages. PvuII, like other type II R-M systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), includes two separate enzymes: a restriction endonuclease (REase) that cleaves DNA at a target sequence, and a methyltransferase (MTase) that modifies the same sequence to protect it from the cognate REase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8">3&#x02013;8</xref>).</p><p>The PvuII R-M system is naturally carried on a plasmid together with mobilization genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). If the system is to be mobile, the REase and MTase activities must be carefully balanced in a relatively host-independent manner, so as to minimize killing of new host cells that initially have completely unmethylated chromosomes. Any R-M system misregulation would lead to auto-restriction and cell death if REase activity is too high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), or would weaken defense against bacteriophage invasion if MTase activity is too high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In addition to the evident effects of R-M systems on resistance to bacteriophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), the roles of restriction in modulating gene flow between bacteria are also clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18 B19">15&#x02013;19</xref>). The regulation of R-M systems having only REase and MTase genes is under active investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>A subset of type II R-M systems contains regulatory genes in addition to the MTase and REase genes. The regulatory C (controlling) gene was first discovered in the PvuII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and BamHI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) R-M systems. Subsequently, active regulatory genes have been demonstrated in several other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The C proteins are quite small [PvuII has a subunit MW of 9.4 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>)] and appear to have a remarkably broad host range for their action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>C proteins, where tested, activate and repress their own transcription autogenously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In the PvuII R-M system at least (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B), the C protein is responsible for delayed REase appearance after entering a new host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>); this gives the MTase time to protect the new host's genome. In R-M systems having a C gene, the REase gene typically does not have its own promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) [exceptions are LlaI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and KpnI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>)]. The C and REase open reading frames usually overlap, and the REase gene is completely dependent on transcription from the upstream autogenously regulated C gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Disruption of <italic>pvuIIC</italic> leads to a drastic reduction in REase expression, that can be restored by supplying the C gene <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In a new host cell REase expression is low until C protein accumulates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that pre-expressing C protein prevents transformation by the intact cognate R-M system, presumably due to premature REase expression and cleavage of recipient cells&#x02019; chromosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>PvuII R-M system control region. <bold>(A)</bold> Genetic structure.

We have previously explored the roles of the GACTnnnAGTC symmetry elements and the inter-operator TGTA spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). We found that any substitution within the TGTA eliminated transcription activation by C.PvuII, and noted that the PvuII-related C-boxes fall into two classes based on this spacer (TGTA versus CGTA), with co-variation of the cognate C protein predicted recognition helices (<underline>H</underline>RTY versus <underline>D</underline>RTY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>The palindromic nature of C boxes suggests that each of the two C boxes (designated as 1AB or O<sub>L</sub>, operator left, and 2AB or O<sub>R</sub>, operator right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) could each be bound by the helix&#x02013;turn&#x02013;helix motifs of a C protein homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). The two operators have conserved center-to-center spacing of 15 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), meaning that the two C homodimers occupy opposite faces of the DNA double helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a C protein&#x02013;DNA operator co-crystal structure was solved for C.Esp1396I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). As expected, the two C protein dimers interact with C-box DNA on opposite faces of the DNA. Surprisingly, a second symmetry pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) (yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) was identified in addition to the one previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) (blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The center of symmetry is shifted by 0.5 nt between the two patterns. The C.Esp1396I protein&#x02212;DNA co-crystal structure suggests that the second symmetry pattern is indeed recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). However, the relative roles of the two symmetries are not yet clear.<fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Testing the two alternative symmetry patterns in the C-box region.

Further, when the GACTnnnAGCT symmetry elements of O<sub>L</sub> and O<sub>R</sub> are made identical, activation still occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).

The WT PvuII C box region differs from the symmetrical pattern at just two of 16 positions: in boxes 1A (GACT&#x02192;<underline>T</underline>ACT) and 2A (GACT&#x02192;GA<underline>T</underline>T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and C). Logo analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>) for C proteins having a HRTY recognition helix revealed that the central 4-nt TGTA spacer is more highly conserved than the symmetry elements themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).

This result suggested that the two 3-bp intra-operator spacer sequences (and/or their associated alternative symmetry) might determine the relative affinity of C.PvuII for the two operators. Logo analysis reveals that the preferred sequence for both operator spacers is TAT, with particularly high conservation of the A position at the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C).

In two cases, both operator spacers (O<sub>L</sub>/O<sub>R</sub>) were identical: CAT/CAT (pIM10) or CAA/CAA (pIM13).

For WT C-boxes, as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), activation was seen with a peak 1.5-fold above baseline at about 0.02% arabinose, followed by strong repression at 0.2% arabinose to the level of the negative control (vector, no <italic>pvuIIC</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). All tested intra-operator spacer variants, except for the reciprocally exchanged spacers (pIM14), showed very similar transcription profiles, though peak heights varied. The WT C-box fusions gave the highest maximal activation of the tested variants. The reciprocally exchanged spacer variant (CAA/CAT; pIM14) showed the same general profile with respect to inducer concentration, but with substantially decreased expression (about 10-fold less at peak) than its WT symmetrical variant at peak (pIM8).</p><p>A most striking finding was that the peak of expression for tested spacer variants depended on the spacer sequence in O<sub>L</sub>, but not in O<sub>R</sub>. We normalized the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A to the highest expression for each variant, to facilitate their comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). The two variants with CAA in O<sub>L</sub> (regardless of the O<sub>R</sub> spacer sequence) gave peak expression at 0.002% arabinose, in contrast to variants with CAT in O<sub>L</sub>, for which the peak was at 0.02% arabinose. The ascending part of the expression profiles at C.PvuII concentration presumably correspond to the relative binding affinity of the activating operator O<sub>L</sub> with CAA, which may be higher than with CAT spacer.</p><p>We next tested the levels of reporter gene transcription fused to the various C-box spacer variants in the context of the entire WT PvuII R-M system carried on the pBR322 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), producing the physiological C.PvuII concentration in the cells growing exponentially at 37&#x000b0;C in MOPS-glucose media (as described in &#x02018;Materials and methods&#x02019; section). The WT C.PvuII level is close to that produced in 0.008% arabinose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) as also shown by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D). The expression of each variant (black bars; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) was compared to the position on the titration profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). As a negative control, we used vector without the <italic>pvuIIC</italic> gene (white bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), and saw minimal expression due to C.PvuII-independent promoter activity.

From this information alone, one might expect the two intra-operator spacers to have equivalent effects with respect to C.PvuII binding. We asked if the intra-operator spacers might be involved in the determination of relative C.PvuII affinity to O<sub>L</sub> and whether the <italic>in vivo</italic> observations might be due to differential affinity binding.</p><p>We tested this in two ways, via EMSA and competition EMSA. We used 126-bp PCR products, amplified from various plasmids, at a fixed concentration of 20 nM. The 26-bp C boxes were located at the center of the amplification product, flanked on each side by 50 bp of DNA. For each variant we used 0&#x02013;300 nM C.PvuII. As with the <italic>in vivo lacZ</italic> fusions described above, we exchanged the two native intra-operator spacers, or made them equivalent. The EMSA results for all intra-operator spacer variants show the same distinct low-mobility complex obtained for WT C-boxes [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and Figure S3A]. C.PvuII has substantially greater affinity for the fully symmetrical C-box variants than for the WT C-boxes, based on disappearance of the unshifted complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>A and S1A). We tested this result further via competition EMSA, using unlabeled variant DNA fragments in 1-, 2.5-, 5- or 10-fold molar excess with a fixed amount of biotin-labeled WT C-box DNA. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>B and S4B) indicate significantly higher C.PvuII affinity for O<sub>L</sub> with a CAA spacer than with a CAT spacer. With O<sub>L</sub> = CAA, 10-fold excess of competitor resulted in nearly 90% loss of the shifted band; in contrast, the same amount of O<sub>L</sub> = CAT competitor led to loss of only about 30% of the shifted complex. The O<sub>R</sub> spacer appears to have a smaller effect on net C.PvuII affinity than the O<sub>L</sub> spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), even though the flanking GATCnnnAGTC symmetry elements of each operator were identical.

We did not expect a large net bending angle, because the 15-bp center-to-center spacing of the operators places them on opposite faces of the DNA helix, and bends at each operator should partially cancel one another. In fact, for the C.Esp1396I tetramer, the overall bend angle calculated from crystal structure analysis is about 43&#x000b0; and results from the two individual bends imposed by each dimer related by 150&#x000b0; rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>We compared bend angle calculated for WT C-boxes and the symmetrical variant with CAA spacer in O<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>).

The wild-type PvuII R-M system showed no significant difference in EOT from the vector control pBR322 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The nonrepressing plasmid (pIM6), pIM20 (WT spacers, fully symmetrical C boxes) and pIM17 (spacer O<sub>L</sub> = O<sub>R</sub> = CAT) showed similar about 3-fold reductions in EOT.

A rise in MTase expression would result in greater number of methylated PvuII sites within the second plasmid, detectible by digestion with cognate PvuII REase. For these experiments we also tested M.PvuII substitution associated with the C-box symmetrization. Tested plasmids with M.PvuII variants, were: pBadMT2 (N4S/S10R, symmetrized C-box) and pBadMT3 (N4S/M8L/S10R, symmetrized and with CAA sequence in O<sub>L</sub> spacer). The degree of DNA protection under the same conditions of increasing MTase expression levels was compared for the three variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). The DNA was clearly protected by lower levels of WT M.PvuII than for the two other MTase variants (compare lane 7 for each MTase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). However, the somewhat lower establishment of the PvuII R-M system with symmetrized C-boxes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) might be associated with reduced protection by M.PvuII (N4S/S10R). No difference in protection is obvious between variants N4S/S10R and N4S/M8L/S10R.

C-boxes of the PvuII family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) have two GACT(N<sub>3</sub>)AGTC (consensus) palindromes, separated by a 4-bp inter-operator spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C).

Both symmetries, abbreviated &#x02018;AGTC&#x02019; and &#x02018;TATA&#x02019; (the latter spanning the intra-operator sequence), are well conserved in C.PvuII family C-boxes, though with slightly less conservation of the &#x02018;TATA&#x02019; match within O<sub>R</sub> than within O<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The C.Esp1396I structure reveals a center of symmetry shifted by 0.5 nt relative to the &#x02018;AGTC&#x02019; consensus, with the center of the &#x02018;TATA&#x02019; pattern at the &#x02018;T&#x02019; of the CGTG central spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).

The <italic>pvuIIM</italic> and <italic>pvuIICR</italic> promoters do not overlap one another, and C.PvuII has little if any effect on <italic>pvuIIM</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In addition, the translation initiation area for <italic>pvuIIM</italic> is on the opposite strand (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), with the codons for the MTase N-terminus overlapping the C.PvuII-binding region. Generating symmetrical consensus C-boxes resulted in two single-aa changes to the MTase.</p><p>We found no effect of our C-box alterations on MTase translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Coupled <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription-translation previously indicated that M.PvuII is made in two forms, corresponding to translation starts from the first and fourth AUG, and that the shorter form is about 20-fold more abundant than the larger form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Interestingly, substitution of the fourth AUG codon reduced translation by half using <italic>lacZ</italic> translational fusions. The second Met codon was absolutely required for <italic>pvuIIM</italic> translation initiation. The translation initiation region of <italic>pvuIIM</italic> has very limited similarity to canonical ribosome binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>), regardless of which translation initiator is analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). However the initiating ATG codon is followed by an AC sequence that can strongly enhance translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>). Importantly, the third Met codon (changed in O<sub>L</sub> intra-operator spacer mutants) is not at all involved in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>MTase activity was tested by <italic>in vivo</italic> titration, which revealed slightly reduced activity for the variant having two substitutions (N4S/S10R; due to the symmetrized C-box) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). This may contribute to less-efficient establishment of relevant PvuII R-M system variants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, these results suggest that, if both <italic>pvuIIM</italic> initiators are in fact used, the longer form of the MTase plays an important role in PvuII R-M system establishment (EOT for all symmetrized variants decreased to 30%, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), but not necessarily in maintenance (pIM20, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, clones producing only the shorter form of M.PvuII are unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). During R-M system introduction into a new host cell, MTase is expressed first, and endonuclease expression rises after a delay [about 8 min for PvuII, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>)]. One possibility is that the longer MTase form is produced first and provides greater initial protection activity, while later the shorter, more abundant MTase form acts as a maintenance MTase. This possibility deserves to be tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Higher relative affinity of C.PvuII for O<sub>L</sub></title><p>Even when the operator sequences themselves (GACTnnnAGTC) &#x02018;and&#x02019; their spacers are identical, there is still preferential C.PvuII binding to O<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). We used <italic>in vivo</italic> assays with four variants having identical copies of the two intra-operator spacers. The four spacer variants were TAT or CGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C) and CAT or CAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Normally, the level of <italic>pvuIICR</italic> transcription rises with the C.PvuII level due to autogenous activation, but repression results at higher levels of C.PvuII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). All four variants having identical spacers retained transcription profiles showing activation and subsequent repression, indicating formation of an O<sub>L</sub> complex prior to formation of the tetrameric O<sub>L</sub>&#x02013;O<sub>R</sub> repression complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). What explains this O<sub>L</sub> preference?</p><p>It has been proposed that competition with RNA polymerase reduces binding of C proteins to O<sub>R</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). While that may be a contributing factor <italic>in vivo</italic>, it cannot explain the O<sub>L</sub> dominance in the determination of net affinity that we observe <italic>in vitro</italic> (in the absence of RNAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). By inference, we might predict that flanking sequences and/or the central inter-operator sequence have an impact on C-protein regulation. There is weak conservation in the flanking sequences, except for the presence of TG/CA at the edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The C.Esp1396I tetramer co-crystal structure clearly shows direct interaction of conserved Arg35 from the recognition helix (<sup>H</sup>/<sub>D</sub><underline>R</underline>TY) of subunit A with the thymine base in TG, and an equivalent contact of subunit D with the symmetry-related TG on the opposite strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). However, this interaction appears to be symmetrical and it is not clear how it could explain the O<sub>L</sub> preference.</p><p>The central 4 nt (TGTA in the C.PvuII C-box) is the only clearly nonsymmetrical element. In the C.Esp1396I structure, there is a second-position contact to the inter-operator spacer in its C-box (C<underline>G</underline>TG), from the C protein Arg35 of subunit B. No equivalent contact is made on the opposite DNA face via subunit C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Again, however, this structure is of the tetrameric repression complex, and may not reflect the structure of the initial dimer&#x02013;O<sub>L</sub> complex. The basis for O<sub>L</sub> preference remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Modulatory role of the intra-operator spacers</title><p>The intra-operator spacers cannot by themselves explain the O<sub>L</sub> preference, but they may contribute to it. The analysis of 21 C-box regions from the C.PvuII subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) reveals that &#x0003c;10% of them have the same spacer sequence within both operators (Figure S1). We investigated the role of the spacers naturally occurring in the PvuII C-boxes: CAT in O<sub>L</sub> and CAA in O<sub>R</sub>, in the fully symmetrical C-box sequence context. We find that a single third position change in the O<sub>L</sub> spacer (CA<underline>T</underline>&#x02192;CA<underline>A</underline>) results in a &#x0223c;30% rise in net C.PvuII affinity, regardless of the O<sub>R</sub> spacer sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>Uncontacted DNA bases can still affect protein affinity. For example, operators O<sub>R</sub>1 and O<sub>R</sub>3 for repressor 434 differ by 3 nt, where two of them are within an uncontacted spacer yet substantially affect relative repressor affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). Detailed studies of 434 and P22 c2 repressors reveal that uncontacted bases at the center of binding sites are overwound, and the minor groove is substantially compressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65 B66 B67">65&#x02013;67</xref>). The TAT intra-operator spacers of C.Esp1396I are also associated with a much-narrowed minor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Compressibility of the 434 operator minor groove depends on the absence of purine N2-NH<sub>2</sub> groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). This might explain the rarity of guanosine in naturally occurring intra-operator spacers of C boxes [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>)] and much weaker binding of C.PvuII to the variant CGC intra-operator spacers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><p>The balance of operator affinities appears to affect temporal control of the R-M system. We observed viability problems for cells carrying a plasmid with CAA in O<sub>L</sub>, as indicated by strongly reduced plasmid transformability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We propose that this defect results from altered C.PvuII binding to its C-boxes and premature REase expression. Temporal control is critical during R-M system establishment in a new host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). We tested establishment of WT (O<sub>L</sub> spacer = CAT) and its variant (O<sub>L</sub> spacer = CAA) in new host cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). C protein appears to prematurely activate expression of a reporter gene downstream of the CAA O<sub>L</sub> variant relative to WT DNA. In a full R-M system, this could have lethal effects on the host cell.</p><p>Sensitivity to changes in spacer sequences may be a powerful evolutionary tool for fine-tuning regulatory circuits, because it expands the &#x02018;tunable&#x02019; sequence beyond just directly contacted sites. Further, the effects of sequence changes can be transmitted over 20 bp through a DNA-mediated allosteric &#x02018;domino effect&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>). The 434 phage repressor, which governs the lysogeny versus lysis decision, is sensitive to nucleotide variation in noncontacted spacers in its three operators. This repressor and others appear to detect DNA elastic potentials, so as to distinguish among operators without altering specific contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70 B71 B72">70&#x02013;72</xref>). For mobile, temporally regulated R-M systems, natural variation in such fine-tuning might be especially important for adaptation to a particular host's requirements, in controlling the potentially lethal endonuclease during R-M system establishment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>NOTE ADDED IN PROOF</title><p>After this manuscript was accepted, Sorokin <italic>et al.</italic> reported a detailed analysis of C boxes (73).
