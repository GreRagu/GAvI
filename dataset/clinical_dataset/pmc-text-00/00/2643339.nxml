The patient was a 38-year-old man, who was admitted to our hospital complaining of right upper quadrant pain caused by a toothpick that perforated the anterior gastric wall and penetrated segment I of the liver. After endoscopic removal and an initially uneventful course, computed tomography revealed a perigastric abscess that was treated by repeated gastroscopic rinsing via an endoscopically placed catheter. After another three uneventful weeks, a liver abscess with minor tendency to constrict the portal vein was diagnosed, and a segment I liver resection together with abscess drainage was performed.The peculiarity of this case is the rarity of toothpick ingestion and gastric perforation in a young and healthy white Caucasian followed by development of a liver abscess after primary uneventful endoscopic removal. In light of this case, gastric perforation due to ingested foreign bodies such as toothpicks can be considered a rare cause of upper abdominal pain.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="section" id="sec1"><title>1.

Case Report</title><p>A 38-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with athree-month history of upper abdominal pain. He complained of pain consistentwith gastritis, loss of appetite, and minor weight loss, but could not remembera particular situation or time when the pain first started. Gastroscopicfindings from a different institution were unremarkable. Abdominal examinationrevealed right upper quadrant pain with neither guarding nor rebound.</p><p>Laboratory examination showed a white cell count of 12 200 g/dL and a C-reactive protein of 9.69 g/dL. Sonography and computedtomography revealed a circular swelling of the anterior gastric wall up to 21 mmin diameter and an inflammatory process reaching into the liver, but did notidentify a foreign body.</p><p>To exclude the tentative radiologic diagnosis of an MALT lymphoma or agastric carcinoma, regastroscopy was performed.</p><p>This time a toothpick perforating the anterior gastricwall was detected that extended half of its length in the direction of theliver (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The toothpick was removed endoscopically using a grasperfor extricating foreign bodies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The esophagus was unremarkable.</p><p>After this procedure, the patient experiencedimmediate pain relief and his course was uneventful thereafter. Controlgastroscopy performed 24 hours after removal of the toothpick was normal. Antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactamand high-dose therapy of pantoprazole were initiated. Abdominal X-ray wasunremarkable, and laboratory signs of inflammation decreased. Four days later,the patient was discharged.</p><p>Once the diagnosis was established, a secondevaluation of the CT scan revealed a pattern possibly characteristic of atoothpick (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>After discharge, the patient was closely monitored in outpatientcheck-ups. Antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime was maintained for one more week,and the patient's course was uneventful for two weeks.</p><p>Thereafter,the patient again presented with right upper quadrant pain, and laboratoryfindings indicated severe inflammation. Computed tomography revealed aperigastric abscess that was successfully treated by gastroscopic rinsing. Acatheter was endoscopically inserted in the perigastric abscess several times,and through this catheter we rinsed the abscess cavity every time the catheterwas introduced. Since this was a unique case, the method was experimental. Treatment of such an abscess using antibiotics alone would have beenineffective. Before finally deciding to operate, we wanted to try gastroscopicrinsing, because it would be much less invasive than an operation and thelocation of the abscess was optimal for such treatment.</p><p>After gastroscopic rinsing,the patient was symptom free and showed no signs of inflammation. Moreover,computed tomography was unremarkable, so that we could reasonably presume atthat time that treatment was successful.</p><p>After another three uneventful weeks, the patient wasadmitted again. Once more he complained of right upper quadrant pain, and thistime laboratory findings showed leukocytosis to be 18 000 g/dL and C-reactiveprotein 60 g/dL. Blood cultures remained sterile. Computed tomography revealeda liver abscess mainly in the lobus caudatus with a slight tendency toconstrict the portal vein. The abscess was riddled with septa, so that puncturewas not possible. Antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated again, andan operative abscess drainage and segment I resection through laparotomyfinally performed. The abscess was 6 cm in diameter, and anatomical resection ofthe entire caudate lobe was necessary. The microbiological findings revealed <italic>Streptococcus milleri</italic> for the abscess material. The intraoperatively placed drain was left in placefor five days. The patient's subsequent course was uneventful, and he wasdischarged symptom free after two more weeks. The patient has remained symptom freeuntil today.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec3"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>As described in the literature, the majority offoreign bodies transit through the gastrointestinal system without causingcomplications. The esophagus and the colon are the two main localizations at thehighest risk for perforation. The literature contains only few reports ofperforation of the gastric wall, usually involving peritonitis that issubsequently treated by laparoscopy or laparotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>From this case, we see that the initially benigncourse of a gastric perforation due to a toothpick can ultimately become aseverely dangerous situation, as when our patient developed a liver abscess. Ifsuch an abscess cannot be drained percutaneously because of septa or adverselocalization, immediate surgical removal is mandatory to prevent alife-threatening situation like a portal vein thrombosis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Maleki</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>WE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Foreign-body perforation of the intestinal tract.
