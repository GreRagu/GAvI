Although most of our knowledge stems from closely monitored clinical drug trials, the understanding of why a majority of attempts to stop smoking fail, is incomplete.</p><p>One factor that may explain a failed quit attempt is the smoker's experience of nicotine withdrawal. Early relapsing smokers are thought to be more severely dependent, and smokers unable to stay quit have reported more severe withdrawal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Although studies have focused on different symptoms and varying definitions of severity, they are generally consistent with the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and the Statistical Manual definition of nicotine withdrawal DSM-IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Nicotine withdrawal includes symptoms of anxiety/apprehension, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depression/depressed mood, irritability, sleepiness/drowsiness, and insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Despite omission from the DSM-IV, craving is also a cardinal feature of sudden abstinence from nicotine use.</p><p>We hypothesise that respondents who are failed quitters in a telephone quitline report more severe symptoms compared with subjects who succeed in stopping smoking. This should hold even after controlling for potential confounders including age, gender, and use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). We also hypothesise that depression/depressed mood may be associated with failure to remain abstinent. The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence and intensity of different symptoms in relation to tobacco abstinence in a group of quitters calling a quitline. We also try to explore if there is a correlation between the different symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study population and setting</title><p>The study is based on a 12-month follow-up comprising all 1131 smokers who had called the Swedish quitline and signed up for smoking cessation treatment from February 2000 to November 2001. A total of 741 people (66%) reporting to have been abstinent for a minimum of 24 hours to a theoretical maximum of 12 months during the follow-up period were included in the study base. The same study population was used for all analyses.</p><p>The Swedish quitline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] is a nationwide free of charge service that operates 51 hours per week through three to four telephone lines. All calls are registered on computerised patient records. All callers signing up for smoking cessation support by returning a registration form by mail are included.</p><p>Self reported point prevalence abstinence at 12 months was defined as "not a single puff of smoke during the last week".</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>A questionnaire identifying 17 symptoms was sent by mail to all subjects 12&#x02013;13 months after first contact with the quitline. Assessed symptoms are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and nine correspond to the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual for Mental Disorders DSM-III-R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]/DSM &#x02013; IV criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Increased appetite and weight gain were excluded because of the narrow time window used. Physiological symptoms not included in the DSM comprised nightmares, dizziness, mouth ulcers, sweating, muscular pain, cramps, constipation and other stomach trouble.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Frequency and intensity of reported symptoms in smokers abstaining from tobacco at least 24 hours.

Pharmacological treatment included: chewing gum, transdermal nicotine patch, inhaler, nasal spray or tablets.</p><p>Ethical approval was obtained by Karolinska Institutet (Dnr 00-367).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods and presentation of data</title><p>Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence interval. To analyse the relationship between symptoms and abstinence we dichotomised the response alternatives (none, low, moderate, and high) into low and high intensity. This was done so that for each variable, the two categories became as equally sized as possible. The cut-offs for the assessment of NRT use were "less than 5 weeks", "5 weeks or more", or "not at all". NRT was also assessed as "NRT" vs. "no NRT use". Significance levels for all tests were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social sciences (SPSS 12.1).</p><p>A factor analysis approach where individual items aggregate into factors was used to explore the relationship between the different symptoms. Firstly, a principal component analysis was conducted to explore the correlation between the 17 symptoms. Secondly, varimax orthogonal rotation was done to simplify the interpretation of the factors by maximising the variance of the loadings within factors, across variables. It was decided a priori that the number of factors in the varimax rotation should be based on the number of Eigenvalues &#x02265; 1,0 in the principal component analysis and Cattell's scree test was performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Factor loadings greater than 0.35 was a priori considered to be of importance when interpreting the factors.</p><p>A factor loading matrix is created were correlations between factors and variable are presented. The first column is correlations between the first factor and each variable in turn. The second column is correlations between the second factor and each variable in turn and goes on the same way for the third factor. A factor is interpreted from the variables that are highly correlated with it &#x02013; that have high loadings on it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>To assess the relationship between factors and abstinence, factor scores were calculated using the regression method and t-test was performed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Prevalence of symptoms</title><p>Of the 1131 subjects who agreed to participate in the study, 66% (741/1131) reported to have been smoke free for at least 24 hours.

The symptoms that were most frequently reported (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were the symptoms comprising what we labelled as the psychological factor. All symptoms comprising the psychological factor were statistically related to point prevalence abstinence at 12 months, with those reporting low intensity of the symptoms being more likely to report abstinence.</p><sec><title>Symptoms and abstinence</title><p>All symptoms comprising the psychological factor were negatively related to point prevalence abstinence at 12 months. This factor comprised largely the same symptoms that have previously been highlighted in the assessment of tobacco cessation in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and related to abstinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Three prospective studies have reported depression/depressed mood as being predictive of unsuccessful smoking cessation and relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This is in line with our results where having depression/depressed mood as a symptom proved to be associated with failure to remain abstinent. Also in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> having high intensity of depression/depressed mood related negatively to abstinence. (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>In our study, only two symptoms not belonging to the psychological factor, were related to abstinence: insomnia and mouth ulcers. Insomnia included in the neurological factor (factor 3) in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> was one of three symptoms assessing sleeping disorders that comprised half of the symptoms in this factor. Studies of nicotine withdrawal have consistently found sleep disturbance to be a common complaint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and since three of the symptoms insomnia, sleepiness/drowsiness and nightmares related to sleep disturbance and had relatively high factor loadings we might have a latent dimension of sleeping disorders in factor 3.</p><p>The other symptom not belonging to the psychological factor, and significantly related to abstinence was mouth ulcers, belonging to the physiological factor (factor 2) in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. In this case the relationship was reverse. Subjects reporting mouth ulcers were more likely to be abstinent. This might be explained by the fact that NRT use was positively related to mouth ulcers. In our study, high intensity of mouth ulcers was reported by 7%. Another study found that 8% reported severe mouth ulcers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] in relation to smoking cessation.</p><p>It has been reported that one in ten patients has severe problems with constipation in relation to smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This was confirmed in our results.</p></sec><sec><title>Symptoms and NRT</title><p>All psychological symptoms appeared to be associated with NRT use. People using NRT for less then 5 weeks reported a higher prevalence of these symptoms compared with individuals not using NRT and those who used NRT for 5 weeks or longer.</p><p>It would be expected that people experiencing low intensity of these symptoms would be less prone to use NRT. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> illustrates that people using NRT to ease psychological symptoms need taking higher doses to achieve results. These findings are in line with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and present recommendations regarding NRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. There was a significant increase of mouth ulcers in NRT users compared with non-users. One hypothesis is that this may be due to a changed balance in oral microbial flora secondary to the toxic effect of nicotine.</p></sec><sec><title>NRT and abstinence</title><p>The hypothesis that nicotine withdrawal may be an important reason why individuals persist in their smoking behaviour and are relatively unsuccessful in their smoking cessation attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] is supported by our results. That can be seen by the relationship between low prevalence of symptoms comprising the psychological factor, increased abstinence and the suppressing effect of NRT use for 5 weeks or longer on these symptoms.</p><p>However, the relationship between nicotine withdrawal and unsuccessful smoking cessation has been ambiguous in previous reviews of the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. One reason for this unclear relationship may be insufficient control for psychological and environmental factors strongly related to abstinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These psychological and environmental factors will delude the relationship between nicotine dependency and successful cessation if not controlled for. Also, the assessment of dependence usually comprises questionnaires that should at best be viewed as indicators of dependence and are by no means objective measures of a physiological phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. There is a possibility of unidentified physiological factors of dependence in tobacco that may partly be responsible for the diffuse relationship between nicotine withdrawal and unsuccessful smoking cessation. However, such a hypothesis is highly speculative. However, the risk of experiencing nicotine withdrawal after a quit attempt is known to be partly related to genetic vulnerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Gender has been reported to influence withdrawal discomfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, other studies, including ours, found no differences in overall withdrawal severity between men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Methodological limitations</title><p>The present study assesses a population of smokers having called a quitline for smoking cessation support. We do not know if those not participating in the follow-up (30%) had more withdrawal symptoms. However, in a previously published study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] we assessed the behaviour of non-responders by using telephone interviews with a sample of people not participating in the 12 months follow-up. No significant difference regarding abstinence rates between responders and non-responders was found in our material.</p><p>Another possible source of error includes the use of single item measures of symptoms, rating each symptom on a four point prevalence intensity scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. An alternative would have been to use validated psychometric scales to assess the prevalence and intensity of symptoms like anxiety and depression/depressed mood. This was not deemed practical in the quitline setting due to the large number of patients.</p><p>As most smokers report multiple quit attempts before they succeed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] it is plausible that individuals eventually learn to endure the symptoms of withdrawal. Thus, the reported symptoms (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) may be an underestimation. Also, coping strategies such as relaxation or seeking social support which may have been achieved through the quitline counsellors, may have moderated symptom stress. Another caveat in a retrospective study is recall bias.</p><p>The questionnaire used by the Swedish quitline at the time assessed withdrawal symptoms only among smokers who had made a serious attempt to quit and had been totally tobacco free for at least 24 hours. Thus, comparing symptoms between smokers not attempting to quit and those who were at least temporary successful (24 hours or more) was not possible. Further, we do not know the prevalence and intensity of the assessed symptoms in the general population of non smokers. Thus, baseline data on the prevalence of the symptoms was not available which is a problem for the presentation of symptom prevalence in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. However, this is probably not a major problem for the analysis of the relationship between symptoms and to what extent the reported symptoms were related to the 12 months abstinence rate.</p><p>It has been argued that a quit attempt that lasted a week or longer in the last year appears less biased by recall than any attempt of a day or longer in the last year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, the 24 hour time frame of abstinence used for symptom assessment was selected to achieve better statistical power in the analysis. It may be argued that the 24 hour time window is too narrow but we argue that this is justifiable since there was no significant difference detected regarding prevalence of symptoms in the 24 hour group when compared with people reporting longer abstinence (seven days, two and 6 months). It was noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] that self-report ratings of behaviours and internal states becomes less valid when participants are asked to rate them over a substantial period of time (i.e. 2&#x02013;4 weeks) rather than a shorter time period (i.e. within the past 24 hrs.).</p><p>Unfortunately only abstinent subjects were examined since the question only addressed those being abstinent for at least 24 h. This may have understated symptom severity.</p><p>NRT was measured only with a question assessing duration of treatment and the cut-offs were less than 5 weeks, 5 weeks or more, or not at all. There was no measure of the intensity of the NRT treatment during the assessed time frame. This is likely to reduce the sensitivity of assessment of the impact NRT may have on the severity of the symptoms.</p><p>Although the 17 symptoms measured here fell almost cleanly into three distinct groupings, this does not mean that there are only three factors of symptoms related to tobacco withdrawal. There may be other factors not captured by these 17 items. Additional studies need to be done to further explore the mechanisms that produce the three factors observed in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that high prevalence of symptoms comprising the psychological factor relate to unsuccessful quitting attempts in a population-based setting. NRT appeared to have a positive effect on relieving these symptoms when used for five weeks or more.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><name><surname>Higgins</surname><given-names>ST</given-names></name><name><surname>Hatsukami</surname><given-names>DK</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Koslowski LT, Anis H, Capell HD, Glaser F, Goodstadt M, Israel Y, Kalant H, Sellers EM, Vingilis J</surname></name></person-group><article-title>Effects of abstinence from tobacco: A critical review</article-title><source>Research advances in alcohol &#x00026; drug problems</source><year>1990</year><volume>10</volume><publisher-name>New York: Plenum Press</publisher-name><fpage>317</fpage><lpage>398</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kottke</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Brekke</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Solberg</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A randomized trial to increase smoking intervention by physicians.
