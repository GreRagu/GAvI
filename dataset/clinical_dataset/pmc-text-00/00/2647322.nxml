The steps of both spliceosome assembly and splicing reaction have been extensively analyzed, and many of the factors involved have been identified. However, the post-splicing intron turnover process, especially in vertebrates, remains to be examined. In this paper, we developed a two-tag affinity purification method for purifying lariat intron RNA&#x02013;protein complexes obtained from an <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reaction. Glycerol gradient sedimentation analyses revealed that there are at least two forms of post-splicing intron complexes, which we named the &#x02018;Intron Large (IL)&#x02019; and the &#x02018;Intron Small (IS)&#x02019; complexes. The IL complex contains U2, U5 and U6 snRNAs and other protein splicing factors, whereas the IS complex contains no such U snRNAs or proteins. We also showed that TFIP11, a human homolog of yeast Ntr1, is present in the IL complex and the TFIP11 mutant protein, which lacks the interaction domain with hPrp43 protein, caused accumulation of the IL complex and reduction of IS complex formation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that TFIP11 in cooperation with hPrp43 mediates the transition from the IL complex to the IS complex, leading to efficient debranching and turnover of excised introns.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nuclear pre-mRNA splicing takes place in a large RNA&#x02013;protein complex (RNP) that is termed &#x02018;spliceosome&#x02019;. Spliceosome is composed of U1, U2, U4/U6 and U5 snRNPs and a large number of non-snRNP proteinaceous splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Spliceosome assembly has been extensively analyzed by <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing systems using extracts from HeLa and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In both systems, spliceosome formation proceeds by a sequential assembly of several intermediate complexes. In mammals the intermediate complexes are termed H, E, A, B, B* and C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>In the first step, the naked pre-mRNA associates with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which are abundant nuclear RNA-binding proteins, to form the H complex. Then, U1 snRNP recognizes and binds to a conserved 5&#x02032; splice site in an ATP-independent manner to give the E complex. Subsequently, U2 snRNP stably binds to a branch point sequence in an ATP-dependent manner forming the A complex. Then, preformed tri-snRNP (U4/U6 and U5) joins the A complex giving rise to the B complex. Subsequently, the B complex is activated through RNP rearrangements leading to the displacement or destabilization of U1 and U4 snRNPs from the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The resultant B* spliceosome, which is also called the activated spliceosome, catalyzes the first step reaction, during which the branch-point adenosine attacks the 5&#x02032; splice site, generating a cleaved 5&#x02032; exon and intron&#x02013;3&#x02032; exon lariat intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). As a result of the above reaction, the C1 complex is formed and mediates catalysis of the second step of splicing via ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). This results in the formation of the C2 complex, which contains ligated exons and excised lariat introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). C1 and C2 complexes are often collectively called the &#x02018;C complex&#x02019;.</p><p>In addition to U snRNAs and their specific proteins, a large number of non-snRNP proteins are associated with spliceosome and play essential roles in splicing. In order to learn about the dynamics of the spliceosome's proteome, mass spectrometric (MS) studies of the spliceosomal complexes isolated at defined stages have been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The complexes analyzed to date include the H, A, B&#x00394;U1 (B complex lacking U1 snRNP), B, B* and C1 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">7&#x02013;12</xref>). The most recent work by Bessonov <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) describes the purification and characterization of fully assembled, active spliceosome C1 complexes that contain the products of the first step of splicing and are capable of carrying out the second-step reaction (exon ligation) without additional protein factors. From these MS analyses, over 100 splicing factors have been identified, and their dynamic association and dissociation during spliceosome formation have been uncovered.</p><p>Compared to the extensive analysis of the steps and factors of spliceosome formation, little is known about the post-splicing pathway. Only a few factors involved in the post-splicing process have been identified, almost exclusively by analyses of budding yeast mutants. Upon the completion of the splicing reaction, the spliced RNA (mRNA) is released from the spliceosome, and the remaining post-splicing RNPs containing the lariat intron are disassembled in an active process involving two members of the ATP-dependent DExH box RNA helicase family, Prp22 and Prp43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Prp22 is needed for the release of the spliced RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), while Prp43 is necessary for the disassembly of the remaining intron-containing RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Recently it has been shown that two splicing factors, Ntr1 and Ntr2, in the form of a stable dimmer, associate with Prp43. The resultant trimeric complex is termed the &#x02018;NTR complex&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Ntr1 contains a G-patch domain at its N-terminal region, which is responsible for its interaction with Prp43, and this interaction stimulates Prp43&#x02032;s helicase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The NTR complex is functional in catalyzing the disassembly of the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). After dissociation of U snRNPs and other splicing factors from the lariat intron, the intron is linearized by a lariat intron debranching enzyme, DBR1, before being degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>In humans, most of the genes encoded in the nucleus contain multiple introns, which occupy 95% of the protein-coding primary transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). These introns are excised from pre-mRNAs by splicing as a lariat form and get degraded in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). If the excised introns are not processed properly in the nucleus, the splicing factors become trapped on the excised introns and the splicing reaction is negatively affected. The inhibition of intron degradation into mononucleotides might cause a reduction in the amount of free nucleotides, which could result in transcription defects. Moreover, in vertebrates, guide small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), which mediate ribosomal RNAs modifications, are encoded in the introns of some genes. These snoRNAs are known to be processed from the excised introns in coordination with the splicing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The loss of functional snoRNAs leads to production of unmodified rRNAs, which reduces ribosome processivity. Therefore, it is likely that the postsplicing intron turnover process is extremely important in vertebrates.</p><p>Although no study has focused on the post-splicing intron turnover process in mammals, the homologs of the factors described above in yeast have been identified in mammals. HRH1 (Human RNA Helicases 1), a human homolog of yeast Prp22 protein, mediates the release of spliced mRNA from the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Homologs of Prp43 have also been identified in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Moreover, human and mouse DBR1 proteins, which show a high sequence homology to the yeast protein, were demonstrated to complement the yeast dbr mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Recently it has been shown that human Ntr1 like protein, which is also called Tuftelin Interacting Protein 11 (TFIP11), interacts with factors involved in DNA double-strand break repair and telomere metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). However, the function of TFIP11 in splicing has not been investigated. To date, no human homologs of NTR2 have been reported.</p><p>In this report, we developed a purification system for excised intron RNPs obtained via <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reactions using two affinity tags. Glycerol gradient sedimentation experiments revealed that there are two different forms of post-splicing intron complexes. One is a 40S form with U2, U5 and U6 snRNPs, which was termed the &#x02018;IL (Intron Large) complex&#x02019;, and the other is a 20S form, which was termed the &#x02018;IS (Intron Small) complex&#x02019;. We investigated the protein composition of these complexes by MS and western blotting and found stable associations of several human Prp19 complex factors with the IL complex, but none with the IS complex. SF3a/3b proteins, which are 17S U2 snRNP associated factors, did not stably associate with the IL complex although U2 snRNA and its specific protein U2B&#x02032;&#x02032; were present in the complex. The IS complex contained none of the tested U snRNAs and protein factors.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that the TFIP11/hNtr1 protein is stably present in the IL complex and that it recruits the hPrp43 protein to the IL complex through interactions mediated by its N-terminal G-patch region. Overexpression of the mutant TFIP11 protein, which lacks the G-patch domain caused the accumulation of IL complex and a reduction in IS complex formation. We also demonstrated that the lariat intron in the IS complex is more susceptible to debranching reaction by hDBR1 than that in the IL complex. Our results strongly suggest that the hPrp43&#x02013;TFIP11 complex catalyzes the transition of the IL complex to the IS complex leading to efficient debranching and subsequent degradation of the lariat intron during the post-splicing intron turnover process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>For the construction of the p&#x003b4;-crystallin MS2 plasmid, a DNA fragment containing three copies of the MS2 binding site was generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) although we attached SacI sites at both ends of the fragment. One copy of this fragment was inserted into the SacI site between the 5&#x02032; splice site and the branch adenosine of the pSP14-15 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). For the construction of the pAd2-MS2 plasmid, three copies of the DNA fragment that contained the SacII site at both ends were inserted into the SacII site of the pAd2 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).

The 5&#x02032;exon RNA should also be precipitated with the beads through its interaction with the lariat intermediate in the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Therefore, only the lariat intron that had been released from the spliceosome was anticipated to be in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The intron complex in the supernatant was further purified by a pull-down assay with glutathione beads.<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Purification of the post-splicing intron complex from an <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reaction.

However, U1 cannot be a general component of the IS complex since U1 snRNA was not detected in the IS complex when we employed the AdML-MS2 pre-mRNA substrate (Figure S1). Taken together, these results indicate that there were at least two different post-splicing intron complexes in the released supernatant fraction. The heavier IL complex is about 40S and contains U2, U5 and U6 snRNAs, whereas the smaller IS complex is about 20S and is free of spliceosomal U snRNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of protein factors in the lariat&#x02013;intron RNPs</title><p>To obtain information regarding the protein composition of the human intron complexes, proteins in the affinity-purified intron complex fraction were separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, &#x02018;lariat&#x02019; lane). Note that the glycerol gradient separation procedure was not employed in this experiment. As a control, gel-purified linear intron RNA was incubated with HeLa nuclear extracts, and the identical affinity selection procedures were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, &#x02018;control&#x02019; lane). By using this control RNA, we should be able to recognize proteins that bind to the intronic RNA sequence without splicing reaction. Proteins that bind to the lariat&#x02013;intron through splicing reaction would be anticipated to be enriched in the lariat&#x02013;intron complex as compared to the linear-intron complex. The protein bands that appeared to be enriched in the &#x02018;lariat&#x02019; lane were excised from the gel and analyzed by MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Several splicing factors, such as U2 and U5 snRNP specific proteins (SF3b130, U5-116K), hPrp19 complex proteins (IBP160, Xab2, and hPrp19), hPrp43 and some hnRNP proteins (hnRNP A2/B1, I and U) as well as other proteins, were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A).

Subsequently, affinity selection by glutathione beads was performed for each glycerol gradient fraction, and the affinity-selected fractions were used for the western blotting analyses. The results indicate that hPrp19 complex proteins such as hPrp19, Xab2 and IBP160 are present in the IL complex. U5 snRNP specific proteins such as U5-220k and U5-116k, and U2 snRNP core protein U2B&#x02032;&#x02032; were also found in the IL complex fraction. This is consistent with the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, which shows the presence of U2 and U5 snRNAs in the IL complex. On the other hand, no components of the SF3a/3b complex were stably detected in the IL complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, SF3b155 and 130, SF3a120 and 60), although SF3b130 was identified by MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). This suggests that the SF3a/3b complex has dissociated prior to IL complex formation (see &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section). TFIP11 was also detected in the IL complex but not in the IS complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B and Figure S1B). However, the signals of hPrp43 near the IL and IS fractions and of SF3b155 and SF3b130 near the IS fraction were also observed in the control fractions, in which the same procedures were performed in the absence of tagged pre-mRNA (data not shown, see also Figure S1C). Thus, these signals could represent contamination of endogenous complexes unrelated to the IL and IS complexes. It should be pointed out, however, that hPrp43 was detected by the MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). hPrp43 interacts with TFIP11 and is likely to be targeted transiently at the IL complex as will be shown and discussed later. The hDBR1 protein, which catalyzes the debranching reaction of the lariat intron, was not detected in either complex. These results demonstrate that many of the proteins identified by MS analysis of the lariat&#x02013;intron complex are associated with the IL complex, whereas the IS complex does not contain any of the spliceosomal U snRNAs or protein factors tested so far.</p></sec><sec><title>TFIP11 protein binds specifically to hPrp43 protein and mediates the disassembly of intron RNP in cooperation with hPrp43 protein</title><p>TFIP11, which was identified by MS analysis of the intron complex, was found both in the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and in the IL complex (this study, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Since this protein shares relatively high homology (22% identity) with yeast Ntr1 protein and was shown to be able to complement the yeast &#x00394;ntr1 mutant strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), TFIP11 is considered to be a human homolog of yeast Ntr1. The Ntr1 protein associates with Prp43 protein and mediates the disassembly of lariat&#x02013;intron RNP into U snRNPs and the lariat intron in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Therefore using a co-immunoprecipitation experiment, we tested if TFIP11 binds specifically to hPrp43. We transiently expressed Flag-tagged TFIP11 in HEK293T cells and carried out immunoprecipitations with anti-Flag antibody from the whole-cell lysates of the transfected cells. Endogenous hPrp43 protein was efficiently co-precipitated with Flag-TFIP11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lane 4). This co-precipitation was not affected by the presence of RNase A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, lane 5), suggesting that TFIP11 and hPrp43 interact with each other through protein&#x02013;protein interactions. In yeast cells, Ntr1 interacts with Prp43 through one of its domains called a G-patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Since TFIP11 also has a G-patch domain at its amino-terminal region, we next sought to determine whether the G-patch domain of TFIP11 is involved in the interaction with hPrp43. We carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays with histidine (His)-tagged recombinant hPrp43 and [<sup>35</sup><italic>S</italic>]methionine-labeled, <italic>in vitro</italic> translated TFIP11 wild-type and mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The TFIP11 wild type bound efficiently to hPrp43 but not to the control protein His-GST (lanes 1&#x02013;3). When the first 50 amino acids of TFIP11, which correspond to the first half of the G-patch domain, were deleted, the resultant mutant protein, termed TFIP11&#x00394;N, was no longer able to bind to hPrp43 (lanes 4&#x02013;6). These results strongly suggest that TFIP11 interacts with hPrp43 through the G-patch domain.In analogy with the yeast system, it was plausible to hypothesize that TFIP11 mediates dissociation of U snRNPs and other proteins from the IL complex through its binding to hPrp43, prior to debranching of the lariat intron. To test this hypothesis, we used the TFIP11&#x00394;N protein, which lacks hPrp43-binding domain, since we could expect that it would act as a dominant negative protein. Wild-type or &#x00394;N mutant of TFIP11 was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells by transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Nuclear extracts were prepared from the transfected cells, and <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing was performed using those extracts with &#x003b4;-crystallin pre-mRNA as a substrate. When the extract from Flag-TFIP11-expressing HEK293T cells was used, the lariat intron product was most abundantly found in glycerol gradient fractions 4 and 5,which corresponded to the IS complex, but was less present in fractions 8 and 9, which corresponded to the IL complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, left panel). In contrast, when the nuclear extract from the HEK293T cells that expressed Flag-TFIP11&#x00394;N was used, the lariat intron product in the IS fractions was reduced and that in the IL fractions was increased, suggesting that the IL complex is a precursor of the IS complex and that the transition from IL to IS complexes is slow in this extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, compare the right and left panels). We also carried out immunoprecipitation assays with anti-Flag tag antibody using the fractionated IL containing complex to examine the association of Flag-tagged TFIP11 proteins with lariat RNA. The results showed that both TFIP11&#x00394;N and the wild-type TFIP11 proteins could co-precipitate with the lariat intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, lanes 8 and 12, and 5D for quantification). We also used anti-hPrp43 antibody for immunoprecipitation experiments and found that the precipitation efficiency of lariat intron RNA from TFIP11&#x00394;N expressing extract was reproducibly lower than that from the wild-type TFIP11 expressing extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, lanes 7 and 11, and 5D for quantification), suggesting that hPrp43 is recruited to the intron complex through its interaction with the G-patch domain of TFIP11. These results, taken together, strongly suggest that the TFIP11 protein, in cooperation with hPrp43, mediates the disassembly of the IL complex into IS complex.<fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>The TFIP11 protein binds to hPrp43 through its amino-terminus.

It was expected that the lariat intron in the IS complex would be more susceptible to the debranching reaction than that in the IL complex, since U snRNPs and many proteins had already been removed. To test this hypothesis, we carried out an <italic>in vitro</italic> debranching assay with the two intron complex fractions. For this assay, recombinant Flag-hDBR1 proteins were expressed in HEK293T cells and purified through an anti-Flag M2 antibody column. In addition to the wild-type protein, a mutant hDBR1 protein, which had a substitution at amino-acid residue 84 from asparagine to alanine (N84A), was also prepared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). The equivalent mutation in yeast Dbr1 protein had already been demonstrated to cause the loss of debranching activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). When the recombinant wild-type hDBR1 protein was incubated with the intron RNPs immobilized on glutathione beads that were recovered from the supernatant of streptavidin agarose precipitation as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, lane 4, a fraction of the lariat intron was debranched and linearized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 3). On the other hand, neither the mock-purified hDBR1 fraction nor the N84A mutant could cause the debranching of the lariat intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 2 and 4). These results indicate that the recombinant Flag-hDBR1 protein has a debranching activity and that the point mutation at N 84 to A caused the loss of this activity. When affinity purified IL and IS complexes on glutathione beads were incubated with the hDBR1 proteins, the lariat intron in the IS complex was efficiently debranched only by the wild-type hDBR1, while the intron in the IL was quite resistant to debranching by the wild-type hDBR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, compare lanes 7 and 11). These results demonstrate that the lariat intron in the IS complex, which contains less factors, is more accessible to hDBR1 for its debranching activity. In the IL complex, it is likely that U snRNPs and other proteins identified by MS protect the branch point region of the lariat intron from hDBR1. In summary, our results strongly suggest that the IL and IS complexes are intermediate complexes of post-splicing intron degradation and that the TFIP11&#x02013;hPrp43 complex mediates the transition of the IL complex to the IS complex before the debranching reaction by hDBR1.<fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><italic>In vitro</italic> debranching assays of the lariat introns from IS and IL complex.

By combining the purification method with glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis, we have found that the excised lariat intron is present in at least two different forms, namely IL (&#x0223c;40S) and IS (&#x0223c;20S) complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The IL complex contains, besides the excised lariat intron, U2, U5 and U6 snRNPs and many protein factors including hPrp19 complex proteins (hPrp19, Xab2, IBP160) and TFIP11, while the IS complex contains no such U snRNPs or proteins. Our results also suggest that the IL complex is a precursor of the IS complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Thus, during the transition from the IL to the IS complexes, all three spliceosomal U snRNAs and many protein factors are dissociated from the IL complex. It is likely from our results that a complex containing TFIP11 and hPrp43 mediates this dissociation. However, how this dissociation process is achieved is not known.</p><p>It was reported that U5 snRNP is subjected to drastic remodeling during spliceosome activation and is possibly released after splicing as a form of 35S U5 snRNP containing hPrp19 complex proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Our IL complex contained both U5 snRNA and hPrp19 complex proteins. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that U5 snRNP is released from the IL complex as a form of 35S U5 snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The released 35S U5 snRNP is then converted to 20S U5 snRNP for the next round splicing reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).<fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>A model for the intron turnover pathway after splicing in the nucleus.

Our result that SF3a/3b proteins are not stable constituents of the IL complex is consistent with this paper. Taken together, we believe that U2 snRNP is released from the IL complex as a form of 12S U2 snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>While a complex containing TFIP11 and hPrp43 is likely to mediate the IL complex disassembly, our results also suggest that TFIP11 is a stable constituent of the IL complex. However, hPrp43 had a peak in #9 fraction, whereas TFIP11 mainly existed in #8 fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Thus, it is likely that hPrp43 is not a stable constituent of IL complex and targets the IL complex only transiently for the disassembly of the IL complex. This targeting is probably mediated by its interaction with the G-patch domain of TFIP11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). TFIP11 protein thus acts as a scaffold that recruits hPrp43 protein to the IL complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). However, the hPrp43 protein is reported to be associated with the B spliceosome as a part of 17S U2 snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Thus, hPrp43 is thought to be released sometime between the B and IL complexes. When hPrp43 targets the IL complex for disassembly, it has to utilize a different targeting system (TFIP11) since U2 snRNP is no longer in its 17S form in the IL complex. Why such a complicated targeting system is employed is currently unknown. The resultant IS complex serves as an efficient substrate for hDBR1 leading to a complete degradation of the intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>In comparison to the abundant information about the IL complex in this study, the nature of the IS complex is not well known. In yeast, Ntr1 forms a heterodimer with Ntr2 and functions as a trimer with Prp43 for the disassembly of the post-splicing complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). The resultant disassembled product is thought to be free lariat intron RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). In our case, however, we do not think that the IS complex is devoid of all factors, although it is devoid of all the splicing factors tested in this study. The IS complex migrated as 20S, which is clearly different from the gel-purified free lariat intron (data not shown). It should also be pointed out that no human homolog of Ntr2 has been identified to date. It is still not clear whether humans have a counterpart of yeast Ntr2. A co-immunoprecipitation experiment with TFIP11 may enable us to identify the candidates for human Ntr2.</p><p>In this study, we have focused on the post-splicing complexes of general introns. It is of interest to apply our purification strategy to the isolation of post-splicing complexes of particular introns that harbor noncoding RNAs, such as snoRNAs and microRNAs. Of these noncoding RNAs, snoRNAs are known to be produced in coordination with the splicing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Future experiments with these specified pre-mRNAs would help us to gain a comprehensive understanding of post-splicing intron turnover in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1002/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>CREST (to M.O.); JST; grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan; the 21st Century COE Program of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (to R.Y.); and the Program for Improvement of Research Environment for Young Researchers from Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology (SCF) commissioned by the MEXT of Japan (to N.K.).
