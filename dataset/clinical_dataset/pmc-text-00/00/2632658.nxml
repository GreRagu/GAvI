Fluorescence microscopy using the DNA fluorochrome 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) reveals a condensed form of the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), the nucleoid, that varies in size, number, and location during early leaf development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Replication of cpDNA in meristematic cells leads to an increase during leaf development in the amount of cpDNA per chloroplast and per leaf cell and the fraction of total cellular DNA present as cpDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For Arabidopsis, the number of genomes per plastid in the first leaf increases about 15-fold (from ~40 to 600) during the period from 3 to 7 days after germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As leaf cells expand and mature, the amount of cpDNA declines in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] (We made an error in the Abstract of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] when we stated that the decline in cpDNA amount proceeds "until most of the leaves contain little or no DNA". The decline in cpDNA amount proceeds until most of the chloroplasts contain little or no detectable DNA), barley, spinach, pea, rice, maize, <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>, and tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The reduction in cpDNA has been attributed to either cpDNA degradation and/or to dilution of a constant amount of cpDNA by chloroplast division following the cessation of cpDNA replication, depending on the species.</p><p>Recent studies report a constant amount of cpDNA during leaf development in Arabidopsis and tobacco, as determined by blot-hybridization of restriction-digested DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and also by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These authors proposed that the decline in DNA per plastid observed for Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] resulted from an artifact associated with the isolation of plastids before quantification of cpDNA. If the amount of DNA per chloroplast were actually constant during this period of leaf expansion, then Arabidopsis and tobacco would be atypical among the plants for which such data have been reported, and would not serve as good models for certain aspects of chloroplast development. Thus, it seemed necessary to revisit this contentious issue.</p><p>We previously reported that the amount of DNA per chloroplast declined only during the expansion of older (but not young) leaves in tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We concluded that tobacco exhibited the greatest degree of cpDNA preservation during leaf development among the eight plants investigated. In the present study, we assess the amount and molecular integrity of cpDNA for Arabidopsis by several methods: DAPI-staining of leaf sections as well as individual isolated chloroplasts, qPCR with DNA prepared from total tissue as well as from isolated chloroplasts, fluorescence microscopy of ethidium-stained DNA molecules prepared in gel from isolated plastids, and blot-hybridization of restriction-digested total tissue DNA. With each of these methods, we find a reduction during development in the amount of DNA per chloroplast and the fraction of cellular DNA represented by cpDNA. This reduction cannot be attributed solely to DNA dilution caused by chloroplast division. Since the data demonstrate that the loss of DNA from plastids during leaf development does not result from an artifact of plastid isolation, we conclude that DNA is degraded <italic>in vivo </italic>as Arabidopsis plastids mature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Decline in cpDNA content is not an artifact of chloroplast isolation</title><p>To test whether the isolation process affects the amount of cpDNA present in Arabidopsis chloroplasts, hand sections of leaves were prepared and immediately fixed with glutaraldehyde. The sections were then stained with DAPI and observed using fluorescence microscopy. Nucleoids were clearly visible in chloroplasts of the 9-day-old first rosette leaf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref>), which was 20% of its maximum length. However, chloroplasts of the mature, fully expanded first rosette leaf at 31 days post germination (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D&#x02013;F</xref>) and the yellowing 45-day-old senescent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G&#x02013;I</xref>) rosette leaf rarely had clearly visible nucleoids and often had no observable DAPI-DNA fluorescence. Most (72%) of the chloroplasts of the young rosette leaf exhibited strong DAPI-DNA staining, compared with only 0.5% of those of mature leaves and none of the chloroplasts of the senescent rosette leaf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Accordingly, the percentage of chloroplasts exhibiting weak and no DAPI-DNA fluorescence was much higher for the mature rosette leaf (45.5% and 54%, respectively) than the young rosette leaf (27% and 2%). The proportion of chloroplasts exhibiting weak (32%) and no DAPI-DNA fluorescence (68%) for the senescent rosette leaf indicates a slight decline in cpDNA content as mature leaves senesce.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>DAPI-DNA staining of cytological sections for rosette leaves</bold>.

We previously observed that complex forms were generally present in younger leaves of Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and absent from older leaves. It is possible that chloroplasts do not exhibit detectable DAPI-DNA staining because cpDNA is present as dispersed small molecules incapable of generating a strong signal. In this and the following section, we further characterize the changes in structure of cpDNA molecules during Arabidopsis leaf development in order to examine this possibility.</p><p>Chloroplast DNA molecules were classified according to their structural complexity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Complex forms (Class I; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;C</xref>) were observed in all tissues examined. Most of the cpDNA forms observed from the first and second rosette leaves of 9-day-old plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, D, G</xref>) were found in Class I. Some of the Class I forms were very large, consisting of many fibers connected to multiple cores (See Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Class I forms were observed less frequently among cpDNA molecules from whole 20-day-old plant tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B, E, H</xref>) and the third rosette leaf of 31-day-old plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C, F, I</xref>). The frequency of Class III forms (cpDNA fragments without any complex structures) was highest for the mature rosette leaf tissue. We conclude that cpDNA in Arabidopsis progresses from complex branched forms to simpler, fragmented forms during leaf development.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of the structural forms of cpDNA molecules from different tissues</bold>.

In one method, we measured the DAPI-DNA fluorescence and calculated the number of genomes per plastid using Vaccinia virus particles as a standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and we used qPCR in the other method.

Using real-time PCR with the single copy nuclear gene <italic>ROC1</italic>, the number of 18S copies per haploid nuclear genome was determined to be 568 &#x000b1; 158, which is similar to the 700 &#x000b1; 60 value reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The ratio of chloroplast to nuclear DNA is higher for immature tissues (samples 1&#x02013;3) compared with older tissues (samples 4&#x02013;6), regardless of whether a single copy or multiple copy gene was used for the nuclear DNA. Taking into account the number of copies of 18S per haploid nuclear genome and the average ploidy of the cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), we calculated the number of plastomes per cell (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>). We similarly calculated the number of plastomes per cell for data collected using the <italic>ROC1 </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref>). In both cases, the number of plastomes per cell was lowest in the youngest tissue (255 &#x000b1; 13 for 18S and 301 &#x000b1; 22 for <italic>ROC1</italic>). The rest of the tissues varied between 465 &#x000b1; 22 and 894 &#x000b1; 65 plastomes per cell without any obvious developmental trend. Zoschke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] similarly observed (using qPCR to determine the ratio of several plastid genes to the nuclear <italic>18S </italic>gene) that the number of plastomes per cell varies from 1000 to 1500 without developmental correlation. A conclusion that seems to follow from these results is that the cpDNA content per cell does not decline during development, as it does for individual chloroplasts (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) and the fraction of total DNA represented by cpDNA (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B, C</xref>). This conclusion requires that the stability of cpDNA is the same among cells irrespective of nuclear ploidy level, a matter discussed below.</p><p>We prepared protoplasts from 10-day-old (young), 12-day-old (intermediate), and 24-day-old (mature) first and second rosette leaves. The number of chloroplasts per cell was greater for the intermediate than the young leaves (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the chloroplast number per cell between intermediate (12-day) and mature (24-day) rosette leaves. The number of genomes per chloroplast is two-fold higher for the intermediate 12-day-old than for the mature 20- or 26-day-old plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Thus, the decline in cpDNA as leaves mature (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) cannot be due only to dilution as chloroplasts divide, but must be primarily due to the degradation of cpDNA.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Number of chloroplasts per cell during development.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Tissue</td><td align="left">Chloroplasts per cell</td><td align="left">Number of cells analyzed</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Young</td><td align="left">25.6 &#x000b1; 1.9<sup>a</sup></td><td align="left">27</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Intermediate</td><td align="left">39.1 &#x000b1; 3.3<sup>b</sup></td><td align="left">34</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mature</td><td align="left">48.4 &#x000b1; 7.5<sup>b</sup></td><td align="left">17</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Young: first and second leaves from 10-day-old plants.

For six species of flowering plants, a decrease in plastid genome copy number during leaf maturation shows that cpDNA can be added to this list. Measurements of cpDNA per plastid showed that Arabidopsis and tobacco were similar to the other six. But in other reports on tobacco and Arabidopsis, it was concluded that the amount of cpDNA remained constant as leaves matured. As discussed below, however, one report relied on non-quantitative data to reach a quantitative conclusion regarding cpDNA, and the other relied on the assumption that the computation of cpDNA per cell using qPCR and flow cytometry is an accurate representation. Furthermore, in both of these reports, only one method was used to assess cpDNA amount during development. Our data, obtained by multiple methods, show that Arabidopsis is typical with respect to cpDNA loss during leaf development.</p><p>We have evaluated alternative hypotheses for the decline in cpDNA amount during development in Arabidopsis. Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and Zoschke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] proposed that the reduction in cpDNA content reported for mature leaves is an artifact that results from the loss of cpDNA during chloroplast isolation. Our present data, however, contradict this proposal because we find a decline in cpDNA for chloroplasts within cells as observed in leaf sections. Furthermore, Kato et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] found that plastids of white sectors of the <italic>yellow variegated2 </italic>mutant contain more DNA than those of green sectors, as evidenced by staining leaf sections and protoplasts with DAPI and Hoechst dyes. The data presented by these authors were also obtained for plastids within cells and suggest that DNA content declines during plastid differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Under a second hypothesis, the reduced DAPI fluorescence of mature chloroplasts is not due to a reduction in DNA amount, but is due to a reduction in the size of cpDNA molecules. Although our moving pictures do show that cpDNA molecules become smaller and more fragmented during development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), DNA content of chloroplasts measured by both DAPI fluorescence and by qPCR was about two- to three-fold higher in immature tissues than in mature tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), consistent with the two- to seven-fold change in cpDNA reported previously for a broader developmental range of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, low levels of DAPI fluorescence in mature chloroplasts accurately reflect low DNA contents. Furthermore, examination of individual chloroplasts by DAPI-staining reveals the range of DNA contents among plastids, as well as the DNA distribution within the plastid and plastid size, parameters that cannot be assessed by qPCR.</p><p>A reduction in the amount of DNA present in an individual chloroplast can result from either cpDNA degradation or dilution during chloroplast division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A third hypothesis, therefore, is that the observed decline in cpDNA content occurs only because of dilution. We observed a reduction in cpDNA amount between intermediate and mature stages of plant development without an increase in the number of chloroplasts per cell over this period. Thus, division alone cannot explain the low level of DNA present in mature chloroplasts.</p><p>We found that the proportion of total cellular DNA represented by cpDNA declines during development, using blot-hybridization as the method of assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] concluded that cpDNA levels remained constant throughout development in Arabidopsis (as determined by inspection, but not quantification, of some of their blot-hybridization signals). However, these authors neglected to discuss the data presented in their Figure 3b (lanes 2 and 3), which showed a seemingly greater amount of cpDNA in a young leaf than a mature leaf. In addition, they did not use a nuclear DNA probe in blot-hybridization in order to determine whether equal amounts of DNA were loaded in the lanes to be compared, further confounding the qualitative interpretation of hybridization signals. Lastly, the developmental age of the tissue was not clearly defined. We show that cpDNA amount does remain constant after the decline has occurred (even in senescent leaves; Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). It is possible that the tissues showing no apparent change in signal have already passed the stage during which cpDNA levels decline. Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] also concluded that cpDNA remains constant during tobacco leaf development using visual inspection of blot-hybridization signals from cpDNA and ''promiscuous'' cpDNA in the nucleus. We found that DNA per tobacco chloroplast increases during early leaf development and then decreases, but does not reach undetectable levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Since Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] did not specify the age of their tobacco plants, we cannot determine whether their data conflict with ours for tobacco. Since for both tobacco and Arabidopsis, the well was not included in the image of the blot-hybridization, the extent of restriction digestion cannot be assessed. For Arabidopsis, however, our quantitative data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) show that cpDNA declines during leaf development when the blot-hybridization assay is used, in agreement with inspection of lanes 2 and 3 of Figure 3b of Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and the lack of hybridization in the well indicates a complete restriction digest.</p><p>We found that the ratio of chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA (determined by qPCR) in young tissues was two- to three-fold higher than in mature tissues. A two- to three-fold reduction of this ratio was also reported by Zoschke et al ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; see their Figure 2b). We used the ratio of chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA to calculate the number of plastomes per cell based on the mean nuclear ploidy (determined by flow cytometry). The calculated number of plastomes per cell did not appear to vary substantially during development. This result apparently contradicts our data showing a decline in cpDNA during development. We now evaluate the assumptions in the method used to calculate plastomes per cell in order to resolve this contradiction.</p><p>A reduction in the ratio of chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA can result from either an increase in nuclear DNA (a ploidy level increase) or a decrease in cpDNA. It is clear that the amount of nuclear DNA increases during development (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). We did not observe a slight decrease in mean nuclear ploidy at late stages of leaf development, as was reported by Zoschke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Mean ploidy at these stages was reduced only 20&#x02013;25% and the authors found an overall trend of increasing ploidy with leaf age. This increase does not occur uniformly among all cells, however, as evidenced by the increase in the proportion of cells in the highest ploidy classes at the later stages of leaf development (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Thus, some cells experience more rounds of endoreduplication than others. In addition, the decrease in cpDNA content may not occur uniformly among cells. Chloroplasts exhibit both a larger range in DNA content and a higher mean DNA content in seedling shoots and intermediate-aged leaves than in mature leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, many of the chloroplasts from the immature tissues contain a similarly low amount of DNA as chloroplasts from mature leaves (in immature samples, the mean cpDNA content is high because some chloroplasts contain a lot of DNA, more than 100 genome equivalents). Thus it is likely that a substantial proportion of chloroplasts have already undergone a reduction in DNA even at an immature stage, indicating that not all cells initiate the reduction process at the same time. Furthermore, in some cells the cpDNA content may not change during development. For the leaves of wheat, Miyamura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] reported that the DNA content of non-photosynthetic plastids remains low, never approaching the high levels seen in developing chloroplasts. Thus, cells containing non-photosynthetic plastids, such as those found in the epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and vasculature, may undergo endoreduplication, but may not contribute to the changes in DNA content observed for plastids obtained from leaves. Such cells comprise about half of the cells in Arabidopsis leaves (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p><p>We propose that the calculation of plastomes per cell, which is based on the ratio of chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA and the mean nuclear ploidy, leads to the erroneous conclusion that cpDNA per cell remains constant during development because not all cells participate equally in endoreduplication and reduction of cpDNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Let us consider the change in DNA amounts between immature and mature tissues. On average, the mean amount of DNA per plastid is reduced about two- to three-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and legend) and the mean amount of nuclear DNA increases by the same amount (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>, compare tissues 2 and 3 to 5). The number of chloroplasts per cell remains constant during this period (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, compare intermediate and mature tissues), so that the decrease in mean amount of DNA per plastid results in a two- to three-fold decrease in the proportion of total DNA represented by cpDNA. We now consider two types of cells: those in which nuclear DNA increases, but cpDNA does not decrease (Cell Type 1 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) and those with no increase in nuclear DNA but a decrease in cpDNA (Cell Type 2). In Type 1 cells, the amount of DNA per plastid and the number of plastids per cell remain constant, but the ratio of chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA decreases because the nuclear ploidy increases. Cells containing non-photosynthetic plastids or those containing photosynthetic plastids that have already undergone a reduction in cpDNA at the immature stage may be Type 1 Cells. In Type 2 cells, plastids per cell is also constant, but the decrease in DNA per plastid leads to a decrease in the chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA ratio. These Type 2 cells may be cells containing photosynthetic plastids that undergo a reduction of cpDNA between the immature and mature stages of leaf development. The net change for the population of cells (consisting of both cell types) is a decrease in the amount of DNA per plastid, a constant number of plastids per cell, an increase in nuclear DNA amount, and a decrease in the chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA ratio.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>A model for change in cpDNA and nuclear DNA (nDNA) amount during development</bold>. The change in parameters affecting cpDNA and nDNA amount between immature and mature tissues is represented. Two cell types are shown, along with the net change expected for a population of both cell types. Arrows indicate an increase or decrease. Dashes indicate no change. In Type 1 cells, cpDNA/plastid and plastids/cell are constant, and the nDNA increase leads to a decrease in cpDNA/nDNA. In Type 2 cells, cpDNA/plastid declines, but both plastid number and nDNA remain constant, leading to a decrease in cpDNA/nDNA. The net change for the population is an increase in nDNA, no change in plastids/cell, and a decrease in both cpDNA/plastid and cpDNA/nDNA. <italic>Shaded boxes </italic>indicate the parameters used to calculate plastomes/cell, based on qPCR and mean ploidy using flow cytometry. Data obtained from these methods represent the net change in nDNA and cpDNA/nDNA for the population and do not assess the cpDNA/plastid. The net increase in nDNA/cell is similar to the net decrease in cpDNA/nDNA because Type 1 cells contribute to the increase in ploidy without contributing greatly to the change in cpDNA/nDNA. As a result, calculation of plastomes/cell yields a similar value for immature and mature tissues, and there appears to be no net change in plastomes/cell (left half of the box in the bottom right corner). If qPCR and flow cytometry could be performed on each cell type separately, calculation of plastomes/cell would reveal no change for Type 1, a decrease for Type 2, and a net decrease for the population (right half of the box), because the contribution of individual cells to the increase in nuclear ploidy and decrease in cpDNA/nDNA could be assessed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2229-9-3-9"/></fig><p>When calculating the number of plastomes per cell, we can only measure the change in nuclear DNA amount (by flow cytometry) and the change in the chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA ratio (by qPCR) for the whole population of cells (shaded boxes in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The fold increase in ploidy for the whole population is similar to the fold decrease in chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA ratio. One interpretation of these results is that the decrease in the chloroplast-to-nuclear ratio occurs only because the nuclear DNA copy number is increasing and that cpDNA amount does not decline during development. However, this interpretation is contradicted by our data for individual chloroplasts, considering that chloroplasts are not dividing during this time (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Furthermore, if the calculated number of plastomes per cell were correct, then chloroplasts from intermediate-aged leaves would be expected to have an average of only 16 genomes per chloroplast (612 plastomes per cell [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>] divided by 39 plastids per cell [Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>]), which is also contradicted by our measured values (58 genomes per plastid, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> legend). Another interpretation is that all cells do not participate equally in endoreduplication and cpDNA reduction. Under this interpretation, a reduction in the chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA ratio is due to an increase in nuclear DNA only for some cells (Type 1) and is due to a decrease in cpDNA for others (Type 2). Type 1 cells make a large contribution to the net increase in mean ploidy and a much smaller contribution to the net reduction in cpDNA because these cells contain a small amount of cpDNA. Type 2 cells do not contribute to the net increase in ploidy, but contribute greatly to the net reduction in the chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA ratio. Thus, the net increase in nuclear ploidy of about two- to three-fold approximates the net decrease in the chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA ratio. The calculation of plastomes per cell is based on only these two parameters, giving the impression that there is no change (left portion of the bottom box under "plastomes per cell" in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), and this interpretation is consistent with all of our data. If it were possible to analyze the change in nuclear ploidy and the chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA ratio for individual cells, a net decrease in plastomes per cell would be evident (right portion of the bottom box under "plastomes/cell" in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) because a change in the chloroplast-to-nuclear DNA ratio could be directly ascribed to a change in either chloroplast or nuclear DNA amount for a given cell.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We find that the amount of cpDNA declines during development of Arabidopsis leaves and that cpDNA is degraded <italic>in vivo</italic>. This conclusion is supported by each of the several methods we employed, with each elucidating a different aspect of that decline. Examination of DNA at the level of individual plastids shows changes in the average amount of cpDNA, its location within the plastid, and the range of DNA content among plastids. Visualizing individual cpDNA molecules reveals the change in their size, complexity, and structure. These data are consistent with our previous conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] that whereas the average DNA content per plastid declines only several-fold, the DNA of individual plastids can decline to undetectable levels. Calculation of plastomes per cell by combining data obtained from qPCR and flow cytometry can be used to assess cpDNA change <italic>per cell </italic>for tissues with a nuclear DNA content that is constant during development. For maize, a species without endoreduplication in shoot tissues, we found that qPCR-based calculation of plastomes per cell reflected the same decline in cpDNA amount obtained with individual plastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. For species like Arabidopsis with a high degree of endoreduplication, however, the calculation can be misleading because the cpDNA for an average cell is computed from data obtained from a mix of different cell types and would not accurately reflect cell-to-cell variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. If all cells do not participate equally in endoreduplication and decline of cpDNA, this method cannot be used to determine whether the amount of DNA per chloroplast is changing during development. To avoid confounding variables such as endoreduplication, plastomes per cell can also be calculated using methods that do not rely on nuclear DNA. Individual chloroplasts from intermediate-aged leaves of Arabidopsis contain 58 genomes on average (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> legend). As there are about 39 chloroplasts per cell (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), this gives 2262 plastomes per cell. In comparison, there are 1152 &#x02013; 1200 plastomes per cell in mature tissues. In summary, we have demonstrated that the amount of DNA per chloroplast declines <italic>in vivo </italic>during development in Arabidopsis, at least for the environmental conditions and tissues examined. Whether cpDNA per cell declines depends on the method used to calculate the amount of cpDNA per cell.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Growth conditions</title><p>Seeds of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>(Col.) were sown in soil and held at 4&#x000b0;C for at least 72 h to promote uniform germination.

Tissue samples consisting of leaves that are less than 30% of their maximum length are described as "young". Tissue samples consisting of leaves 30&#x02013;70% of their maximum length or seedling shoots are described as "intermediate". Under our growth conditions, the first and second rosette leaves typically reach a maximum length of 10 mm; thus a first or second rosette leaf that is 2 mm long is 20% of its maximum size. However, a 2 mm long eighth rosette leaf (which reaches an average maximum size of 24 mm) is only 8% of its maximum size. Both young and intermediate leaves are described as "immature". Fully expanded leaves are described as "mature". Leaves that are fully expanded and starting to yellow are described as "senescent".</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of chloroplasts and protoplasts and preparation of leaf sections</title><p>To minimize microbial contamination, plant tissue was soaked in 0.5% sarksoyl for 3&#x02013;5 min and rinsed thoroughly before isolating chloroplasts following the high salt protocol that does not include treatment with DNase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Chloroplasts were washed and resuspended in sorbitol dilution buffer (SDB; 0.33 M sorbitol, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% bovine serum albumin [BSA] adjusted to pH 7.6) and layered over 70% Percoll in SDB.

Lysis of a known concentration of chloroplasts was performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Amounts of cpDNA ranging from 5 fg/&#x003bc;L to 50 pg/&#x003bc;L were used to generate a standard curve for determining the concentration of cpDNA present in the chloroplast lysates. Standards were diluted in the same solution as used for the lysates to provide identical reaction conditions for standards and unknowns. The forward primer 5' TTGCGGTCAATAAGGTAGGG 3' and reverse primer 5' TAGAGAATTTGTGCGCTTGG 3' were used to amplify a 189-bp fragment including part of the <italic>psb</italic>A gene and an intergenic region. Amplification of 1 &#x003bc;L chloroplast DNA was carried out using the iQ&#x02122; SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Following an initial denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 3 min, 45 cycles of 15 s denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C, 15 s annealing at 57&#x000b0;C, and 20 s extension at 72&#x000b0;C were performed and amplification of the reactions monitored using the Chromo 4 real-time detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). A melting curve from 65&#x000b0;C to 95&#x000b0;C was used to confirm the presence of single products. Data were analyzed using the Opticon Monitor 3 software (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and the amount of DNA in each of the unknown samples was determined in fg/&#x003bc;L. One fg represents approximately 6.3 copies of the chloroplast genome. The number of copies of the chloroplast genome per &#x003bc;L was calculated from the number of fg/&#x003bc;L divided by the number of chloroplasts per &#x003bc;L to obtain the number of copies of the chloroplast genome per chloroplast. Twelve replicates of each sample were analyzed. Control reactions with no template resulted in no amplification of the cpDNA fragment.</p><p>For relative quantification of chloroplast genomes per nuclear genome, the Nucleon Phytopure DNA isolation kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) was used to prepare total DNA from plants at the stages of development indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. The forward primer 5'AGAGACGCGAAAGCGAAAG3' and reverse primer 5'CTGGAGGAGCAGCAATGAA3' were used to amplify a 156-bp portion of the chloroplast <italic>psb</italic>A gene.

An 854-bp fragment of the chloroplast <italic>pet</italic>A gene and a 1050-bp fragment of the nuclear <italic>DRT100 </italic>gene were labeled with alkaline phosphatase using the AlkPhos Direct Labeling Reagents, and hybridization was detected using the CDP-Star Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The hybridization signals were quantified using NIH Image J software. Lanes on the image of the blot were selected and the software plotted the intensity of the signal down the lane. A sharp peak was observed at the location of the band. The area under this peak was calculated using the instructions provided on the Image J website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/menus/analyze.html"/>. The peak with the largest area was given a value of 100, and all other peak areas were expressed relative to that value. These values are shown below the lanes in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. Serial dilutions of undigested DNA ranging from ~0.3 ng to 10 ng were prepared, spotted onto an N+ nylon membrane, alkali denatured, neutralized and hybridized with the <italic>petA </italic>probe.
