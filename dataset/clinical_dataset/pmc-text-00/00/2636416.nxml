Barriers to accessing effective end of life care included resource constrained services; institutional and, occasionally, personal racial and religious discrimination; limited awareness and understanding among South Asian people of the role of hospices; and difficulty discussing death. The most vulnerable patients, including recent migrants and those with poor English language skills, with no family advocate, and dying of non-malignant diseases were at particularly high risk of inadequate care.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> Despite a robust Scottish diversity policy, services for South Asian Sikh and Muslim patients with life limiting illness were wanting in many key areas. Active case management of the most vulnerable patients and carers, and &#x0201c;real time&#x0201d; support, from where professionals can obtain advice specific to an individual patient and family, are the approaches most likely to instigate noticeable improvements in access to high quality end of life care. Improving access to palliative care for all, particularly those with non-malignant illnesses, as well as focusing on the specific needs of ethnic minority groups, is required.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In palliative care the dominant notion of a good death is based on a patient being fully aware of their diagnosis and prognosis and able to engage in advance care planning. This does not, however, necessarily reflect different social, cultural, and spiritual beliefs and practices around death and dying as expressed by ethnic minority groups and faith groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> In some communities, for example, the diagnosis of a life limiting illness is not openly discussed and end of life decisions are more family focused.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Considerations about faith have often been overlooked in research, and end of life needs in minority groups remain poorly understood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p><p>In the United States and the United Kingdom people from ethnic minority communities access proportionately fewer palliative care services than the majority population, although deficits in recording ethnicity and socioeconomic status make it difficult to determine accurately the extent of inequalities and inequities in care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> We use the term access to incorporate more than accessibility&#x02014;it requires patients to be able to actually make use of appropriate and high quality care. Factors contributing to poor access to palliative care services include low numbers of referrals of patients from ethnic minority communities to palliative care; lack of knowledge and awareness of palliative care among ethnic minority groups; communication difficulties between service providers and users, including language barriers; mistrust and dissatisfaction with services; and lack of accessible information leading to misunderstandings around the nature of the illness and prognosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> Family carers too are disadvantaged by poor access to services, with impact on their physical and mental health, employment, and educational opportunities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></p><p>Access to specialist palliative care services remains predominantly focused on cancer. Services for those with non-cancer illnesses are largely provided by generalists, who may be less aware of the need for a palliative care approach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> Epidemiological studies indicate that the incidence of cancer is lower among migrants to the UK than the overall population, but it is rising.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> Rates of other life limiting illnesses, such as coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes are, however, comparatively higher than in the population overall.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> These differences in disease risk among ethnic groups may also contribute to the lower access to palliative care experienced by ethnic minority groups.</p><p>South Asian Sikh and Muslim communities are among the largest, established ethnic minority groups in the UK and Europe. These migrant communities, which began arriving in large numbers in the aftermath of the second world war, are now ageing, with important implications for service provision. Understanding their end of life needs is an important first step in developing appropriate, equitable, and accessible care services for all and in making palliative care a credible and attractive choice for South Asians.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p><p>We studied the care experiences and needs of South Asian Sikh and Muslim patients with life limiting illness and of their families from the perspectives of the patient, family carer, and key health professionals. Through understanding the barriers and facilitators to accessing services identified by participants in our study, and relating these to the wider theoretical literature and policy, we aimed to inform service developments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The projected sample size of 20-25 participants was determined by experience of previous longitudinal qualitative studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> which led us to believe that this would generate sufficient data to answer the research questions. We purposively recruited South Asian Sikh and Muslim patients with cancer and other life limiting conditions who were believed to have a prognosis of less than a year. Box 1 gives definitions of ethnicity, race, faiths, and languages of participants. Recruitment among ethnic minority groups is known to be challenging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> and we therefore planned a combination of approaches to patients through healthcare and social care professionals, community leaders, and personal contacts of the research team in local Sikh and Muslim communities. The composition of the research team was in part guided by this need. The researchers approached health professionals, community and religious leaders, and volunteer workers to identify eligible individuals they knew to have advanced incurable illness. They then gave an information sheet about the project to the potential participant in English as well as in Gurumukhi or Urdu, depending on their country of origin or religious affiliation. If they expressed interest in taking part, the patient&#x02019;s name was passed to the research team. The trilingual researcher (TI) explained the study verbally and obtained written consent in the language of each participant&#x02019;s choice. Consent was reconfirmed verbally before each interview, carried out at intervals of three or four months. Patients were asked to nominate a family carer and the health professional most involved in their support and care, and these individuals were approached and gave consent separately. If no new insights emerged during the second interview, patients were contacted by telephone before the third interview and, if their circumstances were unchanged, were not interviewed again.</p><boxed-text position="float" content-type="style2"><sec><title>Box 1: Definitions of ethnicity, race, faiths, and languages of participants</title><sec><title>Ethnicity</title><p>The social group someone belongs to and either identifies with or is identified with by others as a result of a mix of cultural and other factors, including one or more of language, diet, religion, ancestry, and physical textures traditionally associated with race</p></sec><sec><title>Race</title><p>The group someone belongs to as a result of a mix of physical features such as skin colour and hair texture, which reflect ancestry and geographical origins, as identified by others or, increasingly, self identified</p></sec><sec><title>Racism or institutional racism</title><p>A belief that some races are superior to others, used to devise and justify individual and collective actions that create and sustain inequality among racial and ethnic groups.

In addition, 18 carers and 20 healthcare and social care professionals were recruited. The total dataset comprised 92 interviews.

Seven patients were Sikhs and 18 were Muslims, reflecting the relative size of these populations in Scotland.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref> Most lived in nuclear or extended families, with only three living alone. Six patients died during the study. The family carers nominated were predominantly women, with seven wives, five daughters, and four daughters-in-law taking part in the study, along with four husbands and one son. Four patients had no family carer and a further three carers declined to participate. Among the range of professionals nominated, most (n=13) were general practitioners. Others included consultants, specialist nurses, social workers, and one hospital manager.

It was evident from the responses of patients, family carers, and professionals that the barriers to accessing end of life care arose from the perceptions and beliefs of ethnic minority communities about death and dying and end of life care, in the inflexibility of services, and in the attitudes of service providers.</p><sec><title>Barriers among patients and families</title><p>Box 6 summarises the barriers to accessing appropriate care among patients and families. Planning effective end of life care was difficult when there was a lack of open discussion about dying. Families sometimes controlled information, especially when they acted as interpreters between the patient and health professionals. This created tension for health professionals, as most subscribed to a philosophy of openness. For example, when oncology staff wanted to tell a patient she had cancer and why she was receiving chemotherapy, the carer insisted that her mother, who spoke no English, was not told the diagnosis as she feared her mother would &#x0201c;totally give up&#x0201d; (carer 11). Even in the hospice setting this perception could lead to family members asking for information to be withheld: a woman who acted as an interpreter for her husband did not want hospice staff to discuss his poor prognosis; it was apparent from the interview with the patient, however, that he had a much clearer idea of his prognosis than the carer suggested:</p><disp-quote content-type="style1"><p>&#x0201c;I said to them &#x02018;don&#x02019;t tell him how long,&#x02019; but they said if he asks any questions, they&#x02019;ll have to tell him.

Services often had difficulty managing basic needs such as communication with non-English speakers, the halal diet (that which is allowed in Islam), and need for specific hygiene practices, such as wudu (ritual ablution preceding daily prayers) and istinja (washing with free flowing water after urination or a bowel movement). At times care was clearly culturally insensitive. For example, one female Muslim patient had to accept help with toileting from male nurses when no female nurses were on duty and felt humiliated:</p><disp-quote content-type="style1"><p>&#x0201c;There were only two males in the department so what do you do then? [sounding anxious] I had to get help but they said &#x02018;we won&#x02019;t look&#x02019; but look is not everything, you can feel as well.

In some cases the patient was required to translate between the health professional and the family, creating problems at the very end of life:</p><disp-quote content-type="style1"><p>&#x0201c;One of the great concerns I have is house calls, where the only person who is able to speak in English is the patient who is dying. That is not useful in that the input that I could give in support to the rest of the family is much more restricted because it is only the patient who is the conduit for passing on the information. I don&#x02019;t think that is always the best thing.&#x0201d; (Patient 2, interview with professional)</p></disp-quote><p>Services were often reactive rather than based on needs, with little flexibility about timing or roles performed. They therefore struggled to meet complex or variable needs. Constraints on resources were obvious, and reliance on family carers was overtly acknowledged:</p><disp-quote content-type="style1"><p>&#x0201c;Part of the problem is that we wait until the problems arise and we don&#x02019;t even look for problems&#x02014;we wait for families to tell us themselves and complain.&#x0201d; (Patient 5, interview with social care professional)</p></disp-quote></sec></sec><sec><title>Overcoming barriers: an illustration of discrimination and effective advocacy</title><p>A Sikh patient with multiple long term conditions, who was homeless and an asylum seeker, complained of rude, hostile attitudes by staff, neglect of his needs, continually receiving inappropriate food, and feeling humiliated by staff hostility if he complained about the food or asked questions about his treatment:</p><disp-quote content-type="style1"><p>&#x0201c;One of the nurses said to me that &#x02018;I will paint a horrible picture of you and report you to the immigration and they will deport you,&#x02019; that&#x02019;s how they treat me.&#x0201d; (Patient 6, Sikh man with non-malignant illness, stage 1 interview)</p></disp-quote><p>He described how Asian staff advised him:</p><disp-quote content-type="style1"><p>&#x0201c;They tell me to keep smiling all the time.

Exploring the end of life needs of ethnic minority and faith communities qualitatively over time from patient, family carer, and professional perspectives offers important new insights. Previous studies have found that palliative care services are not culturally sensitive.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> The risk of cultural misunderstandings around end of life care may grow with increasing heterogeneity of ethnic and religious groups,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref> but there is also potential for increased understanding and integration.</p><p>Over a decade on from the seminal <italic>Opening Doors</italic> report,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> services still have difficulty in meeting non-mainstream end of life needs effectively. Feelings of exclusion from mainstream society and services are an additional previously unrecognised barrier to access.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref> Services were often inflexible and unable to respond effectively when faced with &#x0201c;atypical&#x0201d; needs&#x02014;for example, culturally appropriate food or sex specific staff to provide personal care. This resulted in patients and carers perceiving themselves as being discriminated against and treated with a lack of respect and dignity, negating core principles of government and healthcare policy. The recent Darzi report emphasised the core requirement for high quality, personalised services, with particular care needed for those least likely to seek help because they feel discriminated against.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref> Our study showed that it is possible for existing services to provide good end of life care for such patients and families&#x02014;this was particularly evident in hospices and some primary care services where the key component was an individualised approach to end of life care.</p><p>The barriers to accessing the best quality care were complex and apparent in the cultural perceptions of patients and families as well as constraints on services. These could, even in the most difficult cases, however, be overcome by effective advocacy from service providers, as indicated by the case of the Sikh patient, whose experience of care was transformed by such intervention. Misconceptions about hospice and palliative care are particularly common in ethnic minority groups and the least affluent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> Although a hospice was perceived by some South Asian people in our study as a potentially alienating experience, the care received by two patients suggests that once accessed, hospices can provide culturally sensitive care, so helping families to overcome these false stereotypes. Responsibilities, however, also lie with South Asian communities to be open to the idea of accepting help, for the benefit of both patients and families. This is particularly true where family care is made difficult by dispersed families and complex end of life needs.</p><p>Equitable access to culturally competent services for all ethnic groups is a Scottish health policy requirement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref> that has resulted in a considerable increase in awareness among service providers of the needs of ethnic minorities. Our study shows that this has not necessarily led to development of the structures or skills that will enable professionals to deliver culturally appropriate end of life care. Effective practice can be hampered by uncertainty, hesitancy, and inertia in the face of worries about cultural competence, possibly contributing to institutional racism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref> Medical education has also been affected by staff&#x02019;s lack of confidence in delivering education on ethnic diversity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref> Health professionals can be distressed by their (perceived or actual) inability to provide good care for people from ethnic minority groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref> Professionals in our study stressed their desire to deliver culturally competent care, but also expressed uncertainties about cultural aspects of complex end of life care. Our experiences suggest that &#x0201c;real time&#x0201d; advice on appropriate responses, where professionals could discuss an individual patient at the time they are providing care, would be helpful in building the skills and confidence to deliver culturally sensitive palliative care to an increasingly diverse population.</p><p>Equitable access to appropriate end of life care is not merely an issue for people from ethnic minority groups and faith backgrounds.

The methodological approach also enabled us to identify the direct, rather than perceived, discrimination this case exemplifies, by interviewing the key professional. Additional strengths include the high proportion of participants that agreed to participate (96%) and the high retention rate, with most attrition occurring because of death.</p><p>Finding potential participants was, as anticipated, difficult. Identifying people at the end of life is complex owing to difficulties in prognosticating, particularly in non-cancer illness; therefore a few patients recruited were not, it emerged, in the last year of life. Although we recruited participants of various ages and socioeconomic backgrounds, with a variety of conditions and severity of disease, and had a high recruitment rate, it is difficult in qualitative studies of this kind to be certain of the broader generalisability of our findings. But by linking our in-depth data with the theoretical literature and the team&#x02019;s comprehensive practical experience of service provision in end of life care and care for ethnic minority groups we are able to make credible recommendations applicable beyond Scotland.</p></sec><sec><title>Recognising vulnerability</title><p>Our work confirms that many palliative care needs cut across cultural differences and that individualised care is vital.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref> The premise that ethnic minority groups have the same needs as the rest of the population is too simplistic. Vulnerability leads to greater risk of poor health and poorer access to services. Additional support for people from ethnic minority groups, who are sometimes doubly disadvantaged by, for example, poverty or language barriers, is required to enable them to access services more effectively. Prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable patients and carers might be a particularly effective way of reducing inequalities. Systematic identification of multiple risk factors may be a more effective strategy for addressing access to health care than a fragmented focus on single factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Our data suggest that trigger factors for recognising such vulnerability in patients with advanced illness include social deprivation, insufficient spoken English to communicate needs effectively, non-cancer illness, multiple comorbidities, lack of support from the family and community, and new migrants and those with uncertain legal status, such as asylum seekers. These factors, when married with culturally specific needs according to religion, such as food, hygiene, and modesty, can lead to exclusion from services.</p><p>Understanding patients&#x02019; needs is a prerequisite for services to be able to adapt to meet them.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref> The lack of national data on access to services by various groups creates difficulties in measuring progress in policy implementation. This study suggests that a considerable gap remains between the good intentions of many professionals and of social inclusion policy and the realities of service provision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Implications for policy, practice, and research</title><p>Building on this in-depth qualitative work, research needs to develop and evaluate multifaceted interventions aimed at improving identification of the most vulnerable patients, assessment of their needs, and provision of better care. Individual case management based on recognition of vulnerability may be a key to more equitable service provision, not just for ethnic minority groups but for all those who have poor access, including lower income groups and those with non-malignant illness. Improving care for ethnic minority groups involves partnership working where professionals are able to acknowledge their lack of knowledge and expertise in cultural practices and take advice from patients, families, and community groups. Active outreach and community development with South Asian communities should help to raise awareness and overcome misconceptions of palliative and hospice care; such initiatives could, for example, include hospice open days, staff visiting religious and community centres, or interacting with local South Asian media outlets. Engagement of interpreting services should replace reliance on communication with the patient solely through the family. A need also exists to appreciate better the situations in which such interpreter input is non-negotiable, such as taking consent.</p><p>A change in emphasis is needed in the education and training of cultural awareness or diversity to move it away from the lecture theatre and out to service providers, with in-house, multidisciplinary, practice based, case based training in primary care, social services, hospitals, and hospices. Involving patients and members of communities in the delivery, evaluation, and support of professional training is important. In UK primary care, points from the quality outcomes framework (and hence reimbursement) are now available for significant event analysis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref> where care teams are encouraged to reflect on real cases and to identify strengths and weaknesses in care provided. This could be adapted to diversity training, with facilitation from an expert in the discipline.</p><p>Greater emphasis on culturally appropriate end of life care, incorporating spiritual aspects, is needed in undergraduate and postgraduate curriculums, for health and social care professionals, and for care staff. Education and training based mainly on descriptions of differences run the risk of reinforcing stereotypes; awareness of cultural complexity and practitioners&#x02019; self reflection should therefore be core aspects of education.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref> Resources are available to support clinicians and educators in developing cultural competence, including the NHS ethnicity and health specialist library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.library.nhs.uk/ethnicity">www.library.nhs.uk/ethnicity</ext-link>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Policy directives aimed at improving access to services and standards of care for ethnic minority groups in Scotland are laudable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> It seems, however, that end of life services for South Asian Sikh and Muslim patients remain wanting in many key areas. Our findings indicate that professionals recognise these shortcomings and would be receptive to initiatives focused on improving service delivery for these populations. More individualised care prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable patients and carers and making available real time support and advice for healthcare and social care professionals are likely to be particularly effective strategies for improving care and tackling inequalities, so ensuring better outcomes for patients.</p><boxed-text position="float" content-type="style3"><sec><title>What is already known on this topic</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>People from ethnic minority groups are less likely to access palliative care services than the majority population</p></list-item><list-item><p>Barriers to access include attitudes of the patient, family, and professionals</p></list-item><list-item><p>End of life needs in minority groups are poorly understood</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What this study adds</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Within ethnic minority groups the most vulnerable people, such as recent migrants, have the poorest access to services</p></list-item><list-item><p>Active case management of high risk patients should help to overcome many of these barriers</p></list-item><list-item><p>Professionals need ready access to information and support specific to an individual patient and family</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text></sec></sec></body><back><notes><fn-group><fn><p>We thank the patients, family carers, and professionals who participated in the studies; those who helped with recruitment; and Shahida Shah for secretarial support.</p></fn><fn fn-type="participating-researchers"><p>Contributors: AS conceived the study and all grant holders (AS, AW, SM, EG, MK, RB, JL, DB, JA, and RG) developed the design.
