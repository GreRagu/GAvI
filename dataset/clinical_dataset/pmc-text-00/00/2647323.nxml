This amplification method is achievable at a constant temperature (e.g. 60&#x000b0;C) simply by mixing circular single-stranded DNA probe, DNA polymerase and nicking enzyme. Unlike conventional nucleic-acid amplification reactions such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), this reaction does not require exogenous primers, which often cause primer dimerization or non-specific amplification. Instead, &#x02018;primers&#x02019; are generated and accumulated during the reaction. The circular probe carries only two sequences: (i) a hybridization sequence to the sample DNA and (ii) a recognition sequence of the nicking enzyme. In PG&#x02013;RCA, the circular probe first hybridizes with the sample DNA, and then a cascade reaction of linear rolling circle amplification and nicking reactions takes place. In contrast with conventional linear rolling circle amplification, the signal amplification is in an exponential mode since many copies of &#x02018;primers&#x02019; are successively produced by multiple nicking reactions. Under the optimized condition, we obtained a remarkable sensitivity of 84.5 ymol (50.7 molecules) of synthetic sample DNA and 0.163 pg (&#x0223c;60 molecules) of genomic DNA from <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, indicating strong applicability of PG&#x02013;RCA to various molecular diagnostic assays.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The invention of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) notably changed biological research and diagnostics, since specific DNA sequence in genome can be amplified and detected with enormous sensitivity and specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Its applications to DNA cloning, genetic fingerprints, <italic>in vitro</italic> diagnostics and others have been already well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). However, PCR requires precise control of temperature cycling for successful DNA amplification, and the resultant instrumental restraint has been hampering its wider and more versatile applications (e.g. point-of-care use in hospitals and miniaturized systems for high-throughput analysis).</p><p>Accordingly, several isothermal amplification methods have been developed, which are free from these problems. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) utilizes circular single-stranded DNA probes as everlasting templates for DNA polymerization. Among several modes of RCA proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7">3&#x02013;7</xref>), the following two are especially well known. In linear rolling circle amplification (LRCA), circular probes are combined with sense primers, and long concatenated sequence copies of the circular probes are produced by DNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). No temperature cycling is required, however the signal amplification of LRCA is inherently linear and is not necessarily satisfactory. On the other hand, hyper-branched RCA (also known as ramification or cascade RCA) shows exponential signal amplification under isothermal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Here, circular probes (detection targets) are combined with a pair of sense and antisense primers and enormous amplification can be achieved. However, in either modes of RCA, in order to detect internal nucleic-acid sequences, circular probes must be obtained through circularization of padlock probes in separate reactions and it is difficult to conduct both reactions simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Also, there has been a controversy that padlock probes topologically linked on long linear single-stranded DNA might inhibit RCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>In this article, we developed a novel mode of RCA, dubbed primer generation&#x02013;RCA (PG&#x02013;RCA), in which nucleic-acid sequences of sample DNA are detected with high sensitivity and wide dynamic range. One of the distinctive advantages over conventional nucleic-acid amplification technologies is being free from troublesome design and usage of exogenous primers since &#x02018;primers&#x02019; are generated successively during the reaction. By simple design of circular probe and addition of nicking enzyme, conventional linear RCA was successfully converted to an exponential amplification mode without complicated topological factors. A remarkably high sensitivity and wide dynamic range, which are comparable to those of PCR, were obtained under isothermal conditions. Detection capability of low copy number of nucleic-acid sequences allows diverse applications of PG&#x02013;RCA in several various molecular diagnostic assays.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies or Sigma Genosys.

Under the same reaction condition, LRCA reaction is designed to produce long concatenated sequence copy of the circular probe and nicking reaction to generate multiple &#x02018;primers&#x02019; for the circular probe from the LRCA product, therefore those reactions continuously initiate each other until some of the reaction components, most likely dNTP substrates, are depleted. Also, as multiple reaction cycles can be initiated from a single cycle, PG&#x02013;RCA reaction accumulates LRCA products and &#x02018;primers&#x02019; in an exponential manner over a time.<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Reaction mechanism of PG&#x02013;RCA. PG&#x02013;RCA initiates from hybridization between a sample DNA and a circular probe (Step 1). Once a sample DNA and circular probe form a complex, DNA polymerase synthesizes a long concatenated sequence copy of the circular probe through linear rolling circle amplification (LRCA) (Step 2). Then, multiple circular probes hybridize to multiple sites of the LRCA product, and nicking enzyme recognition sequences of the LRCA product are activated by double strand formation (Step 3). Nicking enzyme recognizes and cleaves the recognition sequences and produces multiple complexes of a &#x02018;primer&#x02019; and circular probe (Step 4). Each complex can initiate the next round of PG&#x02013;RCA (go back to Step 2).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn1014f1"/></fig></p><p>PG&#x02013;RCA was demonstrated using Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase and thermostable strand specific nicking enzyme, Nb.BsmI. Circular probe I used in the reaction is a 72-base single-strand sequence and contains a complementary sequence to a 19-base specific 3&#x02032;-end sequence (sample DNA I) and a nicking site for Nb.BsmI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The reaction was conducted at 60&#x000b0;C for up to 120 min and the product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). With 500 amol sample DNA, smear and ladder DNA products were observed together over time, which could be LRCA products and its nicked fragments (&#x02018;primers&#x02019;), respectively. On the other hand, we did not observe such products without sample DNA, however smear and ladder products were observed as background amplification in a prolonged incubation, which will be discussed later.<fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Endpoint product analysis of PG&#x02013;RCA.

Lane M was loaded with a 100 bp DNA marker (100, 200, 300, 400, 500/517, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1200 and 1517 bp from the bottom).

Lane M is a 100 bp DNA marker.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn1014f2"/></fig></p><p>In order to confirm whether both DNA polymerase and nicking enzyme are required for PG&#x02013;RCA, the reaction was conducted without either of the enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Agarose gel analysis of the reaction shows that PG&#x02013;RCA products were observed only when both enzymes exist with sample DNA as expected from the reaction mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). When the reaction mixture contains only DNA polymerase, the reaction is expected to work as LRCA (linear amplification) and very little amount of product was observed here. Its amplification efficiency is not as great as PG&#x02013;RCA and its product is not abundant enough for SYBR gold staining used in the agarose gel analysis. This data suggests that simple addition of nicking enzyme to LRCA can convert linear amplification in LRCA to exponential amplification in PG&#x02013;RCA and enhance the amplification efficiency to a great extent.</p><p>Furthermore, the PG&#x02013;RCA product was digested by either of two restriction enzymes, BsmI and BbvCI, in order to confirm that the product was the expected concatenated sequence copy of circular probe I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). BsmI recognizes the same 7-base sequence as Nb.BsmI, which is used in PG&#x02013;RCA, while BbvCI recognizes a different 7-base sequence that is only found in the circular probe I (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). As both enzymes do not recognize single-strand DNA, excess amount of a 19-base oligonucleotide complementary to those nicking sites was supplemented during the digestion reaction. PG&#x02013;RCA product was successfully digested into a single small fragment whether BsmI or BbvCI was used. The small fragment was further analyzed by 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel analysis and found to be the same size as a linear 72-base circular probe precursor I (data not shown). These data indicate that PG&#x02013;RCA product is a concatenated sequence copy of the circular probe and we concluded that PG&#x02013;RCA is working as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.<fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Real-time product analysis of PG&#x02013;RCA.

To do that, we designed circular probe II and increased the number of sample DNA hybridization sequences and nicking enzyme recognition sequences to three per circular probe (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The PG&#x02013;RCA product with circular probe II contained mainly a smear DNA product and very little ladder product on 1.0% agarose gel analysis (data not shown). This is probably because the LRCA product from circular probe II has nicking sites every 22 bases and even the ladder products could look like smear. Instead, it was confirmed that the product contained a ladder product ranging from &#x0223c;22 bases, which is the expected smallest &#x02018;primer&#x02019;, on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel analysis (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time analysis of PG&#x02013;RCA</title><p>PG&#x02013;RCA reaction was monitored in real time by measuring the fluorescent intensity of the reaction reagent using circular probe II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The fluorescent intensity in each reaction remained rather constant in early stage of the reaction but abruptly increased at a certain reaction time due to the accumulation of the PG&#x02013;RCA product. These fluorescent intensity&#x02013;reaction time curves synchronized very well among triplicate experiments containing the same amount of sample DNA. Furthermore, the abrupt signal increases appeared earlier when the reaction contained larger amount of sample DNA. In order to quantitatively analyze PG&#x02013;RCA reactions, threshold time (<italic>T</italic><sub>T</sub>: the time when the fluorescent intensity exceeds an arbitrary threshold), was defined in analogy to threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>) in real-time PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and plotted against the amount of sample DNA in log scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). We obtained a good linearity between 500 and 0.5 amol sample DNA or four orders of magnitude in linear least squares fitting. PG&#x02013;RCA accumulated its products exponentially, and the slope of the fitting indicated that PG&#x02013;RCA products increased by 10-fold every 8.7 min. The detection limit of PG&#x02013;RCA was 58.4 zmol or 3.50 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> molecules of sample DNA by calculating from the intersection of the fitting and average <italic>T</italic><sub>T</sub> value of the negative controls, which showed background signal amplifications without sample DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Suppression of background signal amplification and improvement of detection limit</title><p>The negative control reactions containing only circular DNA probe, enzymes and dNTP substrates provided similar products to those of the positive control reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Apparently, the cascade reaction cycle of PG&#x02013;RCA was initiated even without sample DNA or any 3&#x02032;-end sequences. This false reaction initiation was as efficient as the reaction initiation by 58.3 zmol sample DNA (the detection limit described above).</p><p>In order to improve the limit of detection further, it is necessary to suppress the background signal amplification of PG&#x02013;RCA. Several concentrations of dNTP substrates, Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase and nicking enzyme, Nb.BsmI, were compared in the presence or absence of 500 zmol sample DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). It was found that decreasing the concentration of dNTP or Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase could increase the <italic>T</italic><sub>T</sub> values of the negative controls more significantly than those with 500 zmol sample DNA and improve the limit of detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B). At 400 &#x000b5;M dNTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) or 0.4 U Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), the <italic>T</italic><sub>T</sub> values of the positive and negative controls were almost identical. On the other hand, at reduced concentrations of dNTP substrates (0.4 &#x000b5;M in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) or Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase (0.02 U in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), the <italic>T</italic><sub>T</sub> value of the positive control was clearly smaller than that of the negative control, suggesting that the false reaction initiation in the negative control may be related with dNTP substrates and DNA polymerase. However, changing concentration of Nb.BsmI did not change the <italic>T</italic><sub>T</sub> values of the positive and negative controls at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). The reaction conditions were further optimized to improve the detection limit of PG&#x02013;RCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). At 0.4 &#x000b5;M dNTP, 1000-fold lower concentration than the original condition, Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase concentration was also reduced to differentiate the positive and negative controls even better, and we obtained the current optimized reaction condition of PG&#x02013;RCA: 0.4 &#x000b5;M dNTP and 0.05 U Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase.<fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Optimization of reaction conditions for PG&#x02013;RCA.

PG&#x02013;RCA can detect specific 3&#x02032;-end sequences just like LRCA, however PG&#x02013;RCA works in an exponential reaction mechanism and is much more sensitive than LRCA. After optimizing the reaction condition, we obtained a great sensitivity with detection limit of 84.5 ymol or 50.7 molecules of synthetic sample DNA and a large dynamic range of seven orders of magnitude, which is comparable to PCR and hyper-branched RCA. Furthermore, PG&#x02013;RCA is applicable to detection of internal DNA sequences containing nicking sites without compromising its sensitivity, and it was demonstrated that PG&#x02013;RCA can detect as low as 0.163 pg (&#x0223c;60 molecules) of genomic DNA from <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and distinguish clearly <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> genomic DNA from other bacterial DNA.</p><p>The background signal amplification of PG&#x02013;RCA was successfully suppressed by decreasing dNTP and DNA polymerase concentrations and the reaction sensitivity was improved by almost 700-fold from the original reaction condition, which is similar concentrations of dNTP and DNA polymerase to other nucleic-acid amplification reactions such as PCR and hyper-branched RCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We also confirmed that magnesium concentration affect the intensity of the background signal amplification (the optimum concentration: 4&#x02013;6 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>), presumably affecting the polymerase activity although Nb.BsmI also requires magnesium ions as cofactors. Different reaction temperatures, DNA polymerase inhibitors such as acyclonucleotide, triphophosphatesnucleotide triphosphates (NTPs), bicalin, genistin, <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide and reaction supplements such as single-strand binding protein (SSB), betaine and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were also tested to suppress the background signal amplification, however any of them did not selectively suppress the background signals of PG&#x02013;RCA.</p><p>The false initiation of PG&#x02013;RCA could be related with primer/template-independent polymerization, which has been reported for several thermophilic DNA polymerases including Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In one of the proposed reaction mechanisms, it is considered that DNA polymerase synthesizes short oligonucleotides from dNTP substrates without primer or template, and elongates palindrome sequences in the early oligonucleotide products to large DNA products by repeating self priming and strand displacement extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Also, it was reported that the reaction could be further accelerated by thermophilic DNA restriction enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). We observed that primer/template-independent polymerization or the dNTP substrates incubated with DNA polymerase increased the false initiation of PG&#x02013;RCA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1014/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). However, we ruled out the possibility that primer/template-independent polymerization is the background signal amplification itself because we did not observe any signal amplification at the optimized reaction condition, i.e. 0.4 &#x000b5;M dNTP and 0.05 U Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase, even after 10 h reaction without circular probes. Therefore, we propose the following mechanism for the false initiation of PG&#x02013;RCA: first, random short oligonucleotides are generated from dNTP substrates by primer/template-independent polymerization. Then, 3&#x02032;-ends of the oligonucleotides hybridize to circular probes non-specifically. DNA polymerase extends the 3&#x02032;-ends on the circular probes and initiates the reaction cycle of PG&#x02013;RCA without sample DNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1014/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>).</p><p>It is difficult to specify which reaction step dominates the overall PG&#x02013;RCA kinetics because of the complexity of the reaction mechanism, however it is possible to deduce which reaction factor is involved more significantly than the others by comparing the reaction kinetics at different reaction parameters. Reduction of dNTP and DNA polymerase concentrations significantly increased the <italic>T</italic><sub>T</sub> values of the positive control reactions or decreased those reaction speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B), while that of nicking enzyme did not affect the reaction speeds at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Therefore, at the reaction conditions we tested, the linear RCA reaction may control the reaction speed of PG&#x02013;RCA more significantly than the nicking reaction. We also speculate that circular probe concentration, which controls hybridization speed of circular probes to LRCA products, affects the reaction kinetics significantly as the reaction speed was maximum around 7.5&#x02013;15 nM circular probe and the reaction speed decreased out of this range (data not shown).</p><p><italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> genomic DNA detection using circular probe LM indicated that a short 26-base sequence with nicking enzyme recognition is specific enough to distinguish its <italic>hly</italic> gene sequence from other bacterial genomic DNA. Thus, PG&#x02013;RCA can target relatively short nucleotide regions as long as those include nicking sites, and should be advantageous especially when only limited nucleotide regions are available for detection such as heavily damaged genomic DNA samples.</p><p>PG&#x02013;RCA with circular probe LM required longer incubation than that with circular probe II, however amplification efficiency was similar by judging from the slopes of the least square fittings (&#x02212;19.1 and &#x02212;19.2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B). This may be because circular probe LM may have lower background amplification than circular probe II, while genomic DNA was less efficient to initiate PG&#x02013;RCA than synthetic sample DNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>PG&#x02013;RCA is useful to detect specific nucleic-acid sequences sensitively under isothermal conditions. Compared with PCR, no requirement of precise control of thermal cycling (thus no need of sophisticated thermal cyclers) should be a great advantage, especially in point-of-care molecular diagnostics and high-throughput systems. Comparing with other exponential nucleic-acid amplification reactions, PG&#x02013;RCA generates &#x02018;primers&#x02019; during the reaction, thereby being free from troublesome design and usage of exogenous primers. The reaction design of PG&#x02013;RCA is much simpler than the other isothermal amplification methods since the circular probe is required to have only primer hybridization and nicking sequences.</p><p>PG&#x02013;RCA is applicable to various molecular diagnostic assays by simply designing nucleic-acid probes to initiate the cascade reaction of PG&#x02013;RCA on target molecule recognition. For example, specific gene sequences of genomic DNA can be detected sensitively and specifically by PG&#x02013;RCA as long as the sequences include nicking sites. The same assay scheme may be applicable to specific RNA sequence detection since nicking reaction of DNA strands in DNA/RNA hybrids was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Alternatively, PG&#x02013;RCA can be combined with nucleic-acid probe technology such as cycling probe and invader probe to detect specific DNA or RNA sequences and generate specific 3&#x02032;-end sequence for PG&#x02013;RCA detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20">18&#x02013;20</xref>). When it is combined with aptamer or 3&#x02032;-end sequence-labeled antibody, PG&#x02013;RCA may be applicable to specific protein detection like immuno-RCA and proximity ligation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Furthermore, as PG&#x02013;RCA can distinguish relatively short nucleotide sequences specifically, highly multiplexed reaction may be possible by designing circular probes with different sequences around nicking sites to avoid cross reaction among those probes. Multiplex capacity may depend on the cross reactivity among circular probes when only a single nicking enzyme is used, however use of multiple nicking enzymes could increase the multiplex capacity further.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1014/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding for open access charge: Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
