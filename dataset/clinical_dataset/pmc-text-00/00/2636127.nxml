This policy was applied to all those trials which stared enrolment of the first subject on or after July 1, 2005.Their goal was very clear &#x02013; to have a comprehensive, publicly available database of all clinical trials. Later, many otherjournals which were not members of ICMJE also adopted a similar policy regarding the publication of clinical trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Though the idea of clinical trial registry is not new,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> ithas picked up momentum with the initiation of ICMJE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p><p>Why does a clinical trial need to be registered? The basic purpose of research is the advancement of science. Randomizedclinical trials (RCTs) are considered to be standards of evidence in the field of medicine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>Systematic reviews and meta-analysis of RCTs offer the best evidence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> However, their value getsdistorted due to non-publication of many trials due to various reasons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Negativeresults are usually under reported due to the author&#x02032;s dispiritedness, as well as editor&#x02032;s hesitancy to accept. Even ifall the trials were to be published, it has been shown that the trials with positive results are submitted much sooner after completionthan the trials with negative results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> There are many instances wherein company sponsoredtrials have been blocked from publication as the outcomes of these trials have not been favorable to the product of the sponsoringcompany.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Lack of complete transparency inclinical trials has lead to catastrophic situations in the past.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> Many studies are terminatedearly and are never reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> These actsare not only unethical on the part of the researchers, but also a betrayal of faith of the patients who participated in the trial withaltruism. Rapid disclosure of unfavorable trials could save many patients from losing their lives by stoppage of prescription ofharmful drugs. These trials need several grants which come from public funds. Not using the data available is therefore wastageof public money. Hence, it is essential to have transparency in research, so that scientists and the public at large, have access to allinformation and data. This will also avoid duplication of research and thereby prevent wastage of the limited resources availablefor research. Registration of clinical trials address all these issues in an effective manner.</p><p>Clinical trial registry is a not-for-profit endeavor. It should be open to all registrants free of charge. This data should beelectronically searchable and accessible to scientists, doctors, patients and the general public. When ICMJE took the initiativein 2005, there were five main clinical trials registry, the largest and most popular site being (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/">http://www.clinicaltrial.gov/</ext-link>). The WorldHealth Organization (WHO) also realized the importance of clinical trial registry and took initiative in collaborating the clinicaltrial registry internationally. Based on the ICMJE minimum requirement for data to be included in such a registry, the WHOhas developed the International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), which can integrate all primary and partner registersthat meet the WHO specified criteria. The Universal Trial Registry Number (UTRN) assigned by ICTRP helps in preventingduplication of trial registration. The aim of developing ICTRP was to provide a one-stop search portal for those who are lookingfor information about clinical trials. The WHO seeks information on 20 key items<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> prior toregistering a clinical trial and thesedetails should be disclosed before the enrolment of the 1<sup>st</sup> subject in the study. These items include (1) primary registerand trial identification number; (2) date of registration in primary register; (3) secondary identification number(s); (4) source(s) ofmonetary or material support; (5) primary sponsor; (6) secondary sponsor ; (7) contact for public queries; (8) contact for scientificqueries; (9) public title; (10) scientific title; (11) countries of recruitment; (12) health condition(s); (13) interventions; (14) keyinclusion and exclusion criteria; (15) study type; (16) date of first enrolment; (17) target sample size; (18) recruitment status; (19)primary outcome(s); and (20) key secondary outcomes.</p><p>Many countries support the clinical trial registry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> and India is not lagging behind in this context. Indian Council of MedicalResearch (ICMR) in collaboration with Department of Science &#x00026; Technology (DST) and WHO took the initiative in this regard andlaunched the Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI) on 20<sup>th</sup> July, 2007 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ctri.in/">http://www.ctri.in/</ext-link>. The CTRI is hosted at the National Institute ofMedical Statistics (NIMS), ICMR, New Delhi, and is a free online registry of clinical trials being conducted in India. This registryis based on WHO&#x02032;s guidelines and is compatible with ICTRP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> In addition to the WHO items of registration data, the CTRI alsorequires declaration of few additional items at the time of registration which are (1)Principal Investigator&#x02032;s Name and Address,(2) Name of the Ethics Committee and approval status, (3) Regulatory Clearance obtained from DCGI, (4) Estimated duration oftrial, (5) Site/s of study, (6) Phase of Trial, (7) Brief Summary, (8) Method of generating randomization sequence, (9) Method ofallocation concealment, (10) Blinding and masking.</p><p>The types of clinical trials that need to be registered have been clearly specified by the WHO and adopted by ICMJE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>and includes &#x02033;any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes&#x02033;. It was further elaborated by Laine <italic>etal</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> to &#x02033;health-relatedinterventions include any intervention used to modify a biomedical or health-related outome (e.g., drugs, surgical procedures,devices, behavioral treatments, dietary interventions and process-of-care changes). Health outcomes include any biomedical orhealth-related measures obtained in patients or participants, including pharmacokinetic measures and adverse events.&#x02033; Purelyobservational studies, wherein the assignment of intervention is not at the discretion of the researchers, are not required to beregistered. If an individual is not sure whether a particular study needs registration, it is advisable to err on the side of cautionand register, especially if the authors wish for the study to be considered for possible publication, particularly in those journalswhich follow the ICMJE guidelines for trial registration.</p><p>The editorial team of Indian Journal of Ophthalmology (IJO) is committed to quality. Therefore, we have joined hands withleading journals of the country in publishing a joint statement on this issue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> and state thatunregistered clinical trials may not beconsidered for publication after January 2010 in IJO. Through this editorial, I urge all researchers to comply with this requirementto maintain the high standard set by peers in scientific publication.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><date-in-citation>(accessed on April 5, 2008)</date-in-citation><source>Clinical trial registration: a statement from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.</source><comment>Available: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icmje.org/clin_trial.pdf/">http://www.icmje.org/clin_trial.pdf/</ext-link></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Laine</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Horton</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>DeAngelis</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><name><surname>Drazen</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Frizella</surname><given-names>FA</given-names></name><name><surname>Godlee F et</surname><given-names>al</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical trial registration: looking back and moving ahead</article-title><source>CMAJ</source><year>2007</year><volume>177</volume><fpage>57</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17548376</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Simes</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Publication bias : the case for an international registry of clinical trials</article-title><source>J Clin Oncol</source><year>1986</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>1529</fpage><lpage>41</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3760920</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Calmers</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Unbiased, relevant, and reliable assessments in health care : important progress during the past century, but plenty ofscope for doing better</article-title><source>BMJ</source><year>1998</year><volume>317</volume><fpage>1167</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9794844</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dickersin</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Rennie</surname><given-names>Drummond</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Registering Clinical Trials</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2003</year><volume>290</volume><fpage>516</fpage><lpage>23</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12876095</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dickersin</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Manheimer</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Wieland</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Lefebvre</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>McDonald</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Development of the Cochrane Collaboration?s CENTRAL registerof controlled clinical trials</article-title><source>Eval Health Prof</source><year>2002</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>38</fpage><lpage>64</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11868444</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ionnidis</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effects of the statistical significance of results on the time of completion and publication of randomized efficacytrials</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>1998</year><volume>279</volume><fpage>281</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9450711</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref8"><label>8</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Curfman</surname><given-names>GD</given-names></name><name><surname>Morrissey</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Drazen</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Expression of concern : Bombardier <italic>et al</italic>. &#x02033;Comparison of upper gastrointestinal toxicity ofrofecoxib and naproxen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,&#x02033;
