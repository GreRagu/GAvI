The most advanced class of these probes was generated by molecular fusion of the voltage sensing domain (VSD) of Ci-VSP with a fluorescent protein (FP) pair. We quantitatively compared the three most advanced versions of these probes (two previously reported and one new variant), each involving a spectrally distinct tandem of FPs. Despite these different FP tandems and dissimilarities within the amino acid sequence linking the VSD to the FPs, the amplitude and kinetics of voltage dependent fluorescence changes were surprisingly similar. However, each of these fluorescent probes has specific merits when considering different potential applications.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the last decade, several designs of genetically-encoded optical probes for membrane potential have been explored but only one design, referred to as VSFPs, has been proven to provide a reliable voltage report in mammalian cells so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004555-Sakai1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004555-Baker1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

The only striking difference was that the response component with the fast &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; time constant contributed to a larger fraction of the total signal in VSFP2.4 as compared to Mermaid (40&#x000b1;4&#x00025; versus 23&#x000b1;5&#x00025; at &#x0002b;60 mV). Accordingly, the initial &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; response was faster in VSFP2.4 as compared to Mermaid (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004555-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Fluorescence decay upon return to V<sub>H</sub> (i.e. <bold>&#x003c4;</bold><sub>off</sub>) was fitted with a single time constant which did not differ between the probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004555-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p><p>The &#x00394;F/F values of FRET-based FP sensors depend on many factors but the conceptually most straightforward are the spectral overlap between donor emission and acceptor absorbance and the acceptor extinction coefficient. Critical structural parameters include the transition dipole baseline orientation and its modulation by the probe activation. These factors are difficult to predict from available structural data since it is likely that the different FPs used within the three VSFP2.1 variants have a different dipole orientation relative to their secondary structure. Indeed, it is well established that single amino acid substitutions linking the components of the fusion proteins can have dramatic effects on &#x00394;F values of calcium sensors (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004555-Souslova1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>). Therefore, it was quite surprising to find a relatively modest difference in the response properties among the VSFP2.1 variants. Thus, their voltage-dependent donor dequenching was very similar and the observed differences in acceptor modulation can be explained by photophysical differences between the corresponding FP. For instance, a slightly larger modulation of the acceptor fluorescence in Mermaid was anticipated from reduced direct acceptor excitation when exciting the donor. Although modest, these differences may along with emerging computational approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004555-Pham1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> drive further enhancements of this class of membrane voltage probes. Furthermore, the absence of difference in response time constants of the three VSFP2.1 variants tested in this study was expected because of the very similar general design of the probes, which therefore leads to tracking of the same conformational changes with different FP tandems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004555-VillalbaGalea1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the striking difference in the contribution of the two &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; time constants demonstrated the importance of probe &#x0201c;fine tuning&#x0201d; at the level of single amino acid.</p><p>Direct comparison of the three variants was made possible using spectrally resolved &#x00394;F/F measurements. We therefore propose that this method should be used in future to provide definitive evidence of sensor improvements since this measure depends much less on a particular set of filters.</p><p>Most conceivable applications of VSFP2.1 type probes for membrane potential will be based on standard imaging which requires the use of band pass filters to select appropriate spectral ranges for donor and acceptor channels. The spectral responses can be multiplied by the transmission spectrum of candidate filters to conveniently predict &#x00394;F/F values and shot noise characteristics. For example, comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004555-g002">Fig. 2</xref> with 3 reveals that the standard filters used for CFP and YFP were suboptimal (in terms of maximizing &#x00394;F/F values) in the case of VSFP2.3. Although each VSFP2.1 variant showed a significant component of donor emission in the acceptor channel, this problem was most pronounced in the case of the CFP/YFP pair since the two other variants exhibited a larger separation of donor and acceptor emission spectra.</p><p>Our data indicate that each of the three membrane voltage probes has specific merits. VSFP2.3 is based on the most widely used FP pair and hence is suitable for instrumentation with standard optical components. The well balanced absolute fluorescence and dynamic range of donor and acceptor makes Mermaid a good candidate for dual emission (i.e. ratiometric) measurements. Limitations of Mermaid are the relatively low fluorescence quantum yield and high bleaching rate of the used FPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004555-Tsutsui1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> as well as a reduced contribution of the fast &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; response component. Another yet to be solved problem with Mermaid is its tendency to form fluorescent aggregates. In experimental configurations where single emission approaches and fast response times are preferred (e.g. based on signal-to-noise consideration), VSFP2.4 (using the YFP channel) is likely the best choice. The far-red channel of this variant could be the best option if green tissue autofluorescence or light absorption by hemoglobin is an issue (e.g. as in <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging). Furthermore, the spectral properties of VSFP2.4 will facilitate deep tissue imaging using two-photon excitation microscopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Molecular Biology</title><p>The VSFP2.3 construct was generated as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004555-Lundby1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Photonics) through a 50&#x000d7;oil immersion objective. For spectral measurements fluorescence emission was collected through the objective and directed via a first dichroic mirror (465 nm for VSFP2.3, 495 nm for VSFP2.4 and Mermaid) to a fiber optic port of a fluorescence spectrometer (Fluorolog, HORIBA) equipped with a back illuminated cooled CCD camera. For dual channel measurements emission light was splited by a secondary dichroic mirror onto two photodiodes (T.I.L.L. Photonics) behind badpass filters as specified. Optical filters sets: VSFP2.3, excitation 440 nm hw 6 nm, dichroic 1 (465 nm), dichroic 2 (505 nm), emission Cerulean LP 480 nm, emission Citrine 515 nm; VSFP2.4, excitation 490 nm hw 6 nm, dichroic 1 (506 nm), emission LP 514 nm, dichroic 2 (580 nm), emission Citrine 520&#x000b1;35 nm, emission mKate2 625&#x000b1;25 nm; Mermaid, excitation 460 nm hw 6 nm, dichroic 1 (495 nm), emission LP 480 nm, dichroic 2 (560 nm) (Semrock). Photodiode signals were digitized along with the electrophysiological signals using Axon hard- and software described above.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>The fluorescence and electrophysiological signals were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments) and Origin software (OriginLab, Northhampton, MA, USA). Photobleaching (typically less than 0.1&#x00025;/s) was corrected by subtraction of a linear fit of the bleaching curve. Fluorescence signals were &#x0201c;background corrected&#x0201d; by subtracting offsets measured from regions devoid of cells. This offset corresponds to reflected and unblocked excitation light and any probe-independent fluorescence within the optical path. Fluorescence transients (F(t)) were fitted with a double exponential function of the form F(t)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;F<sub>baseline</sub>&#x0002b;&#x00394;Ffast &#x000b7; exp(&#x02212;t/<bold>&#x003c4;</bold>fast)&#x0002b;&#x00394;Fslow exp(&#x02212;t/<bold>&#x003c4;</bold>slow).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004555.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Spectral properties of fluorescent proteins used in VSFP2.4.
