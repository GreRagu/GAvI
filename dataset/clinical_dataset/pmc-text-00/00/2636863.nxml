In fact, the fractions of genes under differential growth phase-dependent translational control in the two species <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic> and <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic> were as high as in eukaryotes. However, nothing is known about the mechanisms of translational regulation in archaea. Therefore, two genes exhibiting opposing directions of regulation were selected to unravel the importance of untranslated regions (UTRs) for differential translational control <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Differential translational regulation in exponentially growing versus stationary phase cells was studied by comparing translational efficiencies using a reporter gene system. Translational regulation was not observed when 5&#x02032;-UTRs or 3&#x02032;-UTRs alone were fused to the reporter gene. However, their simultaneous presence was sufficient to transfer differential translational control from the native transcript to the reporter transcript. This was true for both directions of translational control. Translational regulation was completely abolished when stem loops in the 5&#x02032;-UTR were changed by mutagenesis. An &#x0201c;UTR-swap&#x0201d; experiment demonstrated that the direction of translational regulation is encoded in the 3&#x02032;-UTR, not in the 5&#x02032;-UTR. While much is known about 5&#x02032;-UTR-dependent translational control in bacteria, the reported findings provide the first examples that both 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-UTRs are essential and sufficient to drive differential translational regulation in a prokaryote and therefore have to functionally interact <italic>in vivo</italic>. The current results indicate that 3&#x02032;-UTR-dependent translational control had already evolved before capping and polyadenylation of transcripts were invented, which are essential for circularization of transcripts in eukaryotes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein biosynthesis is comprised of three steps: initiation, elongation and termination of translation.

A global analysis of translationally regulated genes of the two archaeal species <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic> and <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic> revealed that 20&#x00025; of all genes of the former and 6&#x00025; of the latter species showed growth phase-dependent differential translational regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004484-Lange1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

A reporter gene system was used that had been established recently to characterize translation initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004484-Brenneis1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. It turned out that it is also well suited analyze growth phase-dependent translational regulation. For both genes, which exemplify two opposite directions of differential translational control, it could be successfully demonstrated that the simultaneous presence of both 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-UTR is necessary and sufficient to transfer growth phase dependent translational regulation from the native transcript to the reporter transcript. In contrast, neither 5&#x02032;- nor 3&#x02032;-UTR alone are sufficient for regulation. This observation implies a functional interaction of the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-UTR <italic>in vivo</italic>. To our knowledge this is the first such evidence for any bacterial or archaeal species.</p><p>In eukaryotes circularization of specific transcripts has been shown about 10 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004484-Tarun1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004484-Wells1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The circularization is thought to be caused by the common interaction of the cap-binding protein eIF4E and the polyA tail binding protein (PABP) with the scaffolding protein eIF4G. The ternary eIF4E/eIF4G/PABP complex has been reconstituted and using atomic force microscopy it could be shown that it is able to circularize capped, polyadenylated RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004484-Wells1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, haloarchaea do not contain orthologs of eIF4E and PABP. Therefore, it seems that functional interactions of transcript ends has evolved prior to the development of mRNA capping and polyadenylation. Archaea contain a variety of translation initiation factors that are homologous to eukaryotic factors and that are not present in bacteria, which have only three initiation factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004484-Londei1">&#x0005b;review: 27&#x0005d;</xref>.

Again, to our knowledge this is the first evidence for such a role of 3&#x02032;-UTRs in any bacterial or archaeal species. In recent years it became apparent that translational control plays an important role also in bacteria. Regulation occurs at the translation initiation step, which is rate-limiting. The mechanisms typically involve sequences around the initiation site in the 5&#x02032;-UTR, often differentially occluding the SD sequence from the ribosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004484-Kozak1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.
