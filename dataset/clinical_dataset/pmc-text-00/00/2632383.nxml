All drugs with proven antipsychotic effects block dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors to some degree. The ongoing development of the dopamine and other neurotransmitter receptor systems during childhood and adolescence may affect clinical response and susceptibility to side effects in youth. A literature search was conducted of clinical trials of antipsychotics in children and adolescents with EOSS disorders between 1980 and 2007 from the Medline database, reference lists, and conference proceedings. Trials were limited to double-blind studies of duration of 4 or more weeks that included 15 or more patients. Ten clinical trials were identified. Antipsychotic medications were consistently found to reduce the severity of psychotic symptoms in children and adolescents when compared with placebo. The superiority of clozapine has been now demonstrated relative to haloperidol, standard-dose olanzapine, and &#x0201c;high-dose&#x0201d; olanzapine for EOSS disorders. However, limited comparative data are available regarding whether there are differences among the remaining second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) in clinical effectiveness. The available data from short-term studies suggest that youth might be more sensitive than adults to developing antipsychotic-related adverse side effects (eg, extrapyramidal side effects, sedation, prolactin elevation, weight gain). In addition, preliminary data suggest that SGA use can lead to the development of diabetes in some youth, a disease which itself carries with it significant morbidity and mortality. Such a substantial risk points to the urgent need to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent and/or mitigate weight gain and diabetes early in the course of treatment in this population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>psychosis</kwd><kwd>atypical antipsychotic</kwd><kwd>weight management</kwd><kwd>metabolic syndrome</kwd><kwd>cognitive deficits</kwd><kwd>double-blind treatment trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Many clinicians view schizophrenia in childhood or adolescence as relatively rare; however, this belief is not fully accurate. Although the prevalence of childhood-onset schizophrenia (onset of psychotic symptoms before 13 years of age) is indeed very low (approximately 1/100 cases of schizophrenia),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref> the incidence of schizophrenia rises sharply at about 12&#x02013;14 years of age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref> Before 18 years of age, approximately 12%&#x02013;33% of individuals with schizophrenia would develop the onset of their illness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref> and thus would be classified as having an early-onset schizophrenia-spectrum (EOSS) disorder.</p><p>When <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third/Fourth Edition</italic> (<italic>DSM-III/IV</italic>), criteria are rigorously applied, clinical and neurobiological studies have demonstrated a number of phenomenological similarities in the presentation of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (ie, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder) in children/adolescents and adults with regard to the relative frequency of core psychotic symptoms (eg, auditory hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder), neurocognitive impairments, psychophysiological abnormalities, and the presence of structural brain abnormalities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref> In comparison to adults with schizophrenia, there is an increased rate of premorbid abnormalities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref> and a rarity of well-formulated delusions reported by children/adolescents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref> EOSS disorder patients frequently manifest early impairments in expressive language, motor function, and transient symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder well in advance of the first onset of psychotic symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref> However, children with EOSS disorder and autistic disorder can be distinguished on the basis of developmental history, clinical features, family history, and age at onset.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref> Higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity in EOSS disorder (ie, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and major depressive disorder) appear to be another important developmental difference between adults and youth with schizophrenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref> However, in children/adolescents pharmacological treatment of these comorbid conditions is rare that may reflect a lack of empirically driven guidelines for appropriate treatment and/or the hierarchical diagnostic system that is characteristic of <italic>DSM-IV</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref> It is important to note that psychotic symptoms are not specific to schizophrenia, and the differential diagnosis of EOSS disorder would include substance abuse, mood and anxiety disorders, and various medical conditions (eg, seizure disorders, infectious disease, metabolic and endocrine disorders, central nervous system lesions, etc). Also, there are a sizable number of children and adolescents with subsyndromal conditions who report psychotic symptoms that would not meet the severity/duration criteria required by <italic>DSM-IV</italic> to qualify for a diagnosis of schizophrenia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></p><p>Naturalistic data show that EOSS disorder is a chronic, disabling disease, which, in the majority of cases, requires long-term antipsychotic medication treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref> Studies of antipsychotic medications in adults with chronic schizophrenia may provide guidance for the treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia, but the treatment of pediatric patients has unique developmental aspects. To date, all the drugs with proven antipsychotic effects block dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors to some degree. Although the pathophysiology of schizophrenia remains unclear, it has been hypothesized that increased dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesolimbic pathways produces the positive symptoms of the disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref> Based on this working hypothesis, it is thought that antipsychotic medications work by blocking dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors, thus dampening psychotic symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref> Preclinical studies suggest that there are substantial changes occurring within the dopamine system and other neurotransmitter systems during mid to late adolescence in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in normative development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref> that may have implications for understanding the mechanism of onset of schizophrenia that typically occurs during late adolescence and early adulthood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref> The specific maturational changes in the dopamine receptor system include decreases in dopamine cell density<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>; peaking of basal dopamine levels,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref> dopamine turnover,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref> and dopaminergic PFC input<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>; and changes in D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptor concentrations in the striatum.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref> Overall, these data suggest that, relative to adulthood, adolescence is characterized by increases in basal PFC dopamine levels. These maturational changes in the dopamine receptor system (as well as other neurotransmitter systems) during childhood and adolescence could potentially have implications for clinical response as well as an increased susceptibility to side effects (eg, extrapyramidal side effects [EPS], prolactin elevation, sedation, weight gain) observed in youth exposed to antipsychotic drugs.</p><p>Aside from making the initial diagnosis, choice of antipsychotic is probably the most important decision that a child and adolescent psychiatrist makes in collaborating with the patient/family in treating a young patient with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder. Over the past few years, second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have been preferred over first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) in the treatment of EOSS disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref> However, increasing concerns about the adverse side effects associated with SGA treatment in children and adolescents point to the need to reexamine the risk/benefit of these agents. This descriptive review aims to systematically examine the evidence from randomized, double-blind comparison studies supporting the use of antipsychotics in EOSS disorder. The implications of recent treatment research are discussed including the identification of high priority areas for future research in this population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHOD</title><p>A systematic literature search using the Medline database was performed to identify all random assignment, controlled pediatric clinical trials of antipsychotics in children and adolescents with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders whose results were published in the peer-reviewed literature from 1970 to 2007.

There have been no long-term studies demonstrating the safety of FGAs in children, and thus, data must be extrapolated from adult studies. Case reports of antipsychotic-related tardive dyskinesia (TD) have been reported in adults and children for all the available antipsychotics, including the SGAs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref> In adults, TD is of particular concern, with an incidence of approximately 5% per year of FGA exposure and a spontaneous remission rate of 2.5%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref> In 2 large adult studies, the incidence of TD over 5 years was 20%&#x02013;25%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref> In addition, adult data suggest that FGAs appear to have minimal benefit for neurocognitive symptoms in comparison to SGAs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref> However, it remains unclear to what extent the improvements in cognition demonstrated for SGAs in adult studies reflect normalization of cognitive deficits, practice effects, lack of inclusion of a healthy control group in some studies, or reduced burden of EPS.</p></sec><sec><title>Second-Generation Antipsychotics</title><p>The current published practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref> does not address the question of which antipsychotic to prescribe as a first-line agent for patients based on phase of illness, severity of clinical symptoms, and side effect risk. Concerns about the safety and lack of efficacy of the FGAs prompted a search for more effective agents with better tolerability. As a class, SGAs have affinity for both dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors as well as for serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>2</sub> and include clozapine, risperidone (and its active metabolite paliperidone), olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref> In addition, aripiprazole, another novel antipsychotic that is a partial dopamine agonist, is often classified as an SGA.

However, as with FGA agents, each of the SGAs tends to be more prone to certain adverse effects that exist along a spectrum.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref> These side effects appear directly related to the unique receptor-binding profiles of each of the SGAs. For example, some SGAs (eg, quetiapine, clozapine) rapidly dissociate from the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref> possibly allowing normal surges in dopamine to overcome receptor blockade in the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways. In contrast, aripiprazole acts as a selective partial agonist at the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref> These unique features may result in the lower EPS liability and minimal effects on prolactin levels of clozapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole compared with other SGAs such as risperidone in children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref> Whether the improved tolerability of the SGAs will enhance treatment adherence in children and adolescents with EOSS disorder remains an important, but unanswered question.</p><p>Nonadherence to treatment is a widespread phenomenon among youth with schizophrenia, due to such factors as impaired cognition, lack of insight, and side effects associated with antipsychotic treatment.

For these reasons and due to the relative rarity of EOSS disorder, it has been difficult to conduct systematic, long-term studies of the safety of clozapine treatment in children/adolescents. However, there are some long-term safety data for clozapine. In a retrospective chart review of 172 hospitalized children with serious emotional disturbances treated with clozapine (median observation period 8 months), the cumulative probability of developing a hematological adverse event (mainly neutropenia) over a 1-year period was 16.1%, which seems somewhat higher than what typically has been reported in adult studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">85</xref> However, the probability of developing agranulocytosis in this pediatric sample was 0.99%, which is comparable to that observed in adult studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">85</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Weight Gain and Metabolic Side Effects Associated With SGA Treatment</title><p>Weight gain has emerged as one of the most significant and problematic side effects for children and adolescents treated with SGAs and a significant barrier to treatment adherence.

In some cases, children and adolescents can be managed with nonpharmacological therapy directed at minimizing the occurrence of these adverse events (eg, nutritional counseling). However, when these problems are severe or fail to respond to behavioral interventions, clinicians frequently contemplate a change in antipsychotic medication and/or the addition of a weight-loss agent (possible agents that have been put forward include metformin, orlistat, amantidine, and sibutramine). However, this is an area in which further research is needed.

In particular, most of the studies reviewed herein have focused on short-term reductions in symptomatic outcomes and have not measured functional outcomes. Also, there has been a dearth of information regarding the utility of adjunctive psychosocial treatments and there have been relatively few head-to-head comparisons of currently available SGAs. In addition, there is a clear need for studies that examine the mechanisms by which antipsychotics medication work in pediatric populations and studies of interventions designed to address important adverse events such as antipsychotic-induced weight gain.</p><p>To date, a major obstacle to conducting informative treatment studies in EOSS disorder has been subject recruitment. There are a number of reasons for this problem that have been examined in detail elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref> For example, substance misuse is a frequent comorbidity in youth with schizophrenia, and it is difficult to determine that psychotic symptoms are not substance induced particularly when treatment needs to be initiated symptomatically. Thus, these patients may not be included in clinical trials. The problem of subject recruitment has been overcome in recent industry and federally sponsored trials with the use of multisite studies. In addition, we would argue that intervention studies in this population should consider incorporating features of both efficacy and effectiveness trial designs. For example, although for scientific reasons it may be preferable to exclusively focus on patients with schizophrenia who do not require the addition of mood-stabilizing drugs, a sizable proportion of children and adolescents with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders present while taking such medications and acutely tapering them prior to randomization could destabilize them, jeopardize their safety, and/or prevent their retention in a clinical trial. Thus, consideration should be given to designing protocols that include patients who have been on stable doses of such medications for at least 30 days and permit continuing them throughout the study. Lastly, the inclusion of a psychosocial treatment as a platform could enhance subject recruitment and retention.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>A substantial proportion of individuals who develop schizophrenia will have the onset of their illness during early adolescence. An early onset of psychosis bodes poorly for prognosis, with an increased likelihood of chronic, treatment-resistant symptoms and disability. Until recently, there were few well-controlled treatment trials that focused on the treatment of EOSS disorder. There is an emerging consensus that aripiprazole and risperidone are effective drugs for the first-line treatment of acute exacerbation of psychosis in adolescents with schizophrenia, and both drugs may soon have a formal FDA indication for this population. Initial data had suggested that the olanzapine and risperidone were clinically more effective than a high-potency FGA, haloperidol, in adolescents with psychosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref> However, as seen in the CATIE trial in adults,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref> emerging data from TEOSS suggest that these differences are probably not clinically significant and that a substantial proportion of youth with schizophrenia respond poorly to currently available first-line antipsychotic treatments.
