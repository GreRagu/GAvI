Significant progress has been achieved in qualitative investigations of signaling peptides in the nervous system using single cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. However, quantitative information about signaling peptides is difficult to obtain with this approach because only small amounts of analytes are available for analysis.

Comparative analysis of the C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> peptide release site, the upper labial nerve, and its synthesis location, the F- and C-clusters, shows that the release site possesses almost three times more of this compound. The method of standard addition permits absolute quantitation of the physiologically active neuropeptide cerebrin from small structures, including nerves and neuronal clusters, in the femtomole range with a limit of detection of 19 fmol.

Linking neurochemistry and brain function requires an understanding of the cell&#x02212;cell signaling peptides (SPs) used in the brain. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) and electrospray ionization (ESI) MS have become the technologies of choice for qualitative investigations of the peptide content in a brain sample. Neuropeptidomics, the detailed investigation of endogenous peptides in the brain and peripheral nervous system, continues to evolve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> (for reviews, see refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>)). Optimized sampling, extraction, and data-analysis methods are now available for following the multistep processing of prohormones into biologically active peptides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup></p><p>Although these approaches are more useful for homogeneous populations of cells, in the nervous system even adjacent neurons have significantly different biochemical profiles that include unique SP complements. The microliter or larger volumes of nervous tissue used for neuropeptidome studies contain hundreds of thousands of cells. As the individual neurons comprising pooled samples can contain unique complements of SPs that are involved in functionally antagonistic networks, averaging the SP content from hundreds of thousands of neurons makes understanding the functional consequences of this neuropeptide complexity difficult. Furthermore, the increased dynamic range inherent to such complex mixtures places constraints on analytical measurement systems. In contrast, interpretation of results is easier when performing qualitative and quantitative microanalyses of individual cells or small representative tissue areas. Not only are these smaller samples chemically simpler, the putative functions of the detected peptides are not obscured by the other cell contents present in larger samples.</p><p>In systems biology research, with its emphasis on obtaining, integrating, and interpreting chemical, spatial, and temporal information, investigation of individual cells has become an important focus. With the use of mass spectrometric technologies, tremendous gains in the qualitative measurement of peptides from individual neurons have been made.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> MALDI, in particular, has proven valuable in single cell studies by offering high sensitivity, low sample consumption, relatively simple sample preparation, and the ability to investigate small-volume samples over a broad dynamic range. MS-based investigations have enabled a range of prohormones and unusual post-translational modifications to be characterized in a number of invertebrate neuronal model systems, most notably in mollusks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> and arthropods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Single cell MALDI MS recently has been used to investigate mammalian cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> and several reports have demonstrated the ability to perform MS peptide sequencing using single cell samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup></p><p>Clearly, obtaining qualitative information on signaling molecules at the single cell level is relevant to understanding their function but so also is the acquisition of quantitative information. For example, we would expect behavioral changes to be influenced by neurotransmitter and neuromodulator levels; in point of fact, we recently reported that serotonin levels in the soma of an identified neuron from <italic>Pleurobranchaea californica</italic> varied quantitatively according to the animal&#x02019;s hunger state.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) Several microanalytical methods are available for quantitative single cell measurements and include, among others, electrophoresis, immunohistochemistry, radioisotope labeling, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (see refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) for detailed descriptions of these technologies). Although a number of approaches for assaying individual cells are available, most are less suitable for measuring multiple compounds simultaneously. This is especially true when examining SPs in individual cells because of the wide range of concentrations, varied physicochemical properties of the peptides, high levels of biochemical and morphological compartmentalization in cells, and exceptional complexity of the intracellular and extracellular matrixes. Another issue is that SPs typically are packed in dense core vesicles, which must be lysed for quantitative analysis.</p><p>Mass spectrometric methods are often used to obtain quantitative or semiquantitative information on a variety of analytes. A number of elegant MS-based approaches have been demonstrated in recent years that use in situ, in vitro, and in vivo isotope labeling of analytes with <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>18</sup>O, iTRAQ, ICTL, SILAC, MCAT, <italic>d</italic>0- and <italic>d</italic>4-succinic anhydride-, and Ji et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> How well do these approaches work in neuropeptide investigations? The studies by Desiderio et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>) and others(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>) detail quantitative measurement of neuropeptides, as do more recent approaches using a range of sample sizes, isotope labeling strategies, and mass analyzers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup></p><p>However, even though these quantitative peptide measurement approaches have been well validated, it is uncertain if they may be suitable for minute-volume samples such as individual subcellular regions, single cells, and small tissue regions.

A 1% protease type IX in ASW-antibiotics solution treatment for 60&#x02212;120 min (depending on animal size) at 34 &#x000b0;C was used to reduce adherence between cells such as glia and neurons. This treatment also helps to remove connective tissue surrounding the ganglia and nerves as well as improves the success of individual neuron isolation. After the protease treatment, the ganglia were washed in ASW and stored in 33% glycerol/67% ASW (v/v) solution at 14 &#x000b0;C until use. This solution helps to stabilize cells during storage and neuron isolation.

Mass calibration was performed internally using one or more of the following approaches: using known endogenous peptides, adding angiotensin I to the MALDI matrix, and externally by applying Bruker&#x02019;s Peptide Calibration Standard II to the target. For those experiments using angiotensin I, 160 fmol was deposited on a spot for quantitation of single cells and small pieces of cerebral commissure. The angiotensin I amount was increased 10-fold when extracts of F- and C-clusters and upper labial (ULAB) nerves were characterized.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Peptide Extraction and Stable Isotope Labeling</title><p>F- and C-clusters and the ULAB nerves were dissected from a cerebral ganglion preparation (for description of cerebral ganglion morphology see ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>) and Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and separately incubated in 50 &#x003bc;L of extraction media containing 2:2:1 water/methanol/acetic acid overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. Unlike larger samples, homogenization and sonication were not required for efficient analyte extraction. The extracts were used in stable isotope labeling experiments where the amino groups, including free peptide N-termini and lysine residues, were isotopically labeled with <italic>d</italic>0- or <italic>d</italic>4-succinic anhydride. As a result, masses of labeled peptides increased by 100<italic>X</italic> Da when a light form of succinic anhydride was added, and by 104<italic>X</italic> Da when a heavy form was added (<italic>X</italic> represents the number of residues labeled). The labeling procedure used is similar to one described by Che et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>) with several modifications. Briefly, a 20-&#x003bc;L aliquot of each sample was supplemented with 70 &#x003bc;L of water, 5 &#x003bc;L of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8), and 4 &#x003bc;L of 1 M NaOH. Either 1 &#x003bc;L of 2 M <italic>d</italic>0- or of <italic>d</italic>4-succinic anhydride in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to the mixtures and allowed to react for 20 min at room temperature. Next, 1 &#x003bc;L of 1 M NaOH was added to the mixture to maintain a pH of &#x0223c;9. The addition of the succinic anhydride solution, the 20-min incubation period, and the pH adjustment steps were repeated two more times. Quenching of unreacted compounds was performed using 10 &#x003bc;L of 2.5 M glycine in water. Because several components, such as high levels of inorganic salts and DMSO, can interfere with the MALDI measurement, an additional peptide purification step is often required. Therefore, mixtures of 5 &#x003bc;L of labeled ULAB and 5 &#x003bc;L of labeled F- and C-cluster samples were cleaned with ZipTip pipet tips packed with 0.6 &#x003bc;L of C<sub>18</sub> resin (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Analytes were eluted from the ZipTip pipet tip with 2 &#x003bc;L of CHCA solution onto a prespotted AnchorChip MALDI sample plate (Bruker Daltonics). The AnchorChip&#x02019;s hydrophobic surface reduced sample spreading and therefore increased analyte concentration, yielding higher quality and more consistent data.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>An <italic>Aplysia californica</italic> cerebral ganglion has a well defined but complex structural organization.

The last two operations have to be done quickly due to the evaporation of organic solvent. No cleanup of samples using a solid phase extraction material was performed.

Next, the samples were reconstituted with acidified methanol containing synthetic cerebrin as an internal calibrant. Repetitive cycles of MS measurement, reconstitution/addition of the calibrant and drying, followed by a new MS measurement, allowed the construction of a calibration curve for quantitative measurement of cerebrin in the sample. Importantly, to build this calibration curve, the intensity of the endogenous cerebrin signal detected in control measurements was subtracted from the total signal representing endogenous and spiked cerebrin. Also, intensities of cerebrin and cerebrin sodium adduct peaks were normalized to the intensities of the internal standard signals and intensity values summed. The best-fit line through the calibration curve was used, and the amount of endogenous peptide was determined. In all cases, standard deviations of the measurements are presented.

As with other neurosecretory cells, AI- and cerebrin-expressing neurons produce significant amounts of intercellular signaling peptides. Despite the multicellular nature of these structures, their relative sizes are small (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), typically, several tens to hundreds of micrometers across in the longest direction. For example, the cerebral commissure and ULAB nerves have well-developed but small-volume neurohemal release zones that only occupy the surface layers of both structures.

For relative quantitation of the C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> peptide, we used <italic>d</italic>0- and <italic>d</italic>4-succinic anhydride. This approach is well established and based on succinylation of free amino groups where modification of basic sites with acidic carboxyl groups occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup> Each modification results in an increase of peptide molecular mass by 100 Da for <italic>d</italic>0-SA and 104 Da for <italic>d</italic>4-SA. MALDI MS profiling of the samples revealed that both peptides, C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> and cerebrin, are present in the extracts (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). Moreover, several related peptides, C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> (1-14) and C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> (1-13), are also observed. MS/MS experiments confirm that these shortened peptide forms are endogenous and not caused by in-source decay of C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> (Supporting Information Figure <xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">1</xref>). These peptides are likely products of enzymatic degradation of C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>) Interestingly, the intensity of the cerebrin peak was relatively low in the ULAB nerve extract compared to the F- and C-cluster extracts (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A). However, a direct interpretation of a lower MALDI peak intensity as a lower amount of cerebrin present in the ULAB may not be correct, as peak heights can be altered via signal suppression by other constituents in the sample.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup> Indeed, analysis of the same samples after stable isotope labeling, mixing, and purification using a solid phase extraction approach demonstrated that the ULAB nerve extract had a higher amount of cerebrin than did the F- and C-cluster samples, whereas the C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> peptide was more prominent in the F- and C-cluster samples (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). These results are in agreement with prior immunohistochemical data where AI immunoreactive fibers are located mostly in the AT nerve, with minor amounts within the ULAB, while cerebrin immunoreactivity is predominantly located in the ULAB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Known SPs can be detected in extracts of F- and C-clusters and ULAB nerves, including cerebrin.

In this work, we used synthetic cerebrin. To minimize the influence of factors such as analyte signal suppression, we employed the method of standard addition (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), even though this approach is not normally applied to so small a volume sample. For our physiological samples, many analytes produced multiple peaks from the molecular ion and ions of their alkali metal adducts because of the high salt concentrations in these biological tissues (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A,C). Relative intensities of the molecular ion, as well as its individual sodium and potassium adduct signals, varied from sample-to-sample and could not be directly fit to calibration curves created via external calibration. Therefore, our approach included internal spiking with synthetic standard and summation of the intensities of the cerebrin-related peaks. This produced consistent data. Results of the absolute quantitation experiments show that F- and C-clusters, on average, contain 230 fmol of cerebrin (three individual samples measured in triplicate) whereas ULAB nerves have &#x0223c;700 fmol (three individual samples measured in triplicate). These observations are in agreement with data obtained on the same samples analyzed with the <italic>d</italic>0-SA and <italic>d</italic>4-SA approach (Figures <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

However, this approach produced more than one labeled product for C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> peptide. Both doubly labeled and smaller, triply labeled peaks were detected (Supporting Information Figure <xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">2</xref>). This situation introduces added complexity to the quantitative analysis process. Moreover, the presence of multiple peaks from a single analyte may result in lower signal intensity of the derivatized analytes. Another concern is that the formation of succinylated amides at all amine residues of a peptide may reduce the formation of positive charges and therefore analyte ionization in the positive mode.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>) To alleviate the issues of multiple labeling of analytes, we used the commercially available iTRAQ kit for quantitation via MALDI MS. The iTRAQ kit includes a set of four isobaric reagents that react with the amine groups of peptides. The iTRAQ labeling procedure requires only one step, and the resulting mass spectra of a derivatized sample tends to be less complicated because differences in stable isotope labeling are revealed only during MS/MS experiments.</p><p>A schematic of the approach used to analyze individual neurons is shown in Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B. There are several important steps to ensure optimal results. The extraction of endogenous peptides should use an appropriate buffer that is compatible both with the MALDI measurement process as well as with stable isotope labeling; a volatile extraction media works well. We used acidified methanol because it is known to efficiently extract peptides localized in biological tissues,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>) its higher viscosity allows manipulations of small solution volumes and deposition in a reasonably small area without spreading, and it evaporates relatively slowly. In contrast, we found that the iTRAQ buffer did not work well as an extraction media for individual neuron samples.</p><p>The addition of the standard iTRAQ buffer to samples containing the extraction buffer resulted in a significantly reduced signal intensity of the labeled peptides. Therefore, improved results were obtained when the samples were dried after extraction and before addition of iTRAQ buffer. Surprisingly, direct MS profiling shows that the stable isotope labeling time in such small samples can be reduced to only several minutes as compared to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommended 1 h (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C, bottom two traces). This reduction in reaction time may be due to (1) small sample sizes allowing faster mixing, (2) the large excess of labeling reagent, (3) or the rapid reduction in volume after deposition onto the open sample plate concentrating analytes and reagents. After the reaction is complete, the evaporation of volatile solvent leads to the formation of a small spot of viscous material, which is then reconstituted with CHCA solution containing an organic solvent. Samples were examined with MS before mixing to verify the absence of detectable amounts of unlabeled analytes, allowing samples to be mixed without removal of any excess stable isotope label. Interestingly, labeling with stable isotopes improves the detectability of several peptides. For example, C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> (1-12) is observed in labeled CF<sub>T</sub> neurons but not in the unlabeled cell (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Despite the relatively small amount of analytes in single cells, MS/MS analysis can be performed on the iTRAQ-labeled peptides. For example, C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub> peptides in two different CF<sub>T</sub> neurons were individually labeled with the 114 or 117 iTRAQ reagent and subjected to MS/MS sequencing after sample mixing (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D). As expected, samples of two similarly sized and located cells have similar concentrations of C<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>-peptide (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D, upper trace), whereas the second mixture containing a larger and smaller cell (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D, lower trace) shows a less intense signal from the smaller cell.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Absolute Quantitation of Signaling Peptides in Small Tissue Samples with MALDI MS</title><p>With the use of MALDI MS, determination of absolute quantities of cerebrin in small samples, such as a single cell or commissure subsection, presents several issues, including the minute analyte amounts and difficulties in small-volume sample handling and manipulation. Dividing samples into aliquots is not feasible for these nanoliter volume samples without employing state-of-the-art microfluidics.</p><p>We validated the well-known approach of standard addition by consecutive spiking of the sample spot with known peptide amounts. Although this appears to be a straightforward procedure, standard addition approaches require a nondestructive readout because the sample is spiked and the signal measured, and then an additional aliquot of standard is added and the sample reanalyzed. Standard addition works here because each MALDI measurement process uses only a small fraction of the sample. In essence, most of the analyte is left behind.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>) Additionally, cerebrin signal intensity was normalized to the signal intensity of the internal standard, angiotensin I, which was added with the MALDI matrix at the first preparation step. This normalization can help to compensate for loss of material if cerebrin and angiotensin I are consumed during the sample measurement process. Interestingly, the average intensity of angiotensin I signal did not change significantly over multiple recrystallizations and spot interrogations (control, 28K counts; 1st recrystallization, 30K counts; 2nd recrystallization, 30K counts; and 4th recrystallization, 29K counts). At the same time, average intensity of the cerebrin signal increased during the additions from 200 to 1700 counts. Therefore, samples previously profiled with MALDI MS can be reconstituted and spiked with an additional amount of calibrant. Implementation of this strategy allows one to build a complete calibration curve for a single cell sample to determine the concentration of peptide; here we have done this for five individual small tissue areas containing &#x0223c;1/10 of a cerebral commissure (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). With the use of a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 as our detection limit and 10 as the limit of quantitation, the corresponding values were calculated as 19 and 64 fmol. Despite the ability of this MALDI MS instrument to probe high attomole levels of peptide standards, the reduced limit of detection observed here may be because of the high alkali metal concentrations in these samples or because of their biochemical complexity.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Multiple additions of the calibrant to the same sample spot on the MALDI sample plate allows absolute quantitation of the amount of analyte present in the spot, in this case, from a small fraction (&#x0223c;1/10) of the cerebral commissure.
