In this study we focused on identifying which bone marrow subpopulations and cytokine treatments play a role in bone marrow supporting islet function in vivo by evaluating whether bone marrow is capable of migrating into islets as well as converting into insulin positive cells. We approached this aim by utilizing several bone marrow lineages and cytokine-treated bone marrow from green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive bone marrow donors. Sorted lineages of Mac-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Mac-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, Sca<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Sca<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, Sca<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/Mac-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Sca<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Mac-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> from GFP positive mice were transplanted to irradiated C57BL6 GFP negative mice. Bone marrow from transgenic human ubiquitin C promoter GFP (uGFP, with strong signal) C57BL6 mice was transplanted into GFP negative C57BL6 recipients. After eight weeks, migration of GFP positive donor' bone marrow to the recipient's pancreatic islets was evaluated as the percentage of positive GFP islets/total islets. The results show that the most effective migration comes from the Sca<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Mac<sup>&#x02212;</sup> lineage and these cells, treated with cytokines for 48 hours, were found to have converted into insulin positive cells in pancreatic islets in vivo. This study suggests that bone marrow lineage positive cells and cytokine treatments are critical factors in determining whether bone marrow is able to migrate and form insulin producing cells in vivo. The mechanisms causing this facilitation as well as bone marrow converting to pancreatic beta cells still need to be investigated.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies have shown that bone marrow transplantation contributes to the recovery of islet &#x003b2; cell function through differentiation into islet &#x003b2; cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004504-Ianus1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

After sacrificing the mice and dissecting the femur, tibia and pelvic bones, bone marrow was obtained by flushing the bones using a syringe and a 22-gauge needle with PBS containing 5&#x00025; heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HI-FCS). After re-suspension in PBS without HI-FCS, cells were passed through a 40 &#x000b5;m cell strainer. Cell numbers were counted in crystal violet and viability was assessed by trypan blue staining. Whole bone marrow cells or selected populations of marrow cells, based on their surface markers, were injected intravenously by tail vein into each recipient. The dose of the cells infused was different in individual experiments and is mentioned in the results section. A photon producing linear accelerator (Elekta) was used for the radiation of recipient animals before each transplant. Radiation was given at a dose rate of 100 cGy per minute. The recipients received 500 cGy of whole body.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Pancreas Collection and Immunohistochemistry Staining</title><p>Specimens were collected after sacrificing the anesthetized mice by cervical dislocation.

Cytokines tested in this study include IL-3, 6, 11 and steel factors in vitro. However, the levels of these factors, or others in vivo, could be different for individual responses to bone marrow transplantation, especially in damaged pancreatic animal models.</p><p>In summary, the current study provides evidence that transgenic mouse GFP gene control promoter, bone marrow subpopulation, and cytokines are critical factors to stimulate successful bone marrow migration and conversion into insulin-positive cells in islets in vivo. The phenomenon of cytokine treated bone marrow Sca&#x0002b; subpopulations having the ability to migrate and potentially differentiate into insulin-positive islet cells still requires additional mechanistic studies to identify the factors behind this effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004504.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>(0.11 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004504.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Dr. LG Luo designed, conducted and performed most of the experiments and wrote the manuscript.
