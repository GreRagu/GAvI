The objective of this study was to evaluate whether accumulation of MDSC occurred in Th2 prone BALB/c and Th1 biased C57BL/6 mice bearing the C26GM colon carcinoma and RMA T lymphoma, respectively, and to investigate whether N(G) nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and sildenafil, both modulators of the arginine metabolism, restored antitumor immunity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report here that MDSC accumulate in the spleen and blood of mice irrespective of the mouse and tumor model used. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with either the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil or the nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME significantly restrained tumor growth and expanded the tumor-specific immune response.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data emphasize the role of MDSC in modulating the endogenous tumor-specific immune response and underline the anti-neoplastic therapeutic potential of arginine metabolism modulators.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>An established tumor adopts several strategies to escape immunosurveillance and this complex phenomenon results in generation of a site of acquired immune privilege [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Over time, local suppression spreads systemically, thereby weakening immunological barriers that might protect against tumor metastasis. Tumor-specific suppression might explain why even immunotherapies that succeed in inducing systemic immune response are rarely of clinical effect on tumors.</p><p>As reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], impairment in tumor antigen expression or its processing and presentation by both tumor cells and antigen presenting cells (APC), release of immunouppressive cytokines and prostaglandins as well as pro-apoptotic mechanisms may directly and/or indirectly impair T cell function while favoring tumor cell growth. Finally, tumor cells may promote development and recruitment of regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC). CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>Treg in particular, represent an essential mechanism of peripheral tolerance to self antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. They selectively express Foxp3, a forkhead/winged helix transcription factor that controls master genes in Treg development/function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Several neoplasms associate with CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+ </sup>Treg accumulation in the blood and/or in tumors, and this may inversely correlate with patients' survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>MDSC are a heterogeneous population of cells of myeloid origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and include immature macrophages, granulocytes, dendritic cells (DC) and other myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Whereas in the spleen of normal mice they account for less than 5% of the nucleated cells, they rapidly accumulate in secondary lymphoid organs, blood and tissues during inflammation and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Several soluble factors contribute to alteration of the normal myelopoiesis and recruitment of MDSC to peripheral organs under pathologic conditions, including IL-3, IL-6, IL-10, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In mice, MDSC are characteristically CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr-1<sup>+</sup>, and may also express CD31 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], CD124, IL-4 receptor &#x003b1;-chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and CD80 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Expression of CD115 on MDSC may correlate with their ability to mediate development of Treg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In humans MDSC have been described to accumulate in the peripheral blood of patients affected by breast, lung, renal and head and neck carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and in melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], but their phenotype is still poorly defined. MDSC impair T lymphocyte functions through different mechanisms, including immunosuppressive cytokines and perturbation of the arginine metabolism by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), arginase (Arg), and reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. More in details, iNOS produces nitric oxide (NO), which interferes with IL-2 receptor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], leading to cell cycle arrest. NO is also a key signaling molecule in inflammation-driven diseases, including cancer, where it participates to cancerogenesis, angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, high Arg activity depletes arginine from the microenvironment, inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and favoring T cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Several Arg and NOS inhibitors have been tested with the purpose to inhibit tumor development and favor antitumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As an example, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine as been shown to restore anti-tumor immunity <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Unfortunately, its use in clinic has been discontinued due to severe toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. N(G) nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) has been reported in several mouse models to inhibit tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Those studies however, did not investigate a direct correlation of its effects on the endogenous tumor-specific immune response. More recently, Serafini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] reported that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil) down regulate Arg and iNOS expression, thereby impairing the immunosuppressive activity of MDSC. In the mouse models tested, restoration of T cell immunity correlate with substantial delay in tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>We evaluated whether accumulation of MDSC occurred in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice bearing the C26GM colon carcinoma and RMA T lymphoma, respectively, and we investigated whether L-NAME and sildenafil restored antitumor immunity and delayed tumor growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>MDSC accumulate in the spleen and blood of tumor-bearing mice</title><p>We initially investigated the effect of tumor growth on myelopoiesis and recruitment of MDSC to peripheral organs in the well-characterized colon adenocarinoma C26GM model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This is a more aggressive variant of the carcinogen-induced undifferentiated colon carcinoma CT26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], genetically modified to secrete GM-CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. C26GM is particularly interesting owing to its aggressiveness (animals are killed by the tumor in less than 2 weeks) and because of the secretion of GM-CSF, one of the factors known to alter myleopoiesis during tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Hence, C26GM cells were injected s.c. in BALB/c mice, and animals were killed 9 days later, when the tumor mass had reached the dimension of approximately 600 mm<sup>3</sup>. Flow cytometry analysis of the spleen and blood of tumor-bearing mice showed a dramatic accumulation of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+ </sup>cells in tumor-bearing mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>, respectively) when compared with na&#x000ef;ve age- and sex-matched littermates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Quantification of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+ </sup>cells demonstrated a statistically significant increase in both the spleen and blood of tumor-bearing mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>). Interestingly, a second population of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>- </sup>cells, barely detectable in the spleen of na&#x000ef;ve BALB/c mice, became well represented in tumor-bearing mice, therefore confirming previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>- </sup>cells were already detectable in the blood of na&#x000ef;ve BALB/c mice, and marginally increased during tumor growth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>). It has been reported that both populations suppress CD8<sup>+ </sup>T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggesting that Gr1<sup>+ </sup>and Gr1<sup>- </sup>fractions of CD11b<sup>+ </sup>cells are differentiation steps of the same MDSC population. Indeed, CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+ </sup>cells may differentiate both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>into Gr1<sup>- </sup>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Tumor-bearing mice have an expanded pool of MDSC in spleen and blood</bold>. Splenocytes and blood cells from na&#x000ef;ve (A-D) and tumor bearing BALB/c (E, F) and C57BL/6 mice (G, H) were stained for CD11b and Gr1 markers and analyzed by flow cytometry as detailed in the Materials and Methods section. Dot plot panels are representative of 8 independent experiments for a total 10 na&#x000ef;ve (A, B) and 38 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice (E, F) and 15 naive (C, D) and 15 RMA-bearing C57BL/6 mice (G, H), respectively. Histograms report the percentage of CD11b<sup>+ </sup>Gr1<sup>- </sup>and CD11b<sup>+ </sup>Gr1<sup>+ </sup>cells as aggregated data (average &#x000b1; SD) for the BALB/c (I, J) and the C57BL/6 models (K, L), respectively.

Indeed, CD11b<sup>+ </sup>cells purified from C26GM tumor-bearing mice were able to substantially abrogate the proliferation of BALB/c splenocytes stimulated with either anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) or &#x003b3;-irradiated C57BL/6 splenocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>MDSC suppress T cells proliferation</bold>.

As an example, BALB/c mice are considered a Th2 prone strain, whereas Th1 responses dominate in C57BL/6 mice. Because Th2-associated cytokines (e.g. IL-6) and other soluble factors are needed to alter normal myelopoiesis and favor recruitment of MDSC to peripheral organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and both Th1 (IFN-&#x003b3;) and Th2 (IL-13) cytokines are required for activation of MDSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], a balance between Th1 and Th2 immune responses may be required for MDSC accumulation and immunosuppressive function during tumor progression. To investigate whether similar populations of MDSC accumulated also in a Th1-prone strain upon tumor challenge, C57BL/6 mice were implanted s.c. with RMA cells, a Rauscher virus-induced T lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Because RMA is less aggressive than C26GM, mice were killed 2 weeks after tumor challenge, time at which the mass had reached a dimension of approximately 400 mm<sup>3</sup>. Tumor-associated accumulation of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+ </sup>cells in the blood of C57BL/6 mice was comparable to the one found in tumor-bearing BALB/c mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>, respectively). A less dramatic but still statistical significant accumulation of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+ </sup>cells was evident also in the spleen of mice bearing RMA lymphomas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref>). Accumulation of CD11b<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>- </sup>cells was less conspicuous in C57BL/6 mice than in tumor-bearing BALB/c mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>, respectively), and was statistically significant only when blood samples from na&#x000ef;ve and tumor-bearing mice were compared (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1L</xref>). Nevertheless, CD11b<sup>+ </sup>cells purified from RMA tumor-bearing mice inhibited proliferation of syngenic splenocytes to an extent comparable to CD11b<sup>+ </sup>cells purified from C26GM tumor-bearing mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><p>Hence, tumor-induced altered regulation of myelopoiesis and accumulation of MDSC is a characteristic common to Th1 and Th2 strains as well as to tumors of different aggressiveness. Quantitative and qualitative differences in MDSC populations found in the two models may depend on several factors, among which the genetic background, tumor aggressiveness, and soluble factors released by tumor and stroma cells, including bone marrow derived cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with Arg and iNOS inhibitors restrain tumor growth</title><p>Accumulation of MDSC in both BALB/c- and RMA-bearing mice suggested that alteration of arginine metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] was a relevant mechanism of immunoescape in these models, and that drugs able to modulate arginine metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] were potentially useful in crippling the immunosuppressive activity of MDSC and delaying tumor growth. To verify this hypothesis, BALB/c mice were challenged s.c. with C26GM cells, and L-NAME or sildenafil were administered starting on the day of tumor challenge. To identify the best delivery strategy, drugs were administered either i.p. or in the drinking water. As control, animals were treated with vehicle (i.e., PBS) only. Both inhibitors significantly delayed tumor growth by approximately 50% when compared with vehicle-treated mice, and both regimens were equally effective (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Modulators of arginine metabolism restrain tumor growth</bold>. BALB/c (A) and C57BL/6 mice (B) were challenged s.c. with C26GM and RMA cells, respectively. The same day mice were randomly assigned to either one of the following treatments: L-NAME or sildenafil (given i.p. or dissolved in drinking water) or vehicle (PBS) i.p. (see Materials and Methods section for experimental details). Tumor volume (expressed as mm<sup>3</sup>) was measured by caliper at day 9 and 15, respectively. Panels report the cumulated data of at least three independent experiments performed with the following number of animals: C26GM model: Vehicle: n = 24, L-NAME i.p.: n = 15, L-NAME o.s.: n = 14, Sildenafil i.p.: n = 10, Sildenafil o.s.: n = 5; RMA model: Vehicle: n = 15, L-NAME o.s.: n = 15, Sildenafil o.s.: n = 10.

Having verified in the C26GM model that the two delivery strategies were equally effective, and to avoid distress and/or pain to the animals, drugs were administered in the drinking water. Also in this model, L-NAME delayed tumor growth by approximately 50% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Conversely, sildenafil did not appear to be effective against RMA lymphoma. The scarce efficacy of sildenafil in restraining RMA growth does not appear to be related to the mouse strain, because Serafini et al. reported an excellent effect of sildenafil in C57BL/6 mice challenged with the fibrosarcoma MCA203 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This discrepancy may more likely be related to the characteristics of the two tumor models (e.g., cytokine production, immunogenicity, aggressiveness, stromal reaction).</p><p>Since chronic treatment with NO inhibitors has been reported to be associated with systemic toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], we monitored animal weight, as a measure of potential drug-related toxicity, and we found no difference between drug- and vehicle-treated mice in both strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The respiratory apparatus (i.e., bronchial tree and lung), esophagus, kidney, suprarenal gland and liver of L-NAME treated animals were also macroscopically and microscopically investigated by an expert pathologist and found with no sign of drug-related toxicity (data not shown). Absence of drug-related toxicity in our animal models might be related to the relatively short period of treatment. Indeed, glomerulosclerosis, one of the effects of L-NAME, is usually found in animals treated for a longer period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Modulators of arginine metabolism do not cause loss of body weight in treated animals</bold>.

Together with the notion that <italic>in vivo </italic>sildenafil treatment reduces the enzymatic activity of iNOS and Arg in MDSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], our findings support the hypothesis that sildenafil has a potent inhibitory impact on the MDSC-mediated immunosuppressive mechanisms. Because sildenafil caused delayed tumor growth and a significant fall of both MDSC populations only in the C26GM model, it might be possible that sildenafil-induced containment of tumor growth is obtained only when myelopoiesis is redirected to more physiologic conditions. These hypotheses need further experimental support.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment with L-NAME does not perturb tumor-draining lymph node cell composition</title><p>Lymph nodes draining a tumor mass (TDLN) or the site of vaccination rapidly enlarge owing to the accumulation of myeloid and lymphoid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We asked whether arginine metabolism inhibitors could alter recruitment of T lymphocytes in TDLN. Because L-NAME demonstrated to be effective in restraining tumor growth in both models, we focused on this inhibitor. Hence, BALB/c mice were challenged with C26GM cells and treated with L-NAME or vehicle as described above. A 3-fold increase in cell number was evident in TDLN when compared with LN from na&#x000ef;ve mice, and was not modified by L-NAME treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

Because MDSC can favor induction of Treg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we also investigated whether Treg recruitment in TDLN of BALB/c mice bearing C26GM tumors was further increased by tumor-associated MDSC and modified by L-NAME treatment.

RMA is an immunogenic tumor (i.e. upon <italic>in vivo </italic>growth it spontaneously induces an endogenous tumor-specific immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]), whose immunogenicity is strongly biased by the expression of dominant viral antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Hence, splenocytes recovered from L-NAME and vehicle-treated C57BL/6 mice bearing RMA tumors, were specifically restimulated <italic>in vitro </italic>and tested for their ability to recognize different targets. Flow cytometry analyses showed that cultures from L-NAME-treated mice contained a frequency of CD8<sup>+ </sup>T cells producing IFN-&#x003b3; upon RMA challenge (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>) higher than the one found in cultures from vehicle-treated mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). IFN-&#x003b3; release was specific because the percentage of cells challenged with the irrelevant target EL4G- was at background level in both cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). RMA-specific response was not due to a <italic>in vitro </italic>priming, because cells from na&#x000ef;ve animals did not produce IFN-&#x003b3; above background level when challenged with the targets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Treatments with L-NAME improves IFN-&#x003b3; release</bold>.

Our results, obtained in different tumor models and murine strains, indicate that tumor growth is associated with perturbation of myelopoiesis and accumulation of MDSC. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with modulators of arginine metabolism may modify such accrual, augment the endogenous tumor-specific immune response and restrain tumor growth.</p><p>Because neither in our nor in other tumor models inhibition of MDSC function by different means caused complete tumor regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], it is likely that acting simultaneously on more than one of the know tumor-associated immunosuppressive mechanisms will result in more successful therapeutic effects.
