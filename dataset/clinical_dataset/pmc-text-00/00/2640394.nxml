A network of defense-regulators transduces information about the attacking microbe into appropriate transcriptional responses. Two functionally distinct classes of pathogen molecules are known to elicit plant immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Receptor-mediated recognition of pathogen/microbe associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs) activates PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI), while recognition of pathogen effectors by plant disease resistance (R) proteins leads to effector-triggered immunity (ETI). ETI is a strong immune response that results in incompatible plant pathogen interactions where the plant is resistant and the pathogen is avirulent. Effectors are pathogen-derived molecules (proteins or small organic molecules) that are secreted into host tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Some effectors have been shown to suppress PTI resulting in a weakened immune response called basal defense which is usually insufficient to halt growth and spread of the respective microbe. The typical outcome in this case is a compatible interaction, where the plant is susceptible and the pathogen is virulent.</p><p>A key player in the regulation of ETI as well as basal defense is the hormone salicylic acid (SA), which accumulates in infected tissues of several plant species and triggers downstream defense responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Several other small molecules and multiple proteins involved in defense regulation have been identified by genetic and biochemical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In particular the immune system of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>(Arabidopsis) has been extensively examined over the past two to three decades. While our knowledge about the Arabidopsis immune system is far from complete, it has become obvious in recent years, that its individual components are functionally interconnected in a complex manner and constitute a regulatory network rather than simple linear pathways. Crosstalk between distinct branches of this network has been found to be involved in fine-tuning defense outputs and maximizing the effectiveness of immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. For example, sophisticated mechanisms mediating crosstalk between SA and jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent signaling processes can result in synergistic or antagonistic effects depending on the levels of each of these hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In addition, there are extensive interactions of defense signaling with regulatory processes that are not primarily involved in plant immune responses. For example, crosstalk between defense mechanisms dependent on the defense hormones SA and JA on the one hand and each of the classical growth-controlling phytohormones, auxin, gibberellin, ABA, cytokinin or brassinosteroids on the other hand have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Details of these interactions are not well understood yet, but it seems that some of them benefit the host by enhancing immune responses, while others are beneficial for the pathogen by suppressing defense reactions. In addition, several labs reported interferences between light and defense signaling. Depending on the type of light signaling pathway involved, these interactions were found to be synergistic or antagonistic. For example, phytochrome-mediated light signaling can positively affect SA-dependent defense responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], while negative interferences were observed between defense and UV-light signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Generally, these interactions seem to control resource allocation in the plant ensuring the maintenance of homeostasis and the adjustment of the host's metabolism to a state optimal to cope with the respective environmental challenges.</p><p>We are using interactions between the pathogenic oomycete <italic>Hyaloperonospora parasitica </italic>(<italic>Hp</italic>) and Arabidopsis to examine regulatory mechanisms operating at the interface between defense signaling and the regulation of the defense transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Several transcriptional regulators have been implicated in these processes, such as NPR1, a nuclear transported transcriptional cofactor that acts downstream from SA and interacts with TGA-bZIP transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Additional transcription factors, including WRKYs and ERFs, participate in the regulation of the plant defense transcriptome and disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The DNA binding site preferences of these transcription factors have been well characterized. Typically TGA-bZIPs bind to TGA boxes (TGACG), WRKYs to W boxes (TTGACC/T) and ERFs to GCC boxes (AGCCGCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These promoter sites have been shown in numerous studies to act as pathogen-responsive <italic>cis</italic>-elements mediating expression of individual defense-associated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>An enormous amount of global gene expression data from large-scale transcript profiling projects has accumulated during the past decade. These data allowed for the identification of gene clusters that are co-expressed under certain biological conditions and, hence, are likely to be subject to co-regulation by common mechanisms. Several studies revealed conserved sequence motifs in promoters of such co-regulated genes which may act as <italic>cis</italic>-elements mediating their coordinated activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition to already known <italic>cis</italic>-elements, some novel promoter motifs were found to be statistically enriched in co-expressed genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. While in some cases, their function has been experimentally proven [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], reports confirming that such conserved promoter motifs are binding sites of nuclear proteins that can affect gene expression are still rare.</p><p>Here we report on the identification and functional characterization of a motif conserved in promoters of the <italic>FORC </italic>cluster, a set of Arabidopsis genes co-expressed in response to recognition of <italic>Hp </italic>as well as other oomycete and fungal pathogens. We found this motif, which we termed <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>, to exhibit DNA sequence specific and differential interactions with nuclear Arabidopsis proteins. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays as well as reporter gene assays showed that <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>integrates stimuli related to defense- and light signaling. <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>acts as a light-responsive enhancer, the activity of which is modulated by pathogen-perception. Under normal light conditions as well as constant darkness, <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>activity is reduced by recognition of <italic>Hp </italic>as well as application of SA, while under constant light conditions its activity is enhanced by defense induction. Consistent with the observed functional connection between light and defense signaling, we observed that plants kept under constant light exposure exhibited reduced susceptibility to a virulent <italic>Hp </italic>isolate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>A cluster of Arabidopsis genes co-expressed during interactions with oomycete and fungal pathogens is enriched for the <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>promoter motif</title><p>Using Affymetrix microarrays we previously identified clusters of genes that are co-expressed during Arabidopsis immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Two of these clusters, cluster I and the <italic>LURP </italic>cluster (designated as cluster II in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]), were defined by distinct patterns of coordinated transcriptional up-regulation during incompatible and compatible interactions with the <italic>Hp </italic>isolates <italic>Hp</italic>Emoy2, <italic>Hp</italic>Hiks1 and <italic>Hp</italic>Emco5. While <italic>LURP </italic>transcripts exhibited a kinetic pattern of late and sustained up-regulation accumulating strongly between 12 and 48 hpi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], cluster I transcript levels tended to increase earlier and predominantly accumulated within the first 12 h after infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Genetic disruption of SA-signaling and R protein-mediated <italic>Hp </italic>recognition strongly attenuated or delayed the response of <italic>LURP </italic>genes, but had only a minor effect on cluster I responses. Inspecting publicly accessible microarray data (Botany Array Resource) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] we found that cluster I genes also exhibit a pronounced pattern of co-activation during interactions of Arabidopsis with the fungal pathogen <italic>Bortytis cinerea </italic>as well as a second oomycete, <italic>Phythophthora infestans </italic>(see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Therefore we renamed cluster I to <italic>FORC </italic>(<italic><underline>F</underline>ungal and <underline>O</underline>omycete Pathogen <underline>R</underline>esponse <underline>C</underline>luster</italic>). Although <italic>LURP </italic>genes are also coordinately activated in response to the oomycete <italic>Phytohthora infestans</italic>, this set does not show an uniform response to fungal pathogens (not shown).</p><p>Tightly co-expressed subsets of both the <italic>FORC </italic>and <italic>LURP </italic>genes were found to be enriched for distinct promoter motifs, such as potential binding sites of WRKY transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This suggested that members of the <italic>FORC </italic>cluster on the one hand and the <italic>LURP </italic>cluster on the other hand are controlled by common regulatory mechanisms. The fact that different motifs are conserved in the promoters of each of these two gene sets suggested that the <italic>FORC </italic>genes are controlled by mechanisms distinct from those controlling the <italic>LURP </italic>genes. Applying AlignACE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] to the 1000 bp-upstream sequences of a strictly co-expressed subset of <italic>FORC </italic>genes (Pearson correlation of 0.95 to the average pattern of the <italic>FORC </italic>set; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]) we found the hexameric motif T/ATGGGC to be significantly enriched compared to its statistically expected frequency (<italic>p </italic>= 3.0 E-4; see under "Methods"). We termed this motif <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>specifically interacts with a nuclear DNA binding activity that is down-regulated by <italic>Hp </italic>and SA</title><p>T/ATGGGC-containing promoter motifs have not been described as pathogen-response elements. Therefore we tested by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), if <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>exhibits <italic>Hp</italic>-dependent differential interactions with nuclear Arabidopsis proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Using the radioactively labeled <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>-1 probe consisting of a single copy of the <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>consensus sequence with the TTGGGC core and 8 bp of arbitrary flanking sequence we detected a constitutive DNA-binding activity producing a single band shift that is out-competed by unlabeled <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>-1 probe (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref>). Surprisingly, this <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>binding activity was down-regulated in response to infections with the avirulent <italic>Hp </italic>isolates <italic>Hp</italic>Hiks1 or <italic>Hp</italic>Emoy2 as well as exogenously applied SA. Furthermore, we found <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>/nuclear protein interactions to be light dependent. Nuclear extracts from plants kept for three days under constant light produced substantially more intense <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>-shifts than those from plants kept for the same time in constant darkness (CL &#x00026; CD in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Besides unlabeled <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>-1 probe, unlabeled competitor probes containing wild-type <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>permutations present in several <italic>FORC </italic>promoters (<italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>2&#x02013;6) clearly reduced the intensity of <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>-1 shifts (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Mutations in the sequences flanking the invariant TGGGC core of <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>-3 did not result in reduced competition. However, the <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>-3 mutA competitor probe, that lacks the TGGGC core, as well as competitor probes with sequences unrelated to <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>(M5-2, M8-1) did not efficiently reduce the intensity of <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>-1 band shifts. These results showed that the observed <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>-binding activity is DNA-sequence specific and that only the TGGGC sequence of <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>and not sequences flanking this invariant core are critical for this interaction.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In vitro</italic>-interactions of <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>with nuclear Arabidopsis proteins</bold>.

Formally the SA-triggered reduction of 3x<italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>-pCAMBIA expression in our agro-transient assays may be due to effects of SA on the viability of Agrobacterium or other effects unrelated to <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>-mediated gene expression.

Four day-old 3x<italic>FORC</italic><sup>A</sup>-pCAMBIA seedlings showed constitutive GUS activity in stems which is most pronounced in vascular tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;a</xref>).

In these plants, GUS staining is in particular strongly detectable in vascular tissues and the epidermal tissues surrounding the bases of trichomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;b</xref>). In mature flowers, GUS staining appears in the vascular tissues of sepals and in the anthers, but not in other flower organs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;c</xref>). After fertilization, GUS staining is detected at the top of the flower peduncle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;d</xref>).

Although multiple types of <italic>cis</italic>-elements and transcription factors controlling defense-related genes have been identified, the important regulatory step of activation of the plant defense transcriptome is still poorly understood. Our current knowledge about defense-associated transcriptional regulation has mainly resulted from the analysis of individual "model genes" such as the Arabidopsis <italic>PR1 </italic>and Parsley <italic>PR10 </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

We found <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>to DNA-sequence specifically interact with nuclear Arabidopsis proteins. These interactions are differential and suppressed by defense-related stimuli. Furthermore, our data showed <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>to function as a constitutive promoter element, whose activity can be modulated by the defense hormone SA or recognition of <italic>Hp</italic>.</p><p>The <italic>FORC </italic>cluster constitutes a set of genes that are coordinately up-regulated in response to infections by oomycete and fungal pathogens.

As in Arabidopsis plants grown under a normal light regime the constitutive <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>activity is suppressed by defense-stimuli, including SA, this element cannot be sufficient to control the defense-associated expression of <italic>FORC </italic>genes. The <italic>FORC</italic>-type expression pattern can only be the result of the combined activity of <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>and additional <italic>cis</italic>-elements that act as positive pathogen response elements.

The bean stem element 1 (SE1), that appears to act as a strong unspecific enhancer, and the oat light-repressor element 1 (RE1), which suppresses light-driven reporter gene expression, contain sequences that perfectly match the <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>consensus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Hence, <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>may act in concert with other regulatory elements to generate fine-tuned gene expression outputs appropriate for a changing array of environmental conditions.</p><p>Crosstalk between light and defense signaling has been described in several earlier reports and high light fluence rates or long durations of light exposure have been positively correlated with plant defense reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. For example, Genoud et al. reported interactions between phytochrome-mediated light responses and SA-triggered responses in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. SA-dependent responses such as expression of the defense marker <italic>PR1 </italic>and resistance to avirulent <italic>Pseudomonas syringae </italic>bacteria were found to be triggered by exposure to high fluence rates of white light and to require a functional phytochrome signaling apparatus. It is unclear, however, if the functional characteristics of <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>that we observed are related to the effects described by Gernoud et al., as different light-related parameters were tested in each study. While Gernound et al. varied the fluence rate of white light, we varied the length of the photoperiod. Multiple lesion mimic mutants also point to interactions between light and defense signaling, as they are known to exhibit spontaneous defense responses, such as elevated <italic>PR </italic>gene expression, upon exposure to high light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. As a possible connection between light and defense signaling in these mutants, light-driven accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), such as superoxide and hydrogenperoxide has been discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].

A number of <italic>FORC </italic>members appear to show enhanced transcript levels after exposure to a prolonged photoperiod or high light intensity (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Although this would be consistent with a role of <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>in light-triggered defense responses, further experimentation will be needed to establish such a functional connection. Moreover, it remains to be examined, if the interference between defense and light signaling we have observed is manifested in signal convergence directly at <italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>and its cognate transcription factors or in regulatory steps operating further upstream. Alternatively, such crosstalk may not be mediated by discrete signaling steps at all and may be merely a consequence of general disturbances of a highly complex plant signaling network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. At this point our knowledge about the architecture and dynamics of regulatory networks in plants is only rudimentary. Emerging new methodologies of computational biology, functional genomics and systems biology will allow us to shift the focus from understanding individual signaling circuits to a more holistic view of regulatory processes. Having promoter elements at hand that integrate signals from multiple input channels will aid in the dissection of such complex regulatory interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>FORC</italic><sup>A </sup>(T/A T G G G C) is a hexameric promoter motif that is conserved in clusters of Arabidopsis genes co-expressed in response to fungal or oomycete pathogens as well as defined light treatments.

Ten microliters of crude extract was added to 290 &#x003bc;l of reaction mix containing 10 mM 4-MUG (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO) in MUG extraction buffer. Reactions were stopped at 15-min intervals by adding 50 &#x003bc;l of MUG reaction mixture to 200 &#x003bc;l 1 M sodium carbonate. Reactions were performed in 96-well plates at 37&#x000b0;C. Fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and emission wavelength 455 nm using Wallac 1420-012 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Science). Protein concentrations in extracts were determined using Bio-Rad protein assays following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The GUS activity was expressed as picomoles of 4-methyl umbelliferone per milligram of protein per minute. Final values were adjusted to eliminate background fluorescence by subtracting the average GUS activity measured from non-&#x003b2;-glucuronidase (uidA, GUS) expressing Arabidopsis seedlings. For <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, GUS activity values are expressed as means of 5&#x02013;10 samples each containing 5&#x02013;6 leaves for three experimental repetitions. For GUS expressing transgenic Arabidopsis lines GUS activity values are means of 5&#x02013;10 samples each containing 15&#x02013;20 seedlings from two independent lines for three independent experimental repetitions.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses of conserved promoter motifs</title><p><italic>P</italic>-values describing the enrichment of defined sequence motifs in promoter sets were calculated using the Poisson distribution as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].
