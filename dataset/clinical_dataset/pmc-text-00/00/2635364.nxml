It has been cultivated in Europe since at least the 16<sup>th </sup>Century. It is sometimes known as the grand father of herbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although a considerable body of information provides evidence supporting the preventive potential of green tea and licorice against diseases, proper understanding of the mechanisms by which tea and licorice reduce the risk of diseases is necessary.</p><p>As accumulative data were done by many previous authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] on the active ingredients of green tea and licorice. The recent work was performed to evaluate histopathological and biochemical effects of green tea and/or licorice aqueous extracts on thyroid functions in male albino rats intoxicated with Dimethylnitrosamine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Male albino rats weighing 150 g &#x000b1; 20 were obtained from the animal house of Postgraduate and Research Institute, Alexandria University. The animals were kept in cages in environment with controlled temperature, humidity and illumination (24&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C, 50&#x02013;60% relative humidity,12 h light/dark cycle). Animals were put on basal diet and water supply ad libitum. 40 Male albino rats were divided into two main groups, 20 normal rats and 20 DMN intoxicated rats, normal rats were sub grouped into 4 equal groups, group A without treatment (controls), group B treated with green tea, group C treated with licorice, group D treated with green tea and licorice, DMN intoxicated rats were sub grouped into 4 equal groups, group E treated with DMN, group F treated with DMN and green tea, group G treated with DMN and licorice, group H treated with DMN, green tea and licorice. The animals were permitted for free access to solubilized extracts of green tea and or licorice for 4 weeks. All rats in groups E, F, G, H were given intra peritoneal DMN (4 mg dissolved in 2.5 ml distilled water/kg body weight) seven times every 2 days in the first two weeks. DMN doses injected to the animals were calculated according to Asakura et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Chinese Green Tea was purchased from local market. Fresh tea was prepared by boiling 2.5 g of tea in 100 ml of boiling distilled water for extraction and the extract was administrated ad-libitum to animals of group B and group F (2.5% w/v) according to Bu &#x02013; Abbas et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] for 4 weeks. Licorice was purchased from local market. Fresh licorice was prepared by boiling 2.5 g in 100 ml of boiling distilled water for extraction and the extract was administrated ad-libitum to animals of group C and group G (2.5% w/v). Mixture of green tea and licorice was prepared by boiling 2.5 g of licorice and 2.5 g of tea in 100 ml of boiling distilled water for extraction and the extract was administrated ad &#x02013; libitum to rats of group D and group H (2.5% w/v) for 4 weeks. After termination of the treatments the tested rats were sacrificed under diethyl ether anesthesia. Blood samples were collected from jugular vein in a little amount of 15% EDTA solution then centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m for 15 minutes where the clear non &#x02013; haemolyzed supernatant plasma was quickly removed and kept at -20&#x000b0;C. Plasma levels of total T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>were determined by radioimmunoassay technique using Coat-A-count total T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>kits purchased from Diagnostic Products Corporation (DPC), Los Angeles. Plasma thyroid stimulating hormone level was determined by chemiluminometric technique using ACS:180 Automated Chemiluminescence's System. Liver tissues were quickly excised, weighed and homogenized in 0.9% saline solution and kept at &#x02013; 20&#x000b0;C for the assay of thyroxine 5<sup>- </sup>&#x02013; monodeiodinase (5<sup>- </sup>DI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] activity. For histopathological examination fixed specimens of thyroid gland were dehydrated in ascending ethanolic series, cleared in two changes of xylol and then impregnated and embedded in parablast at 60&#x000b0;C. Sections of 4&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;m in the thickness, were prepared using a rotary microtone, hydrated using a descending series of alcohol after dewaxication, and stained later with hematoxylin and eosin. The stained sections were examined by a Zeiss(M35W) microscope as described by Drury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The data of the present study are presented as Mean &#x000b1; SD.

Administration of tested extracts decreased body weight gain in normal animals, in agreement with other researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] who reported that green tea suppressed the body weight gain as well as the gain of intraperitoneal adipose tissues. However, DMN enhanced that gain. Administration of licorice to DMN-injected animals augmented DMN effect by enhancing that gain, while the mixture or green tea markedly attenuated that effect. This change may be related to the hypertriglyceridemic effect of green tea, which caused the release of lipids from their depots, liver and adipose tissues, and its lowering effect on weight of various adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Administration of tested extracts and DMN had insignificant increase in liver weight/body weight % ratio. The increase was more pronounced in DMN-injected rats. Administration of green tea showed no effect on marked increase induced by DMN intoxication on that ratio, while licorice or mixture augmented this effect. So, it can be concluded that DMN might cause mild liver hypertrophy. However, while licorice or the mixture enhanced that effect, green tea exerted no change on it. In view of the present study, DMN caused substantial decreases in plasma levels of T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>concentrations consistent with a tremendous increase in plasma level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). DMN also increased the hepatic activity of thyroxine 5'-monodeiodinase (thyroxine 5'-DI). Thus, the stimulatory effect of DMN on 5'-DI was not accompanied with an increase of plasma T<sub>3 </sub>level. Not only the hepatic 5'-DI activity, but also the continuous release from thyroid gland and uptake of the hormone by the tissues can control T<sub>3 </sub>level in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Based on this assumption, it is worth mentioning that the decreased level of plasma T<sub>3 </sub>concentration in DMN-injected animals may be attributed to a decreased secretion and/or an increased uptake or extraction of the hormone by the tissues. Moreover, in parallel with the decrease in T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>levels in DMN intoxicated animals pathological examination of thyroid tissue, showed degeneration, desquamation and atrophy of many acini as indicated in recent study. Green tea decreased T<sub>3 </sub>level, although that decrease was statistically insignificant, while it increased the plasma levels of TSH and T<sub>4</sub>. On the other hand, green tea attenuated the lowering effect of DMN on T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>levels by increasing these levels, the values are still below the normal control ones. In parallel with amelioration of T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>levels induced by green tea administration in respect to DMN lowering effect histopathological examination revealed that green tea improved the thyroid perturbations produced by DMN intoxication. Green tea profound the DMN rising effect on TSH level by inducing a slight increase in its level. This is logically accepted because green tea antagonized DMN effect and increased T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>levels. Green tea induced a decrease in hepatic thyroxine-5'-DI activity but it was statistically insignificant. Also, green tea suppressed the rising effect of DMN on 5'-DI activity by decreasing it, so it is suggested that green tea decreased the rate of conversion of T<sub>4 </sub>into T<sub>3 </sub>and the increase of T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>levels may be attributed to increased secretion and the improvement of thyroid tissue architecture. These observations agree with findings reported by Satoh <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]., Licorice induced a decrease in T<sub>3 </sub>level, while it had no significant change on T<sub>4 </sub>level. On the other hand, licorice induced a substantial increase in TSH level. Licorice profound the elevated effect of DMN on TSH level. It was remarkable that the effect of licorice and DMN on TSH level was additive. The co-administration of DMN and licorice did not affect the lowering effect of DMN on T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>levels. Licorice induced an increase in thyroxine 5'-DI activity, but it attenuated the rising effect of DMN on that activity. Linking rise of 5'-DI activity induced by licorice with its lowering effect on T<sub>3 </sub>level, showing an impression that the stimulated hepatic 5'-DI may be stressed to acclimatize the decrease of T<sub>3 </sub>level, a kind of compensatory mechanism. Consistent with these results, Martinez-deMena <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] stated that T<sub>3 </sub>up regulates 5' DI (type II) in brown adipose tissues. It was obvious that the tremendous increase in TSH level exerted by the mixture was a result of synergistic effect between licorice and green tea. The increase in TSH level was concomitant with the decrease of T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>levels by the mixture. Surprisingly, although the mixture profound the DMN rising effect on TSH level, the increase was not additive. On the other hand, the co-administration of the mixture with DMN did not significantly affect the lowering effect of DMN on T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>levels. The mixture decreased thyroxine 5'-DI activity and inhibited the rising effect of DMN on that activity.</p><p>In conclusion, these results indicated that administration of green tea alone in DMN-injected animals was more pronounced in increase of T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>levels than concomitant administration of green tea and licorice. Also this study revealed that the treatment of the DMN intoxicated animals with green tea and/or licorice induced marked amelioration of pathological lesions induced in thyroid tissue manifested by increase in the number and size of follicles which become more organized and appeared to have higher amount of colloid.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation
