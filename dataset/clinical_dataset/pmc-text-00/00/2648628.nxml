INTRODUCTION</title><p>The vagina is the RodneyDangerfield of the human body; it gets no respect.  Although frequently regarded as a merepassageway for menses, sperm, or neonates, the human vagina is a highlyversatile organ that can profoundly affect the health of women and theirnewborn infants.  The environment in thevagina can impact the probability of conception, the ability to carry a fetusto term, and the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases such as HIVinfection.  Microbes play a critical rolein determining the biochemical and inflammatory profile of the vaginalenvironment.  Although decades of studiesbased on cultivation technologies have illuminated the microbiota of the humanvagina, recent studies employing cultivation-independent methods havesignificantly increased our understanding of bacterial diversity in thisimportant niche.  This review will focuson the bacterial biota in the human vagina, with particular attention paid to studiesusing nucleic acid sequence-based approaches. We will highlight the changes in vaginal bacterial communities that areassociated with the common condition bacterial vaginosis (BV) and will discussthe challenges to using Koch's postulates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]to assess evidence of causation for fastidious bacteria in these microbialcommunities.  There are many importantpathogens in the vaginal niche such as <italic>Neiserriagonorrhea</italic>, <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> species, <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic> species, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>,and <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> which wewill not explore in this review.  Studiesof fungal, viral, archaeal, and protistan diversity in the human vagina areimportant but will not be the focus of this review due to the paucity of publishedmolecular surveys.  Studies of the humanvaginal microbiome in 2009 are in their infancy.  Both metagenomic and whole bacterial genomesequencing projects are underway to help define the collection of microbialgenes present in the vagina and to understand their contribution to normal hostphysiology and disease.</p><p>The picture that emerges from moststudies of the vaginal microbiota described here is static because it is basedon cross-sectional studies that assess the microbial constituents at discreteand infrequent time points.  However,microbial communities in the human vagina likely undergo shifts in therepresentation and abundance of key species over time that are influenced byfactors which may include age of the woman, hormonal fluctuations (e.g., stageof menstrual cycle, contraception), sexual activity (e.g., types of sexualactivities such as oral or anal sex followed by vaginal sex, frequency of sex,number of sex partners, and the genitourinary tract microbiota of thesepartners), underlying health conditions (e.g., diabetes, urinary tractinfection), use of medications (e.g., intravaginal and systemic antibiotics),intravaginal washing practices and hygiene. Future studies will benefit from the use of high throughput technologiesthat will facilitate measuring fluctuations in the human vaginal microbiotaover time in longitudinal analyses with more frequent sampling.  Current data suggest that these studies willreveal a highly dynamic human vaginal ecosystem in many women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. THE VAGINAL MICROBIOTA: &#x0201c;NORMAL&#x0201d; VERSUSBACTERIAL VAGINOSIS</title><p>Gram stains of vaginal fluid smearsfrom women without BV typically show Gram-positive rods, with culturesrevealing a predominance of lactobacilli, particularly <italic>Lactobacillus crispatus</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillusjensenii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Lactobacilli are believed to promote ahealthy ecosystem by producing lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocinsthat have antimicrobial properties thereby excluding pathogens from this niche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. <italic>Lactobacillusiners</italic> is an underappreciated member of the normal vaginal biota, as it doesnot grow on Rugosa agar that is typically used to isolate lactobacilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In contrast, women with the condition bacterialvaginosis (BV) have loss of many <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species (except <italic>L. iners</italic>) andacquisition of a variety of anaerobic and facultative bacteria  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Gram stains of vaginal fluid from women withBV show loss of Gram-positive rods and their replacement with Gram-negative andGram-variable cocci and rods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Cultures of vaginal fluid from subjects withBV typically yield <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> and a mixture of other bacteria that may include <italic>Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Mobiluncus</italic>, and <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species. It isnot known whether the primary event initiating BV is the loss of keylactobacilli or acquisition of the complex bacterial communities found in thissyndrome; these may be simultaneous processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).  It is also possible that some other factor isthe primary etiological agent, and that the changes in vaginal microbiotareflect a downstream event in the pathogenesis of BV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec3"><title>3. BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS</title><p>BV is the most common cause ofvaginal discharge and a frequent reason for women to seek medical attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].  BV is highly prevalent, affecting &#x0223c;10&#x02013;30% of women inthe United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], with higher rates reportedin African American women and women from Sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].  Although BV is an important medical conditionitself, it is associated with several more serious adverse outcomes includingpreterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], pelvic inflammatory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and acquisition of HIVinfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Women with BV may have amalodorous vaginal discharge or local irritation, but about half of the womenwith diagnosable BV have no clear symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].  Some women do not report abnormal vaginaldischarge, but discharge is nonetheless noted on examination by a clinician,highlighting that many women with BV are not aware of their diagnosis orconsider their discharge to be within normal bounds. The high prevalence of BVand the lack of symptoms in a substantial fraction of affected women lead tothe question whether BV should be considered a normal variant of the vaginalmicrobiota or a disease entity. Forwomen affected by severe symptomatic BV as manifested by profuse vaginaldischarge and less frequently by local burning or itching, there is littlequestion that they have a disease. For women with laboratory evidence of BV butno symptoms, the disease designation seems inappropriate, though the conditionmay still impart increased risk of adverse health outcomes such as pretermbirth. Antibiotics such as metronidazole and clindamycin are usually effectivein treating BV in most subjects, leading to resolution of symptoms, thoughrates of relapse are high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Either systemic (usually oral) orintravaginal antibiotics can be used to treat BV.</p><p>Symptomatic BV can be described as asyndrome based on the presence of a collection of clinical features without aspecific etiologic agent defined. Thediagnosis of BV is usually made using a series of clinical criteria collectedby a clinician performing a pelvic examination, or by interpretation of vaginalfluid Gram stains. Amsel clinicalcriteria are usually employed for the diagnosis of BV in the clinical settingbecause the approach is rapid, but it does require access to a microscope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. At least 3 of 4 Amsel criteria must bepresent to establish a diagnosis of BV, including (1) elevated vaginal fluid pH &#x0003e; 4.5; (2) a positive &#x0201c;whiff test&#x0201d; which consists of the detection of a fishyodor upon addition of 10% potassium hydroxide to a slide containing vaginalfluid; (3) the presence of clue cells (&#x0003e;20%) in vaginal fluid which are shed vaginal epithelial cells coated with bacteria creating indistinct borders;  (4) a homogeneous, milky vaginal discharge. Note that it is possible to have adiagnosis of BV based on Amsel clinical criteria without the presence of frankvaginal discharge.  Accordingly,presuming that women without vaginal discharge do not have BV is not valid, andstudies of the &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; vagina should ideally employ an objective method toassess for BV.  Unfortunately there arenumerous studies in the field that have claimed that BV-associated bacteria arepart of the normal microbiota without having assessed for BV status, althoughself-reported vaginal discharge may have been absent. It is possible, indeed probable, that manyBV-associated bacteria can be part of the normal human vaginal microbiota, butthe failure to use consensus guidelines to define BV in the research setting isa recipe for scientific confusion that is completely avoidable with well-designedstudies.</p><p>An alternative method for diagnosisof BV relies on analysis of Gram stains performed on vaginal fluid smears. This approach is most commonly employed inthe research setting where Gram stains are used to classify subjects but isless well suited to the clinical setting because analysis of the vaginal fluidGram stains requires a degree of expertise that is rarely available in realtime when the clinician is faced with the decision whether to treat forBV.  For better or for worse, the vaginalfluid Gram stain is considered the current diagnostic gold standard as itoffers greater reproducibility and objectivity when compared with the Amsel'sclinical criteria. For example, therecan be variation between technicians in the evaluation of wet mounts forvaginal clue  cells. Several scoringsystems are used to classify vaginal smears. The method of Nugent et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] assesses the presence andrelative amounts of three bacterial morphotypes, including Gram-positive rods(lactobacilli), Gram-negative and Gram-variable rods (<italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species), and curved rods (<italic>Mobiluncus</italic> species). A Nugent score of 0&#x02013;3 is considerednormal (no BV) and is marked by the presence of Gram-positive rods, or at leastno <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> or <italic>Mobiluncus</italic> morphotypes. A Nugent score of 7&#x02013;10 confers thediagnosis of BV and is marked by the absence of Gram-positive rods and thepresence of high concentrations of <italic>Gardnerella</italic> or <italic>Mobiluncus</italic> morphotypes.  A Nugent score of 4&#x02013;6 is designatedintermediate flora and has Gram stain features between the two poles.  Alternative scoring systems forinterpretation of vaginal fluid Gram stains exist, such as that of Ison and Hay[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec4"><title>4. THE ROLE OF <italic>GARDNERELLA VAGINALIS</italic> IN BV</title><p>In a sentinel paper published in1955, Herman Gardner and Charles Dukes reported the successful isolation of anovel bacterium from subjects with the syndrome nonspecific vaginitis, nowknown as BV. The bacterium was initiallynamed <italic>Haemophilus vaginalis</italic> but waslater renamed <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>. The authors stated, &#x0201c;We are prepared to present evidence that the vast majorityof so-called &#x0201c;nonspecific&#x0201d; bacterial vaginitides constitute a specificinfectious entity caused by a single etiological agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].&#x0201d; These investigators believed that <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> was the sole cause of BVand set out to fulfill Koch's postulates for disease causation in a series ofclinical experiments. Pure cultures of <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> were inoculated into thevaginas of 13 healthy women, which resulted in the development of BV in 1 ofthe 13, with a corresponding rate of disease production of 7.7%. Based on these data, the investigatorsconcluded that Koch's postulates were fulfilled, though the 92% failure ratecalls this conclusion into question. Theinvestigators went on to perform an additional experiment wherein whole vaginalfluid obtained from subjects with BV was used to inoculate the vaginas of 15women without BV. Eleven of these 15subjects developed BV, yielding a disease induction rate of 73%. The authors felt that these data furthersupported the causal role of <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> in BV because this bacterium was cultured from most of the induced cases. It is our interpretation of these studiesthat whole vaginal fluid is a much more successful inoculum for thetransmission of BV than is a pure culture of <italic>G. vaginalis</italic>, suggesting that there are other factors besides <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> important in diseaseinduction.</p><p>Other evidence suggests that <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> is not the soleetiological agent in BV. Koch'spostulates demand that the etiological microbe should be found in every case ofdisease but should not be detected in subjects without disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] (see section on Koch'spostulates). <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> fails this later test of specificity because it can bedetected in about 30&#x02013;50% of womenwithout BV using cultivation methods  and70% of women without BV using PCR methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. After more than half a century, we are stilldebating the role of <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> inBV. Although <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> likely plays an important role in the pathogenesis ofBV, it is unlikely to be the sole instigator because it is never found as thesole bacterium in vaginal fluid from subjects with BV. Our hypothesis is that BV is a syndromecaused by communities of bacteria that include uncultivated species, precludingthe formal application of Koch's postulates and necessitating new approachesfor establishing causation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec5"><title>5. VAGINAL MICROBIAL DIVERSITY:THE PERSPECTIVE FROM CULTIVATION</title><p>With the advent of moleculartechniques used to measure bacterial diversity, it is easy to discount thecontributions from studies based on cultivation because these studies may failto detect a large number of fastidious microbes in any given niche.  However, cultivation studies provide criticalinsights about the phenotypic characteristics of microbes that are not easilyderived from molecular studies. Furthermore, cultivated microbes allow for the experimental manipulationof these organisms in the laboratory and the testing of hypotheses aboutpathogenesis and virulence factors. Accordingly, cultivation studies remain an important area ofinvestigation in vaginal microbiology, despite the limitations of the approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. One reason for pursuing the combined approachusing cultivation and cultivation-independent methods is that some bacteria aremore likely to be detected by cultivation when present in lowconcentrations. For example, Verhelst etal. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]reported that of the 38 vaginal bacterial species identified from 8 subjectswith and without BV, 5 were detected by cultivation alone. Novel cultivation approaches may be requiredto grow the many fastidious bacterial species found in the human vagina.</p><p>Prior to Burton and Reid's study in2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], almost all of our knowledgeabout the bacteria in the vaginal niche came from cultivation studies whichinvolved isolating the organisms by culture on selective or nonselective mediaand subsequent identification by phenotypic techniques. Just as use of a variety of broad rangebacterial PCR primers helps to maximize species diversity (see section on MolecularApproaches), a number of media and growth conditions may be needed for theoptimal isolation of diverse bacterial species. Relatively nonselective media such as MacConkey agar, mannitol salt agar,and tryptic soy base with 5% sheep blood agar can be useful to estimate numbersof aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in vaginal samples. Selective or semiselective media include Rogosa[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] or de Man, Rogosa and Sharpemedia (MRS) for lactobacilli and the human bilayer Tween (HBT) agar for theisolation of <italic>Gardnerella </italic><italic>vaginalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It should be noted that <italic>Lactobacillus </italic><italic>iners</italic>, present in many subjects with and without BV,does not grow on Rogosa agar but can grow on HBT agar.</p><p>Cultivation-based approaches haveidentified <italic>Gardnerella </italic><italic>vaginalis</italic>,anaerobic bacteria such as <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Porphyromonas</italic>, <italic>Peptostreptococcus</italic>, <italic>Mobiluncus</italic>, and <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> to be largely associated with the disturbed microbiotain subjects with BV. Healthy women arecommonly colonized with hydrogen peroxide producing lactobacilli which arethought to inhibit the growth of the fastidious anaerobes associated withBV.  Specific details of cultivationstudies will not be discussed further but can be obtained from recent reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec6"><title>6. VAGINAL MICROBIAL DIVERSITY:THE MOLECULAR PERSPECTIVE</title><p>Cultivation-independent approacheshave consistently documented the high proportion of fastidious bacteria in avariety of ecological niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and these tools have recentlybeen applied to study the vaginal ecosystem. Results from many different research groups confirm that the humanvagina hosts numerous bacterial species that are either not cultivated or noteasily identified using cultivation methods. These results help to augment, but do not replace, the census datagenerated using cultivation-based approaches. Indeed every method for characterizingthe human indigenous microbiota is subject to some degree of bias.  Therefore, it is our position that the mostcomplete picture of the human microbiota will emerge from the application andsynthesis of different technologies and approaches, including cultivation.  We highlight both the strengths andlimitations of various molecular approaches for describing the vaginalmicrobiota below.</p><p>The most commonly employed targetfor molecular identification of bacteria is the small ribosomal subunit or 16SrRNA gene.  The 16S rRNA gene is usefulbecause it is present in all bacteria and has regions of sequence conservationthat can be targeted with broad range PCR primers and areas of sequenceheterogeneity that can be used to identify bacteria or infer phylogeneticrelationships (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]). Once the 16S rRNA gene has been sequencedfrom a bacterium, the variable regions can be used for species-specific PCReither in a qualitative or quantitative manner. Quantitative PCR is especially useful for rapidly identifying bacteriawhen an internal probe is employed and for measuring how levels of vaginalbacteria change.  Nine highly variableand therefore phylogenetically rich regions of the &#x0223c;1540 base pair 16S rRNAgene have been described and designated V1 to V9  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].  The choice of primers targeting the conservedregions flanking the different variable regions can profoundly affect thediversity of bacterial species identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>It is theoretically possible todetect every known bacterial species if suitable broad range PCR primers orcombinations of different primer pairs are employed. Current studies focus on the extraction oftotal genomic DNA from vaginal fluid on swabs or from cervicovaginal lavagefluid and amplification of 16S rRNA genes with primers that bind to conservedsites present in many species. Thesequences obtained are aligned and compared to large databases of 16S rRNAsequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://greengenes.lbl.gov/">http://greengenes.lbl.gov/</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/">http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>],<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arb-home.de/">http://www.arb-home.de/</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]to infer phylogenetic relationships to known species.  Some studies rely on the construction ofclone libraries and direct sequencing of a particular number of clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].  This approach allows for good phylogeneticresolution if a suitable portion of the 16S rRNA gene is amplified. However, this method tends to be expensive,slow, and tedious. Some investigatorstry to limit the sequencing of large numbers of samples by usingelectrophoretic fingerprinting techniques such as denaturing gradient gelelectrophoresis (DGGE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]or terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In the case of DGGE, as the amplificationproducts pass through the denaturing gel, their melting behavior dependsprimarily on the length of the product and the GC content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Typically one of the primers carries a 5&#x02032;-GCrich clamp, around 40 bp, which is used to detect single-base changes betweenclose products. This clamp tends tolower the PCR amplification efficiency and can increase the presence of PCRartifacts such as heteroduplexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].  T-RFLP involves PCR amplification of thecommunity DNA using primers with fluorescent tags. The resulting PCR products are digested withrestriction enzymes and the fluorescent terminal restriction products aredetected using a DNA sequencer.  Thespecies diversity revealed by DGGE is much less than the diversity detected byT-RFLP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>],and this likely reflects  greatersensitivity of the fluorescence detection platform.  Screening clones in a library by amplifiedribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) in order to limit the number ofclones to be sequenced is also commonly used. ARDRA is based on the restriction digestion of 16S rRNA gene clones oramplified DNA and electrophoretic separation on high percent agarose orpolyacrylamide gels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>An approach complementing broad rangePCR is characterization of the vaginal bacterial community by using nucleicacid probes, oligonucleotides complementary to rRNA gene targets.  Probes are designed using sequences generatedfrom broad range PCR and sequencing experiments which can have a wide range ofphylogenetic specificities ranging from domain to strain levels.  There is also a database maintaining probesdesigned for many bacteria from other niches (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microbial-ecology.net/probebase/">http://www.microbial-ecology.net/probebase/</ext-link>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The probes are labeled with a fluorescent tagand hybridized to the clinical samples. Cells are visualized using epifluorescence microscopy in a processreferred to as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Data can be collected in both quantitativeand qualitative modes.  For example, whenfluorescent probes are combined with flow cytometry, one can rapidly count andcollect cells.  With confocal scanninglaser microscopy, one can visualize the spatial arrangement of cells in tissuesor body fluids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec7"><title>7. DIVERSITY STUDIES BASED ONTHE 16S rRNA GENE: LIMITATIONS</title><p>While molecular methods have manyadvantages over cultivation approaches for characterizing microbial diversity,there are numerous limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Use of some so-called &#x0201c;universal primers&#x0201d;targeting conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene may not detect all bacteriapresent in a sample due to the presence of polymorphic nucleotides at conservedpositions. The primers are moreaccurately designated as broad range. Heterogeneity of the 16S rRNA gene withinthe same species can also hamper fingerprinting analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Lowering the annealing temperature during PCRpermits mismatches when using broad range primers thereby increasing thediversity of the PCR products formed, though this may also allow nonspecificamplification of DNA from human tissues. Degenerate nucleotides can help in overcoming the deficiency of broadrange primers when polymorphic base positions are encountered but can lead tolower efficiency of primer binding due to exact matches of variants beingdiluted in the primer pool. If the primer concentrations are increased toovercome this dilution problem, then there is the potential for increasednonspecific product formation. Inosine-basedprimers are an alternative to degenerate primers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] but these cannot besuccessfully used with <italic>Pfu</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], a high fidelitypolymerase.  One example of a commonlyused broad range PCR primer targeting the 16S rRNA gene is the 27f (8f) primerat the 5&#x02032; end of the 16S rRNA gene. This primerhas multiple mismatches with many Chlamydiae and Bifidobacteria, highlightingthe fact that this primer may be highly inefficient in detecting bacteria inthese phylogenetic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].  More frequently, individual species withinphylogenetic groups may have mismatches that result in reduced amplificationefficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].  Frank etal. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] evaluated the 27f (8f)primers (designated as 27f-CC and 27f-CM) that are commonly used in many broadrange PCR studies and formulated a 27f primer mixture (designated as 27f-YM+3)that included three sequences not usually accounted for in many contemporarystudies. These primers are better matches with bacteria in the <italic>Chlamydiales</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacteriales</italic> orders as well as bacteria in the <italic>Borrelia</italic> genus.  Using a combination of linear amplificationwith the 27f formulation and quantitative PCR, they showed that the formulatedprimer mixture performed better at detecting <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> sequences even at elevated annealingtemperatures (60&#x000b0;C) than the 27f primers typically used in theliterature. Several studies haveattempted to characterize the vaginal bacterial biota using the conventional27f primer and these studies appear to underrepresent bacteria such as <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> which is a common member ofthe vaginal ecosystem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Although use of complex primer mixtures mayincrease the diversity of bacteria detected by broad range PCR, this advantagecomes at a cost. When using the primermixture, there is a slight decrease in amplification efficiency due to areduction in primer concentrations with exact matches.</p><p>We have seen similar problems withthe 27f primer in our broad range bacterial PCR studies of the vaginalniche. We amplified a region of theribosomal RNA operon using 27f  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] modified with one degeneracy(27f-CM) and 189r [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] at an annealing temperatureof 55&#x000b0;C.  Clone library analysison a model subject with BV revealed the absence of <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, unpublished data). In contrast, by utilizing a different forwardprimer (338f) and the same reverse primer, <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> emerged as the dominant clone in the library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, use ofdifferent forward primers on the same vaginal sample results in vastlydiffering rank abundance plots. Forexample, a fastidious bacterium in the <italic>Clostridiales</italic> order designated BV-associated bacterium 1 (BVAB1) was detected using the 338fprimer while all three novel bacteria in the <italic>Clostridiales</italic> order associated with BV (BVAB1, BVAB2, BVAB3) weredetected with the 27f primer. The 5 mostprevalent clones detected with 338f included sequences matching <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> type 1, <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic> type 1, BVAB1, <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> type 2, and <italic>Peptostreptococcus</italic> while the mostabundant clones seen with the 27f primer were <italic>A. vaginae</italic> type 2, BVAB2, <italic>Mobiluncusmulieris</italic>, BVAB1, and an <italic>Eggerthella-</italic>likebacterium.  Using both sets of primers,we detected a total of 22 phylotypes of which 10 were represented as singletonspecies (detected as a single clone).  Whenthis is compared with each primer pair alone, we were able to detect only 15 phylotypeseach, including 5 singletons with the 338f primer and 8 single clones with the27f primer. We also noted that the 27fprimer in combination with 189r tended to be biased to <italic>A. vaginae</italic>, thereby not providing representative reflections ofbacterial abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However,we found that creating two clone libraries with different forward primersresulted in detection of more phylotypes, again highlighting the limitationsimposed by the selection of a single primer pair. Accordingly, we suggest that usingcombinations of broad range primers on the same sample may maximize thediversity of species detected, though this comes at a cost of additional timeand money expended.</p><p>The DNA extraction step is vital togetting a representative pool of DNA which will then be used for PCRamplification. Species bias fordifferent extraction methods is well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].  Presence of inhibitors in the clinicalsamples from blood, mucus, or vaginal products can lead to failed amplificationor a reduction in the amount of product. Amplification controls are useful in tracking DNA quality wherein PCR ofspecific target genes such as beta-globin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or the 18S rRNA gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] can indicate if the DNAextracted from human tissues is amplifiable. Use of internal amplification controls by adding an exogenous templateat known concentrations to the clinical samples can help in detection of subtlePCR inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>],particularly when performing quantitative PCR analysis.</p><p>Another issue with broad range PCRtargeting the 16S rRNA gene is the lack of phylogenetic resolution for somebacteria, even at the species level. Forexample, different species within the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> have very similar 16S rRNA gene sequences. Other gene targets offer improvedphylogenetic resolution for some species, such as the sigma factor <italic>rpoB</italic> present in just one copy per genome[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. A downside of using <italic>rpoB</italic> as a marker is the dearth of sequences available when comparedto the 16S rRNA gene. An alternateoption is to examine the internal transcribed spacer region by ribosomalintergenic spacer analysis to distinguish closely related strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Here again, sequence and size heterogeneitycan be critical limitations, and databases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://egg.umh.es/rissc/">http://egg.umh.es/rissc/</ext-link>)supporting this region are small in comparison to those supporting 16S rRNAgene sequences.</p><p>Correlating the number of 16S rRNAgene copies (and hence clones) to the number of bacteria is frequently notpossible as different bacterial species can have varying numbers of rRNA geneoperons per genome (between 1 and 15) and the exact number is unknown for mostspecies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. Bacteria with higher rRNA operon copy numberswill be excessively represented in a clone library when compared with bacteriawith lower copy numbers, thereby introducing a bias in the community analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Moreover, different bacteria may have varyingsusceptibilities to lysis based on the extraction methods being used thusleading to different quantities of bacteria observed in subsequent analysis.</p><p>Similarly, false positives canimpact community analysis when targeting the 16S rRNA gene using broad rangeprimers. Low levels of bacterial DNA maybe present in laboratory or PCR reagents and in DNA extraction kits. <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase used for PCR amplification can have contaminating 16S rRNA sequences[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. A way to monitor this problem is to includenegative controls in every run of PCR. No template PCR controls allow for detection of contaminants arisingfrom PCR reagents and the water being used in every PCR experiment.  Additionally, it is extremely useful toinclude extraction controls wherein sham samples are processed and extracted inthe same manner as the experimental samples. These extraction controls should be subjected to PCR and analysis ofproducts (such as cloning/sequencing) alongside samples of interest to identifyany contaminants.  Limiting the number ofamplification cycles and using high amounts of template DNA also help inreducing amplification of low level contaminants that may have been introducedduring the different steps of sample preparation.  An important source of PCR contamination isfrom previously amplified products.  Thiscan be managed by separating pre- and post-PCR working spaces, use of aerosolfilter pipette tips, and addition of uracil glycosylase to inactivatepreviously amplified PCR products.</p><p>The PCR amplification step itselfcan introduce biases such as skewed representation of a sample based on theguanosine plus cytosine (G+C) content of the bacterium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>].  Bacteria with higher G+C content may resultin lower throughputs when compared with bacteria with lower G+C.  PCR enhancing additives such as betaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>], dimethyl sulfoxide  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>], or formamide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>] are typically used toequalize the read-through efficiencies of the different templates with varyingG+C contents while the reducing environments created by <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-mercaptoethanolor dithiothreitol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>] seem to provide unspecifiedPCR enhancing effects.  PCR enhancersthat are commercially available (e.g., Q-solution from Qiagen, PCR enhancersolution from Invitrogen) can be expensive and their composition is notknown.  Low cost in-house reagents suchas a combination of betaine, dithiothreitol and dimethyl sulfoxide have beenshown to improve both qualitative and quantitative outputs of PCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>].</p><p>PCR artifacts are a well-knownlimitation when using the broad range PCR approach. Incorporation of incorrectnucleotides using <italic>Taq</italic> polymersase maylead to errors in the sequence. Heteroduplexes may form when primers become limiting and/or there isgreater template diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>].  Use of <italic>Pfu</italic> polymerase which possesses 3&#x02032;to 5&#x02032;exonuclease proofreading capabilities allows for the correction ofmisincorporated nucleotides and hence has fewer errors when compared with <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>].  There are other high fidelity DNA polymerasesthat are currently available such as Vent DNA polymerase isolated from <italic>Thermococcus litoralis</italic> and Phusion DNApolymerase which is a <italic>Pyrococcus</italic>-likeenzyme with a double-stranded DNA-binding domain.  One recommended strategy to limitheteroduplex molecules prior to cloning is to reamplify 10-fold diluted PCRproduct containing mixed templates in a process referred to as &#x0201c;reconditioningPCR&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>].  Formation of chimeras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>]needs careful monitoring and identification. Chimeric sequences are PCR artifacts that arise when two or morephylogenetically distinct sequences become combined into a single sequence whenthe polymerase jumps between templates during extension.  Several online tools are available to detectchimeras such as Bellerophon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>], Mallard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>],or Pintail analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>].</p><p>While the broad range 16S rRNA genePCR approach provides a good census of the bacteria present in the clinicalsample, no functional genomic information is obtained.  Metagenomic approaches have been applied toenvironmental samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>]but are slow to be applied to the vaginal environment due to lack of wholegenome sequence information for creation of a scaffold.  There is presently an NIH-led initiative tosequence whole genomes from cultivable bacteria from the vaginal niche whichwill provide the necessary foundation for metagenomic studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp/">http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec8"><title>8. MOLECULAR STUDIES IN THE VAGINAL NICHE:A CRITICAL EXAMINATION</title><p>With advancing technologiesand decreasing costs of sequencing, there have been many recent additions toour knowledge regarding the human vaginal microbiota.  As conditions in the vagina may be transientand dependent on numerous factors, most molecular studies offer a snapshot ofthe vaginal microbiota under specific conditions.  Moreover, with differing definitions of&#x0201c;normal,&#x0201d; it can be difficult to compare the data across many studies.  We present here a survey of key molecularinvestigations in the vaginal niche, highlighting the important contributionsand the limitations of each approach.</p><p>Burton and Reid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] were the first investigatorsto analyze the microbiota of the vaginal niche using broad range molecularmethods.  They applied a combination ofbroad range bacterial PCR using primers HDA-1-GC (338f with a GC clamp) andHDA-2 (515r) and DGGE to vaginal samples obtained from 20 asymptomaticpostmenopausal women and used Nugent scores to distinguish between healthy anddiseased states.  Interestingly, 70% ofthe women had intermediate flora or BV as indicated by Nugent score, suggestingthat women with abnormal vaginal flora were overrepresented in their studycompared to the general population. Broad range PCR targeting about 200 bp of the V2-V3 variable regions ofthe 16S rRNA gene and DGGE analysis showed that subjects with low Nugent scoreshad only one to two bands, mainly derived from <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species, while subjects with intermediate flora orhigh Nugent scores had zero to four bands representing <italic>Gardnerella</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Peptostreptococcus</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, and <italic>Slackia</italic> species.  The detection of <italic>Lactobacillus iners</italic> in subjects withnormal flora by Gram stain was a novel finding. Genus specific PCR was also used to monitor the bacterial speciesdetected by broad range PCR.  Thestrength of this study is the utilization of both broad range andtaxon-specific PCR approaches, but the DGGE method may have limited thediversity detected.</p><p>An important observation from thisstudy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] is that different subjectswith BV had different DGGE profiles indicating heterogeneity in the compositionof bacterial taxa in subjects with BV. We have observed similar results using different methods. For example,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the differences observed in the composition and number ofbacterial phylotypes in two subjects with BV. Vaginal samples were subjected tobroad range 16S rRNA gene PCR using primers 338f and 1407r followed by cloning,sequencing, alignment, and phylogenetic analysis. The most prevalent phylotypesin Subject A include <italic>Gardnerellavaginalis</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic> sp. type 1,BVAB2, <italic>Prevotella</italic> sp. type 2, and <italic>Leptotrichia amnionii</italic>.  In contrast, the most prevalent bacterialclones in Subject B include BVAB1, <italic>Sneathiasanguinegens</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic> sp. type1, Candidate division TM7, and <italic>Prevotella</italic> sp. type 2, thereby illustrating the differences in bacterial phylotypesbetween two subjects with BV.</p><p>In a subsequent study from theseinvestigators, the same primers HDA-1-GC and HDA-2 with the same PCR conditionswere applied to 6 samples obtained weekly from a 51-year-old woman withrecurrent BV (determined by Nugent score). Overall, 7 bacterial species were detected including <italic>Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia fonticola,Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Kluyvera ascorbata, Escherichia coli</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>].  None of the bacteria typically associated withthe vaginal niche were detected in this study. Similarly, when the primers HDA-1-GC and HDA-2 were applied to vaginalsamples from a cohort of 34 HIV-seronegative Nigerian women with BV, atypicalBV-associated bacteria were detected by broad range PCR and DGGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>].  Surprisingly, of the 34 samples, 10 had only4 bands, 16 had 3 bands, 6 had 2 bands, and 2 had one band.  If each band corresponds to a singlebacterial phylotype, the bacterial diversity associated with BV in this study is substantially lowerthan the diversity detected in other studies and likely reflects the limits ofthe DGGE method employed.  The dominantorganism in 35% of subjects was found to be <italic>Mycoplasmahominis.</italic> An uncultured <italic>Streptococcus</italic> sp. was found in 24% ofthe subjects and a bacterium related to a rainbow trout intestinal bacteriumwas found in 26% of subjects.  Theabsence of several prominent BV-associated bacteria may be related to thechoice of primers, although the authors used the same primers to detect <italic>Gardnerella</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Mobiluncus</italic>, and <italic>Atopobium</italic> sp. in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The different results observed in this studycould also be due to differences in annealing temperatures: 56&#x000b0;C inthe earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and 60&#x000b0;C in thelater study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>], or due to differences insubject populations. The primers used inthese studies have a 40-mer GC clamp that has been included for DGGE analysisresulting in primers that are 60 bases long, which may contribute toinefficient amplification.  Based on thedata presented, the authors suggest that the bacteria associated with BV inNigerian women are different from those bacteria associated with BV in otherpopulations of women studied. Additionalmolecular studies evaluating the bacterial community associated with BV from avariety of women representing different demographic groups are required toassess the degree of heterogeneity in vaginal microbiota among women.</p><p>Zhou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] investigated the bacterialcommunity in 5 &#x0201c;apparently healthy&#x0201d; women. The women were classified as healthy using a combination ofgynecological exams and self-reported symptoms, but data on Amsel's clinicalcriteria or vaginal fluid Gram stains were not obtained or provided.  This is a major limitation of this study asmany women with BV are asymptomatic. A920 bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using primers 8f, also knownas 27f (actual primer sequence not specified), and 926r and the products werecloned and sequenced. Between 176 and250 clones were sequenced from each subject resulting in 2 to 7 bacterialphylotypes per subject. Two subjects hadvaginal bacterial biotas dominated by <italic>Lactobacilluscrispatus,</italic> while <italic>Lactobacillus iners</italic> was detected in 3 subjects.  Theseinvestigators suggest that three novel taxa were associated with the healthyvagina including <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic>, a <italic>Megasphaera</italic> species, and a <italic>Leptotrichia</italic> species. However, these bacteria have been associatedwith BV by other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>]. As standard objective criteria were not usedfor the diagnosis of BV, it is difficult to draw conclusions from this studyabout the constituents of the normal vaginal bacterial biota.</p><p>Hyman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] surveyed the bacteria on thevaginal epithelium by broad range PCR, clone library construction, andsequencing approximately 1400 bp of the 16S rRNA gene in 20 premenopausal womenwho were presumably healthy. Whilephysical exams were conducted in the clinic and the women were reported to beasymptomatic, the authors did not report data on BV status using Amsel'sclinical criteria or vaginal fluid Gram stains; this is a significantlimitation of the study. PCRamplification of the genomic DNA was conducted using the conventional 8f(27f-CM) and 1492r primers. The forwardprimer has one mismatch to <italic>Atopobium</italic> spp. and the reverse primer also has poor homology possibly leading to poorrepresentation of <italic>Atopobium</italic> spp. inthe libraries. One thousand clones wereselected for each subject and sequenced from both ends using conventionalsequencing.  Four of the 20 subjects hadonly <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species with veryhigh sequence diversity indicating that these vaginal bacteria were notclonal. Nine subjects had a combinationof <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. and otherbacteria including <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>Gardnerella</italic>, and <italic>Atopobium</italic>. The remaininggroup of 7 women did not have any lactobacilli but were colonized with mixedbacterial populations that include bacteria that have been associated with BVby other investigators. This studyprovides a rich resource of vaginal bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences in GenBank,but would have been more useful if additional clinical and microbiological datahad been collected to exclude women with BV or define those with thecondition. These investigators detectedsequences from some bacteria such as <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> species in clonelibraries that are known PCR contaminants. It would have been helpful to describe PCR and extraction controls toprove that these bacteria are arising from the vaginal epithelium and are notspuriously detected by broad range PCR.</p><p>Verhelst et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]used a combination of cultivation and molecular techniques to identify vaginalbacteria in 8 subjects of whom 3 had normal flora, 2 had intermediate flora,and 3 had BV as determined by the Gram stain method of Ison and Hay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].  Isolates from culture studies were identifiedusing either 16S rRNA gene sequencing or by evaluating the fingerprintingpatterns of the spacer regions between transfer RNA genes.  Broad range PCR with primers 10f (27f-CC, notincluding the first two bases of the 27f primer) and 534r was used to amplify a &#x0223c;500 bp fragment ofthe 16S rRNA gene resulting in 854 clones from the 8 subjects.  The clones were analyzed using ARDRA andclones with unique ARDRA patterns were sequenced for identification of thebacteria.  A total of 38 species wereidentified using both approaches, of which 18 were detected by cloning only, 5were detected by culture alone.  Healthysubjects had vaginal bacterial biotas dominated by lactobacilli whereassubjects with intermediate flora or BV flora had greater bacterialdiversity. <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic> and several BV-associated bacteria were detectedin a large number of clones generated from subjects with abnormal flora.  The primers selected for broad range PCRproved to be a poor match for detecting <italic>Gardnerellavaginalis,</italic> which was isolated by cultivation.  However, <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> specific PCR showed that this bacterium was associated withBV.  This study underscores theimportance of using a combination of approaches to attain a complete picture ofvaginal bacterial diversity and the need to optimize primers for broad rangePCR. The use of Gram stain analysis to evaluate BV status is commendable.</p><p>Fredricks et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] evaluated the bacterialcommunity in the vaginal niche using broad range PCR with primers 338f and1407r amplifying a&#x0223c;1000 bp fragment from the 16S rRNA gene. This approach was applied to vaginal samples from 9 subjects with BV and8 without BV using Amsel's clinical criteria to define BV in a cross-sectionalanalysis. In addition, serial vaginalsamples were also obtained from a limited number of subjects to study thechange in bacterial composition associated with incident, cured, relapsing, andpersistent BV. One hundred clones fromeach subject were selected and screened using ARDRA with two restrictionenzymes. Inserts with unique patternswere sequenced. Women with BV showed ahigh level of species diversity with a mean of 12.6 bacterial phylotypes versuswomen without BV who had a mean of 3.3 phylotypes per clone library. <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species, particularly <italic>Lactobacilluscrispatus</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus iners</italic> were predominant in women without BV. <italic>L. crispatus</italic> was not detected insubjects with BV, although <italic>L. iners</italic> was widely prevalent. Other bacteriadetected in subjects with BV included <italic>Gardnerellavaginalis</italic>, <italic>Megasphaera</italic>, <italic>Leptotrichia</italic>, <italic>Dialister</italic>, <italic>Atopobium</italic>, and several bacterial vaginosisassociated bacteria (BVABs) from the <italic>Clostridiales</italic> order. Three novel bacteria from the <italic>Clostridiales</italic> order were highly specific indicators of BV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. BVAB1, BVAB2, and BVAB3 belong to the phylumClostridium but are not closely related to any bacteria with known 16S rRNAgene sequences. A subject with incidentBV had a shift from a biota dominated by lactobacilli to one with increaseddiversity including many putative anaerobes. A subject with cured BV had an increase in lactobacilli clones and acontraction in species diversity.  Asubject with relapsed BV had great diversity on day 0 with BV, followed by acontraction to predominantly <italic>L. iners</italic> on day 28 with cure, and then an expansion of phylogenetically rich microbiota onday 100 with relapse. A subject withpersistent BV had a consistently diverse vaginal biota on days 0, 24, and 64,though there were some changes in species representation over time. A limitation of this study is that use ofARDRA to screen clones for sequencing could have underrepresented the bacterialdiversity observed, as this approach tends to lump together differentphylotypes with similar sequences. Moreover, only 100 clones were analyzed per library (or vaginal sample)and this limited the detection of minorityspecies. In order to visualize thebacteria, FISH was performed on vaginal smears targeting each of the novelBVABs.  BVAB1 was shown to be a thincurved rod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); BVAB2 appears as a short, fat rod and BVAB3 is a long,lancet-shaped rod. We have performedtransmission electron microscopy on a vaginal sample containing high levels ofBVAB1 as determined by broad range PCR with clone library analysis,species-specific PCR, and FISH experiments. The electron micrographs show long curved bacteria with a translucentzone in the outer edge of the cells which we presume to be BVAB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure5</xref>).  This is in contrast to the larger,wider, and homogeneously electron dense cells observed in a transmissionelectron micrograph of <italic>Mobiluncuscurtisii</italic> obtained from a pure culture.</p><p>We have further compiled clonelibrary data from subjects with and without BV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).  Using broad range bacterial PCR with 16S rRNAgene primers 338f and 1407r, 1327 clones were sequenced from 13 subjects withoutBV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>).  Of the 1327 clones analyzed, 65.4% of thesequences were <italic>Lactobacillus crispatus</italic> and 28.8% represented <italic>Lactobacillus iners</italic> clones.  The remaining 5.8% of clonesincluded other bacteria such as <italic>Gardnerellavaginalis</italic> and other lactobacilli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>).  These data further validate that subjectswithout BV have vaginal bacterial biotas dominated by lactobacilli.  In contrast, analysis of 23 clone librariesfrom 17 subjects with BV produced 2577 clones and demonstrated a very highdegree of bacterial diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>). Each subject with BV had an average of 14 species and the top 12phylotypes accounted for 89% of clones sequenced.  The remaining 11% of sequences represented 32phylotypes.  Currently, we do notappreciate the role of the &#x0201c;long tail&#x0201d; of less prevalent bacteria though it islikely that they contribute to metabolic and functional diversity in thisniche.  Moreover, the diversity ofbacteria observed in women with BV suggests that this may be a polymicrobialsyndrome.</p><p>The use of broad range bacterialPCR combined with cloning and sequencing provides a reasonable estimate of thediversity of the most abundant bacteria but is an expensive approach with lowthroughput. Thies et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>] used a combination of broadrange PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene in combination with T-RFLPfingerprinting to characterize the vaginal bacterial communities in vaginalswabs from 50 women with BV and 20 healthy women as determined by Nugentscoring.  The authors propose that PCRcombined with T-RFLP is useful to rapidly assess the most abundant bacteria andhence can be used as a tool to screen for BV. Primers for amplification included 27f (27f-CC) and 926r and werelabeled at the 5&#x02032;using 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) and 4,7,2&#x02032;,4&#x02032;,5&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-hexachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein (HEX),respectively.  The restriction fragmentlengths were determined using an automated sequencer and the fragments wereanalyzed using an in-house software program. Identification of the fragments was verified by sequencing of the PCRproducts. A total of 23 phylotypes were detected in the samples from subjectswith BV, with a mean of 6.3 phylotypes per subject (range 2&#x02013;14) including <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic>, <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, <italic>Megasphaera</italic> sp., <italic>Lactobacillus iners</italic>, <italic>Eggerthella</italic> sp. and BVAB1, BVAB2, andBVAB3.  Note that the species richnessdetected in subjects with BV in this study was less than that reported byinvestigators using different molecular approaches.  In concordance with the results obtained inother studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], <italic>Mobiluncus</italic> sp. was detected in only 2 of the 50 subjects withBV.  Only lactobacilli including <italic>Lactobacillus iners</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus crispatus</italic> group, and <italic>Lactobacillus gasseri</italic> group weredetected in samples from subjects without BV. One of the limitations of this fingerprinting approach is the inabilityto distinguish between closely related species. For example, the study authors were unable to differentiate between <italic>Mobiluncus curtisii</italic> and <italic>Mobiluncus mulieris</italic> and also between thedifferent <italic>Prevotella</italic> phylotypes.  This resolution problem could account for thelow numbers of phylotypes per subject that was observed in this study.  A key strength of the study is the largenumber of samples processed from subjects with/without BV defined by Gramstain.</p><p>Ferris et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>] PCR amplified a 300 bp portion of the16S rRNA gene with broad range primers 1055f and 1392r from vaginal samplesobtained from subjects with and without BV as determined from vaginal fluid Gramstains. The DNA was subjected to DGGEand bands confirmed as <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic> were identified in 12 of the 22 subjects with BV and only in 2 of the 24control subjects. <italic>A. vaginae</italic> was also isolated by cultivation from 2 subjects and wasshown to be metronidazole resistant.  Ina separate study, <italic>A. vaginae</italic>-specificPCR primers amplifying a 155 bp amplicon were applied to the same study cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">99</xref>].  The specific primers further enhanced thedetection of <italic>A. vaginae</italic> in subjectswith BV while this bacterium was not detected in BV negative subjects leadingto the suggestion that <italic>A. vaginae</italic> ishighly specific for BV.  PCRamplification using universal bacterial primers and T-RFLP studies also showeda correlation of <italic>A. vaginae</italic> to BV byVerstraelen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">100</xref>].</p><p>Fredricks et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] used a targeted PCR approachto detect 17 key vaginal bacteria in a more sensitive fashion than is possiblewith broad range PCR.  The PCR resultswere compared with the current consensus diagnostic methods for BV in order todetermine if a qualitative PCR approach could be used for the moleculardiagnosis of BV.  Specific primerstargeting various regions of the 16S rRNA gene that are specific to thebacterial species were designed.  Thebacteria were chosen based on clone library data previously generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], their apparent specificityfor BV, or their novelty.  All PCRproducts were sequenced to confirm their similarity to the intendedtarget.  The primers were applied to 264vaginal samples obtained from 81 subjects with BV and 183 subjects withoutBV.  Bacteria from the <italic>Clostridiales</italic> order, <italic>Atopobium</italic>, an <italic>Eggerthella</italic>-like bacterium, <italic>Sneathia/Leptotrichia</italic>, <italic>Megasphaera</italic> types 1 and 2, and abacterium from the TM7 division were highly specific for BV. <italic>Lactobacilluscrispatus</italic> was inversely associated with BV with an odds ratio of 0.02confirming that it is largely associated with healthy vaginal flora. <italic>Gardnerellavaginalis</italic>, typically associated with BV, was found to have poor specificityfor BV. <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> was found in 96% of subjects with BV but was alsodetected in 70% of the subjects without BV. The combination of detecting one of the <italic>Clostridiales</italic> bacteria (BVAB2) or <italic>Megasphaera</italic> type 1 produced the best sensitivity and specificityfor PCR diagnosis of BV, regardless of the gold standard diagnostic criteriaemployed (sensitivity 99% and specificity 89%). This suggests that PCR amplification of key vaginal bacteria can indeedbe used for the molecular diagnosis of BV. However, the approach used here requires electrophoresis to detect theamplification products which may not be optimal in clinical settings.  A better approach would be to usequantitative PCR that offers real-time results and the ability to quantifybacteria.  Levels of the bacteria may bea better indicator of disease than the presence/absence of particular species.</p><p>Some studies have investigated theutility of quantitative PCR (qPCR) as a diagnostic tool for BV.  Sha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">101</xref>] were the first group toexamine the use of qPCR for the diagnosis of BV, targeting <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, <italic>Mycoplasmahominis</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species using 203 samplesfrom women with BV (Nugent score 7&#x02013;10) and 203samples from women without BV (Nugent score 0&#x02013;3).  Only 75 of the 203 women with BV by Nugentscore were positive by Amsel criteria. Increasing levels of <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> and <italic>M. hominis</italic> and decreasing levelsof lactobacilli were shown to be significantly associated with BV with asensitivity and specificity of 83% and 78% when compared with Nugentscore. The study did not evaluate womenwith intermediate flora.</p><p>In a subsequent study, Menard etal. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">102</xref>] also investigated theassociation of <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> as well as <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic> loads byquantitative PCR and assessed their utility as a diagnostic tool in 231 samplesfrom 204 women.  Nugent criteria wereused to assess BV status, classifying 167 samples as normal flora, 20 samplesas BV, and 44 samples as intermediate flora. They showed that the combination of the presence of <italic>A. vaginae</italic> at the DNA level   &#x02265;10<sup>8</sup> copies/mL and <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> at &#x02265;10<sup>9</sup> copies/mL had a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 99%,respectively. However, subjects with intermediate flora were excluded from thisanalysis.  Unfortunately, the promising resultsfrom this study do not reflect how these assays would perform in a clinicalsetting where all women are being screened for BV, including those withintermediate flora on Nugent score. It would have been helpful to collect dataon Amsel clinical criteria in these women to assess BV status using analternative standard to determine the reliability of the molecular approach inall women.  Another limitation is therelatively small number of women with BV (20) in the study.  A smaller validation cohort of 56 women wasassessed, of which 7 were considered to have BV by Gram stain and 10intermediate flora.  Eleven of these 56women had molecular criteria for BV.  Itis not clear if the authors are proposing to treat all women with intermediateflora for BV when they have molecular evidence of BV-associated bacteria.</p><p>Zozaya-Hinchliffe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">103</xref>] assessed the prevalence andabundance of uncultivated <italic>Megasphaera</italic>-likebacteria in the vaginal niche using quantitative PCR targeting two <italic>Megasphaera</italic> phylotypes in a cohort of 41women.  The subjects were diagnosed byvaginal Gram stains and Amsel's criteria. Primers specifically targeting each type were tested for cross-reactivityusing vaginal clones. <italic>Megasphaera</italic> type 1 was detected in 76%of the subjects while <italic>Megasphaera</italic> type 2 was found in 52% of the subjects. Moreover, <italic>Megasphaera</italic> type 1concentrations were higher in subjects with BV (up to 5 orders of magnitude)than subjects without BV, and this bacterium was significantly associated withBV (<italic>P</italic> = .0072), as was <italic>Megasphaera</italic> type 2 (<italic>P</italic> = .0366).  Phylogeneticanalysis of sequence data indicated that the <italic>Megasphaera</italic> phylotypes form two well-supported clades that do notmatch sequences originating from the rumen, gut, or oral environments,suggesting that these two phylotypes may be specific to the vaginal niche.</p><p>Current treatment strategies for BVinclude the administration of antibiotics either orally or topically.  The use of oral metronidazole for 7 days orvaginal metronidazole for 5 days results in an improvement of symptoms in 83%&#x02013;87% of women within 2 to 3 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">105</xref>].  Similar response rates are observed with theuse of vaginal clindamycin.  Vaginalrecolonization rates with lactobacilli are similar with both antibiotics, asdefined by detection of lactobacilli on Gram stain 21&#x02013;30 days afterstart of antibiotic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">106</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">107</xref>].  Although there is response to antibiotics inmany women, persistence or recurrence of the condition occurs in 11%&#x02013;29% of women at 1 month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">104</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">108</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">109</xref>].  Moreover, long-term recurrence rates havebeen shown to be greater than 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">110</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>].  Marrazzo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] investigated several riskfactors for BV persistence one month after treatment, including the detectionof key vaginal bacteria by species-specific PCR.  Persistent BV  was present in 25.8% of women at the 1-monthfollow-up visit as determined by Amsel's clinical criteria, also confirmed byvaginal fluid Gram stains. Taxon-specific PCRs targeting bacterial 16S rRNA genes were used todetect BVAB1, BVAB2, BVAB3, <italic>Peptoniphiluslacrimalis</italic>, <italic>Megasphaera</italic> type 2,and <italic>Mobiluncus curtisii</italic> at baselineand 1-month follow-up visits.  Data wereanalyzed by presence or absence of the bacteria. <italic>Atopobium</italic>, <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, <italic>Megasphaera</italic> type 1, and <italic>Lactobacillus iners</italic> were found in &#x02265;96%of subjects at baseline and therefore, these bacteria were not included in theassessment of risk factors for persistence. Women with BVAB1, BVAB2, or BVAB3 at baseline were shown to have a 2&#x02013;8-fold increasedrisk of persistent BV. Likewise,presence of <italic>P. lacrimalis</italic> or <italic>Megasphaera</italic> type 2 at baseline imparteda  &#x0003e;3-fold increased risk of persistent BV. Other risk factors such as sexual behaviors commonly linked withpersistence were also examined but were not associated with persistent BV inthis study.  A limitation of thisapproach is that the persistence data was based on qualitative detection ofbacteria rather than quantitative analyses. Quantitative PCR would help determine if the bacterial levels remainunchanged during antibiotic treatment (antibiotic resistance), or if the levelsdecline but bacteria are not eradicated, allowing for a future relapse.  Another limitation of this study is thefocus on women who have sex with women. It is not clear if the same patterns will hold in heterosexual womenwith BV.</p><p>Oakley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">112</xref>] performed a systematicanalysis of bacterial diversity in women with and without defined BV,incorporating data from Genbank that included publicly available 16S rRNA genesequence data obtained from the vaginal niche. A total of 969 sequences were aligned and assigned taxonomicclassifications using the Greengenes 16S rRNA gene database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">113</xref>].  The sequences were further analyzed based onself-similarities rather than in comparison with an external database andclassified into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the DOTUR softwarepackage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">114</xref>] at a 97% sequence similaritycutoff, which is commonly used for species definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">115</xref>].  Indeed, subjects with BV had a much greaterdiversity of bacteria; at the 97% cutoff, women with BV had three times thenumber of OTUs (15 OTUs) when compared with subjects without BV (5 OTUs). An interesting observation madein this study was that even though there was quite a bit of variability in thebacterial species between different subjects with BV, at the phylum level, thepresence of bacteria from Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria was stronglyassociated with BV. The authors point out that studies assessing bacterialdiversity in the vaginal niche might be underestimating the true diversity bylabeling bacteria with the NCBI-based designations that lump bacteria withknown species.  For example, sequencesclassified as <italic>Prevotella</italic> using theNCBI classification scheme of the Greengenes classification tool actuallyrepresented 21 OTUs based on the 97% cutoff using the DOTUR analytical tool,revealing an unexpectedly high number of vaginal phylotypes or species in thisgenus.  These different vaginalphylotypes may have different functional, metabolic, and inflammatoryproperties.  A limitation of the study byOakley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">112</xref>] is that the Greengenes NCBIclassification tool used may assign different identities to the same sequencesimply based on sequence length.  Forinstance, two sequences of 100% identity but different lengths can bedesignated as either <italic>Gardnerella</italic> or <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>. Similarly, two identical <italic>Atopobium</italic> sequences different only in sequence length can either be <italic>Atopobium</italic> or <italic>Olsenella</italic>. Sequences classified as <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> in the NCBI classification scheme of the Greengenesdatabase were classified as <italic>Gardnerella</italic> in the RDP database.  This discrepancyhighlights the larger problem of defining bacterial nomenclature, which is acontinuing challenge for microbial ecologists. One way of addressing this problem is to create a database of referencesequences to which all new sequences from the same niche are submitted.  This would also allow rigorous tracking ofnovel sequences.  As we develop greaterunderstanding of the ecology of the vaginal ecosystem, we hope that allresearchers will be able to use the same taxonomic nomenclature to facilitatecomparisons across studies. For example, there is a human oral microbiomedatabase that provides cross-referenced taxonomic and genomic information forapproximately 600 species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.homd.org/">http://www.homd.org/</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">116</xref>].</p><p>Zhou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]studied vaginal bacterial communities in Caucasian and African American womenin the United States .  They applied T-RFLP analysis to 144 womenranging equally in ages and racial groups from various locations in the US.  The subjects were classified as healthy basedon examinations by medical personnel, but again BV status was not reportedusing either Amsel clinical criteria or Gram stain assessment of vaginal fluid.  Restriction fragment pattern analysisresulted in the identification of 12 bacterial communities present in at least2 women, and 8 communities present in single subjects.  Using broad range 16S rRNA gene PCR primers8f (27f-CC) and RD1r [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">117</xref>], 57 clone libraries wereanalyzed and &#x0223c;6000 clones were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained led to theclassification of the bacterial biota into 8 &#x0201c;supergroups.&#x0201d;  Five of the 8 supergroups were dominated bylactobacilli, representing 80% of the women sampled.  Supergroup III, accounting for 16.5% of womensampled, had low levels of lactobacilli and a diversity of bacteria thatmultiple other groups have associated with BV, such as <italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic>, bacteria from the <italic>Clostridiales</italic> order, <italic>Megasphaera</italic>, <italic>Dialister</italic>, <italic>Anaerococcus</italic>, <italic>Finegoldia</italic>, <italic>Peptostreptcoccus</italic>, and <italic>Eubacterium</italic>.  Since objective criteria were not used toassess for BV status (or were not reported), it is unclear if these subjectshad BV or whether BV-associated bacteria colonized women without BV in thisstudy.  The study authors analyzedwhether the bacterial community &#x0201c;supergroups&#x0201d; were associated specifically withrace.  Statistical analysis showed thatsupergroups III and VIII (containing a single clade of <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>) were found more often in African American women. Vaginal bacterial communities not dominated by lactobacilli were found in 33%of African American women and 7% of Caucasian women.  It is known that African American women havea higher rate of BV than Caucasian women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].  The racial differences in vaginal microbiotaof &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; women noted in this study may simply reflect the failure to assessfor BV. A substantial fraction of women with BV are asymptomatic, therefore assessingfor BV status based on self-report of symptoms, as done in this study, isunreliable. Nevertheless, the fact that African American women have a higherprevalence of BV and therefore tend to have more diverse vaginal bacterialcommunities begs for an explanation. Strengths of the paper include the largenumber of samples processed, the use of T-RFLP to screen for community types,and rigorous statistical analyses applied. Limitations are the lack of objective diagnostic criteria for BV and useof a 27f primer for broad range analysis with poor homology to some vaginalbacteria that may account for the almost negligible abundance of <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> detected.  The meaning of bacterial community&#x0201c;supergroups&#x0201d; is diminished when key members of the vaginal bacterial communityare underrepresented, though this is a problem that is shared by all studiesusing broad range PCR to some degree.</p><p>One study assessed the vaginalmicrobiota from 16 women without BV (assessed by Nugent score &#x0003c;4), using aPCR-based approach targeting the chaperonin-60 gene (<italic>cpn</italic>60) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">118</xref>].  Chaperonin-60 is present in all bacteria andis required for the folding and assembly of proteins and protein complexes.  Most subjects were colonized largely withlactobacilli including <italic>Lactobacilluscrispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus iners</italic>.  Othersequences identified included those with similarity to <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, <italic>Porphyromonas</italic> spp., <italic>Megasphaera</italic> spp, and <italic>Chlamydophila psittaci</italic>.  This is the only study that has examined thediversity of bacteria in the vaginal niche using a different target gene.  This study provides a nice corroboration ofresults from studies using the 16S rRNA gene as a target, wherein lactobacillihave been shown to dominate the bacterial biota in subjects without BV.  The detection of <italic>C. psittaci</italic> as part of the normal vaginal flora is interesting andrather surprising since this Chlamydia species is considered a respiratory andzoonotic pathogen and has not been previously detected in the human vagina,though it has been detected in the ovine vagina.  Using a different target gene offers adifferent perspective on the constituents of a microbial community.  However, the limited database of <italic>cpn60</italic> gene sequences may hinder accuratebacterial identification and the generation of phylogenetic inferences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec9"><title>9. PYROSEQUENCING: A HIGH THROUGHPUTSEQUENCING APPROACH</title><p>While conventional sequencingtechniques have provided us with a framework, the true extent of bacterialdiversity in the vaginal niche is poorly understood.  Analysis of the sequence data from 100 even1000 clones results in a library with a long tail of many phylotypes detectedas singlet clones when the data is represented in rank abundance plots.  Based on culture techniques, it is estimatedthat the density of vaginal bacteria per gram of vaginal fluid ranges up to 10<sup>8</sup> colony forming units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">119</xref>].  If a subject has 10<sup>8</sup> bacteria/gmof vaginal fluid and 100 clones are characterized, bacteria present at  10<sup>6</sup> CFU or below are less likely to be included in the analysis.  Moreover, classical clone library analysistends to provide less emphasis to the long tail of minority species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].  In fact, the census of bacteria present atlow concentrations may provide important details about genetic and functionaldiversity in this niche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">120</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B121">121</xref>].  This is especially relevant in a syndromesuch as BV where we still do not understand the pathogenesis of infection.</p><p>An alternate approach for obtaininglarge numbers of sequences is by using pyrosequencing technology.  Pyrosequencing is a &#x0201c;sequencing by synthesis&#x0201d;method which involves taking a single strand of DNA to be sequenced andsequencing the complementary strand enzymatically while monitoring the photonsgenerated with the addition of each base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">122</xref>].  The technology was applied on a small scalelevel to identify isolates by analyzing the signature sequences of the V1 andV3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene in 96 well plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">123</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">124</xref>].  A disadvantage of the early approach was thevery short read lengths obtained (25 to 100 nucleotides long) limiting accuratephylogenetic classification.</p><p>Currently, pyrosequencingtechnology has been further developed and it is now possible to achieve longerreads of 250 to 300 bps in a throughput of 400 000 reads per 7.5 hour run whichcan generate over 100 million bases (Genome Sequencer FLX System&#x02014;454 Life Sciences).  The extracted DNA from the vaginal sample canbe amplified using fusion broad range primers (modified with adaptor sequences)targeting the variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene.  The PCR products with the adaptor sequenceare attached to microscopic capture beads. Emulsion-based clonal amplification (emPCR) can create several copies ofthe target 16S rRNA gene sequence per bead without the need for cloning thesequences into bacteria.  The beads arethen transferred to a picotitre plate for sequencing.  Pyrosequencing technology has been used formicrobial community analysis in a variety of environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">125</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130">130</xref>].</p><p>Sundquist et al. examined thebacterial biota in vaginal samples from 6 pregnant women in all threetrimesters of pregnancy using broad range bacterial PCR with deeppyrosequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B129">129</xref>].  Most of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene wasamplified by PCR and portions of the gene were then subjected topyrosequencing.  A total of 100 000 to200 000 sequence reads of about 100 bp average length were obtained for each ofthe 6 samples.  Each read was processedusing the BLAT tool, a BLAST-like alignment tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131">131</xref>], and a database of bacterialsequences obtained from RDP and archaeal sequences from <italic>prokMSA.</italic> Two majorroadblocks were faced by the study investigators.  First, the short read lengths made itchallenging to assign phylogeny to the sequence reads.  For example, while 90% of the reads wereidentified to the domain level, less than 10% were identified to the specieslevel.  Only about 50% of sequences wereunambiguously assigned to the class level, and this was likely due to theamplification of both conserved and variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene,limiting phylogenetic resolution.  Theauthors also performed simulation calculations and showed that increasingsequence read lengths up to 800 bp had significant impacts on phylogeneticassignments.  Current 454 technology allowsa read length of 250 bp with 400 bp reads on the horizon or in place at thetime of this review.  The secondchallenge encountered by the investigators was the lack of sequences in publicdatabases resulting in many bacteria being classified as &#x0201c;unknown.&#x0201d;  This problem will improve with time as moresequences are added to the databases.  Inaccordance with data obtained from conventional cloning and sequencingexperiments, the Sundquist study showed that subjects were largely colonizedwith lactobacilli, with a variety of other bacteria at lower concentrationsincluding some such as <italic>Comamonas</italic>.  In our hands, <italic>Comamonas</italic> spp. are common PCR contaminants that are typicallypresent in water samples. As the study did not report results from negativecontrols such as sham DNA extractions with PCR and subsequent pyrosequencing,it is difficult to evaluate if <italic>Comamonas</italic> is indeed a part of the vaginal bacterialbiota. It is imperative to conductappropriate negative controls especially for pyrosequencing studies as thetechnique involves deep sequencing and can therefore easily pick upcontaminating sequences even at low concentrations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec10"><title>10. BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS: A BIOFILM SYNDROME?</title><p>Biofilms arestrongly associated with human infections and up to 65% of infections treatedby physicians in the developed world have been attributed to biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B132">132</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B133">133</xref>].

Adherent biofilms were defined as lawns ofbacteria that were tightly attached to the vaginal epithelial surface andcontained specific bacterial groups. Biopsies collected from women with and without BV were sectioned andfixed for FISH and hybridized with a variety of bacterial rRNA-targetedprobes.  Typically, subjects with BV hadan adherent biofilm that was primarily composed with 3 bacterial groups: <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> was present in 60to 90% of the biofilm mass, <italic>Atopobium</italic> accounted for 1 to 40% of the biofilm mass, and lactobacilli were presentbetween 1 to 5% in only 20% of the biopsy samples.

Our data also suggests the presence of a <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> biofilm in women with BV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) while subjectswithout BV did not have a biofilm but had scattered <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species.</p><p>More recently, Swidsinski et al. evaluated the effect of oral metronidazole on the BV biofilm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">135</xref>].

Although, all subjects studied were considered cured of BV at the end ofthe antibiotic therapy, vaginal biopsies revealed a persistent biofilm.  During antibiotic therapy, the biofilm couldbe visualized with DAPI (a DNA stain) but had poor uptake of FISH probestargeting rRNA suggesting that the bacteria were not activelymetabolizing.  However, at the end of 5weeks, an actively metabolizing adherent bacterial biofilm was detected whichprimarily consisted of <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> and <italic>Atopobium</italic> sp.

Important limitations of this study, alsonoted by the authors, include the small sample size and lack of baseline data.  Furthermore, the dataset was treated asa longitudinal cohort but each time point represented a group of 3 differentsubjects.

The birth of modernmicrobiology in the latter half of the 19th century necessitated a system togauge evidence of causation concordant with the discovery of numerous human andanimal associated microbes through laboratory propagation. These guidelines,later called Koch's postulates, are elaborated in Koch's paper &#x0201c;On the Etiologyof Tuberculosis&#x0201d; where he beautifully lays out the foundation for histhinking.  Robert Koch was a prescientgiant of microbiology whose thinking has served us well through more than acentury of use.  However, the power ofKoch's postulates arises not from their rigid application, but from the spiritof critical judgment that they foster.</p><p>The esteemed researcher EdwardRosenow provided evidence that a streptococcus was the cause of poliomyelitisby fulfilling Koch's postulates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B142">142</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B144">144</xref>],only to have this theory overturned with the discovery of poliovirus decadeslater. The lack of specificitydemonstrated by Rosenow's false attribution of causation to streptococci in thecase of polio highlights only one of many possible limitations of Koch'spostulates that have emerged after more than a century of reflection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). These limitations do not seriously undermine the generally highly specificability of Koch's postulates to identify true pathogens. If a pathogen fulfills Koch's postulatesthen it is most likely the cause of the disease, though these results need tobe reproducible and consistent. In thecase of <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> and BV,the ability of a pure culture of <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> to produce BV in 1 of 13 inoculated subjects is not a verycompelling argument for causation without a better explanation for the 92%failure rate (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4">Section 4</xref>). Taken to its logical extreme, the successful induction of AIDS in 1 of1000 subjects inoculated with <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> would also not &#x0201c;fulfill&#x0201d; Koch's third postulate for the role of <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> in AIDS in any meaningful orrigorous fashion. Nevertheless, theexperimental reproduction of disease using pure cultures of microbes is themost powerful single approach for establishing a causal connection between amicrobe and a disease. On the otherhand, the failure to fulfill Koch's third postulate does not mean that amicrobe is not the cause of a disease. Koch's postulates have excellent specificity for causation, but poorsensitivity. For example, many microbeshave not been successfully propagated in pure culture in the laboratory; thesemicrobes cannot fulfill Koch's postulates as originally defined. The historical evolution in thinking aboutcausation and Koch's postulates is described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec12"><title>12. A MOLECULAR VERSION OF KOCH'S POSTULATES</title><p>A major limitation of Koch'spostulates is the failure to account for the possibility that uncultivatedmicrobes play a role in disease.  The useof molecular methods to characterize microbial diversity in many niches hasrevealed that cultivated species constitute a minority of microbes in manyecosystems, including in the human body. Many potential pathogens can bereadily detected using molecular methods such as PCR.  Koch's postulates can be directly translatedinto molecular versions, as follows. <list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The etiologic microbe or itsnucleic acid sequences should be found in every case of disease. This impliesthat the microbe (or its products) is a sensitive indicator of disease.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The etiologic microbe or itsnucleic acid sequences should not be found in subjects without disease. Thisimplies that the microbe is a specific indicator of disease.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Experimental manipulation ofinfection through factors such as antimicrobial agents or induction of immuneresponses should demonstrate that changes in levels of an etiologic microbecorrelate with disease state in the host.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec13"><title>13. DISEASE BY MICROBIAL COMMUNITY</title><p>There are some disease syndromes that may becaused by consortia of microbes rather than single pathogens.  Examples of these polymicrobial syndromes aregingivitis, periodontitis, and BV.  Provingthat a single cultivated or uncultivated microbe is the cause of a disease canbe challenging.  Proving that a microbialconsortium is the cause of a disease is even more daunting.</p><p>Microbes probably exist incommunities in order to take advantage of syntrophic relationships wherein themetabolic end product of one species is the energy source for a secondspecies.  If critical members of thecommunity are lost, then the metabolic networks collapse and all members of thecommunity may suffer.  However,functional redundancy among microbes may mean that bacterium A is not necessaryfor community health as long as bacterium B is present with its overlappingmetabolic capacity.  What does this meanif bacteria A and Bare part of a pathogenic community?  Itmeans that neither bacterium will be deemed necessary for disease, becausesubjects may have disease when lacking bacterium A or B, though subjects willnot have disease if lacking both bacteria.  Bacteria A and B are considered sufficient when part of the larger community, but not individually necessaryfor establishing the community and producing condition. To address this issue, wewill need to assess not only the species composition of pathogenic microbialcommunities, but also the metabolic capabilities and interdependencies of thesecommunities. Studies of the human microbiome will be vital in filling this knowledgegap.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec14"><title>14. CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In the last two decades, there hasbeen a dramatic increase in our understanding of the bacterial biota in a varietyof ecological environments using cultivation-independent molecularmethods.  These methods have recentlybeen applied to the human vaginal microbial ecosystem, adding substantial dataon bacterial diversity in this niche. Subjects without BV have bacterial biotas that are less complex and aredominated by <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species.  Subjects with BV have loss of <italic>Lactobacillus crispatus</italic> and acquisitionof more complex vaginal bacterial communities that include manyheretofore-uncultivated species.  Data emergingfrom molecular investigations suggest that it is possible to develop aPCR-based strategy for the diagnosis for BV. BV may be an example of a condition produced by a pathogenic microbialcommunity rather than a single pathogen, presenting many challenges forunderstanding the etiology and pathogenesis of this syndrome.  A molecular version of Koch's postulates ispresented for collecting evidence of causation for uncultivated microbes suchas those linked to BV.  There is newevidence suggesting that BV may be a biofilm condition in some women, which maycontribute to poor treatment responses and high relapse rates.  Understanding the bacterial biota of thehuman vagina is critical for optimizing reproductive health, and although manyadvances have been made, there is much that is unknown about how bacterialcommunities in the human vagina promote health and facilitate disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Tina Fiedler forconducting the broad range PCR, cloning and sequencing experiments from whichdata presented in this review has been assembled.
