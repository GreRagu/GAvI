Since ER&#x003b1; is not colocalized with the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 in the normal mammary glands and the majority of primary breast tumors, it is generally believed that paracrine regulation is involved in ER&#x003b1; mediated cell proliferation. In the paracrine model, ER&#x003b1;-positive cells don't proliferate but will release some paracrine growth factors to stimulate the neighboring cells to proliferate. In a subpopulation of cancer cells in some primary breast tumors, however, ER&#x003b1; does colocalize with the cell proliferation marker Ki-67, suggesting an autocrine regulation by ER&#x003b1; in some primary breast tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Colocalization of ER&#x003b1; with Ki-67 in ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, and ZR75-1) was evaluated by immunofluorescent staining. Cell cycle phase dependent expression of ER&#x003b1; was determined by co-immunofluorescent staining of ER&#x003b1; and the major cyclins (D, E, A, B), and by flow cytometry analysis of ER&#x003b1;<sup>high </sup>cells. To further confirm the autocrine action of ER&#x003b1;, MCF-7 cells were growth arrested by ICI182780 treatment, followed by treatment with EGFR inhibitor, before estrogen stimulation and analyses for colocalization of Ki-67 and ER&#x003b1; and cell cycle progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Colocalization of ER&#x003b1; with Ki-67 was present in all three ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines. Unlike that in the normal mammary glands and the majority of primary breast tumors, ER&#x003b1; is highly expressed throughout the cell cycle in MCF-7 cells. Without E2 stimulation, MCF-7 cells released from ICI182780 treatment remain at G1 phase. E2 stimulation of ICI182780 treated cells, however, promotes the expression and colocalization of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 as well as the cell cycle progressing through the S and G2/M phases. Inhibition of EGFR signaling does not inhibit the autocrine action of ER&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data indicate that ER&#x003b1; can mediate estrogen-induced cell proliferation in an autocrine mode in ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines. All of the three ER&#x003b1;-positive cell lines used in our study showed colocalization of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67, indicating that these cell lines might be originated from primary tumor cells with autocrine regulation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The ovarian-derived steroid hormone estrogen is one of the main regulators of mammary epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. While estrogen is required for normal mammary gland development, cumulative exposure to estrogen during a woman's lifetime is a high risk factor for breast malignancy. The action of estrogen is exerted by binding and activating the estrogen receptors, ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2;. Studies on the expression patterns of estrogen receptors and gene knock-out mouse models indicate that ER&#x003b1; is the primary estrogen receptor for mammary epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. While ER&#x003b1; is expressed exclusively in the epithelial cells, ER&#x003b2; is expressed in both epithelial and stromal cells but the expression of ER&#x003b2; in the epithelial cells is very weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In ER&#x003b2; knock-out mice, the mammary glands can still form the bronchoalveolar structure and lactate normally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In ER&#x003b1; knock-out mice, however, the mammary gland remains at rudimentary duct stage without further development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. While the role of ER&#x003b2; in breast cancer is less understood, ER&#x003b1; is one of the most known oncogenes in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Abnormal expression of ER&#x003b1; is found in about 70&#x02013;80% of human breast cancers, and about 50% of ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer patients respond to anti-estrogen therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. When overexpressed in the mammary gland epithelial cells of transgenic mice, ER&#x003b1; leads to mammary malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Despite the significant role of ER&#x003b1; in mediating estrogen-induced cell proliferation in normal mammary development and breast cancer, the mechanism is still not fully understood. In the normal mammary gland, ER&#x003b1; expression is found only in a subpopulation of the mammary epithelial cells and the percentage of ER&#x003b1;-positive cells is affected by the physiologic conditions. Unlike most other cellular receptors, ER&#x003b1; expression is not found in proliferating mammary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This observation leads to the prevailing concept that ER&#x003b1; mediates cell proliferation in a paracrine manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this paracrine model, ER&#x003b1;-positive cells don't proliferate; the ER&#x003b1;-positive cells, however, when stimulated by estrogen, will produce and release paracrine growth factors, which in turn stimulate the neighboring cells to proliferate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The EGF family member amphiregulin could be one of those important paracrine growth factors involved in ER&#x003b1;-mediated mammary gland epithelial cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is not clear why ER&#x003b1;-positive cells cannot proliferate, or why ER&#x003b1; does not stimulate cell proliferation in an autocrine mode or in both autocrine and paracrine modes. A recent study by Cheng et al. challenged the paradigm that ER&#x003b1; cannot mediate ER&#x003b1;-positive cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The authors proposed that ER&#x003b1; is degraded early in the cell cycle, which accounts for the dissociation of the ER&#x003b1;-staining and cell proliferation marker.</p><p>In contrast to the mechanism in normal mammary tissues, ER&#x003b1; might mediate cancer cell proliferation via paracrine and/or autocrine modes in primary breast cancers. In ER&#x003b1;-positive primary breast cancers, the percentage of ER&#x003b1;-staining cells varies from 10% to 50% or higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Most of the ER&#x003b1;-staining cells are not stained with Ki-67 in these ER&#x003b1;-positive primary breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In some primary breast tumors, however, ER&#x003b1; does colocalize with the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 in a sub-population of tumor cells; the percentage of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 duel-staining cells varies among different patients, from 0% to ~5% of total cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The co-staining of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 suggests that ER&#x003b1;-positive cells in these primary breast tumors might be capable of proliferating, i.e., ER&#x003b1; might be able to mediate cell proliferation via autocrine fashion in these primary breast tumor cells.</p><p>Using breast cancer cell line models, ER&#x003b1; has been shown to have non-genomic effect in addition to the traditional genomic action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In its genomic action as a transcriptional factor, ER&#x003b1; activation in MCF-7 cells can induce the expression of cyclin D and myc to promote cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. When stimulated by estrogen, the effect on cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells is usually not obvious until 5&#x02013;7 days after the stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It is not clear why the impact is delayed for such long time and that raises the question whether the activation of ER&#x003b1; alone is sufficient to drive cell cycle progression through all the phases for mitosis. For the non-genomic action of ER&#x003b1;, cell signaling initiated from the cell surface can activate multiple pathways such as the ERK and AKT pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Using the EGFR inhibitor, Levine and colleagues demonstrated that EGFR is required for the cell surface ER&#x003b1;-activated signaling transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Marks and colleagues demonstrated that inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways can prevent estrogen-induced mitogenesis in MCF-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Considering all of the information derived from different perspectives, it is very likely that MCF-7 cells and some other ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines might be regulated by ER&#x003b1; via the autocrine as well as the paracrine modes. In this study, we demonstrated that ER&#x003b1; is colocalized with Ki-67 in MCF-7, T47D, and ZR75-1 cells, the ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines used in our study. Using MCF-7 cell line, we demonstrated that ER&#x003b1; is present in all the phases of cell cycle and activation of ER&#x003b1; in G1 phase promotes cell cycle progression through mitogenesis, supporting the autocrine mode of regulation. Finally, we demonstrated that EGFR activation is not required for the autocrine regulation of cell proliferation by ER&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and antibodies</title><p>Antibodies for ER&#x003b1; (F10), Ki-67 (H-300), cyclin A (C-19), Cyclin B (H-20), cyclin D1 (H-295), cyclin E (C-19) were obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA).

For experimental assays, phenol-red free DMEM/F12 (MediaTech Inc, Herndon, VA) containing 5% CD-FBS was used unless otherwise specified. To arrest cells in G1 phase by ICI182780, cells were seeded in culture dishes for 1&#x02013;2 days to let the cells reach about 30&#x02013;40% confluency before replacement with medium containing ICI182780. To evaluate the effect of estrogen stimulation, cells were stimulated by adding E2 either after removal of ICI182780 or in the presence of ICI182780. For estrogen stimulation after removal of ICI182780, cells treated with ICI182780 were washed briefly two times with serum-free phenol red-free DMEM/F12 to remove ICI182780, followed by replacement with medium containing 5 nM estrogen but without ICI182780. The control cells were replaced with medium containing vehicle only. For estrogen stimulation in the presence of ICI182780, cells were treated with 10 nM ICI182780 for various times before adding ten fold of E2 (100 nM) to the cells without removing ICI182780. ICI182780 stock solution was made at 10 mM in DMSO, then serially diluted in DMSO to 10 &#x003bc;M before diluted in culture medium. Estrogen stock solution was made at 10 mM in ethanol, then serially diluted in ethanol to 10 &#x003bc;M before diluted in culture medium. To inhibit the EGFR activation, cells were treated with Gefitinib for 2 hr first; without removing Gefitinib, estrogen or EGF was then added to the cells for stimulation.

To study the mechanism of how cell proliferation is mediated by ER&#x003b1;, the ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines were used in our study. In all the three ER&#x003b1;-positive cell lines evaluated in this study, i.e., MCF-7, T47D, and ZR75-1, a large proportion of cells showed duel-staining of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

While these data don't exclude the possibility of a paracrine regulation of cell proliferation by ER&#x003b1; in these cells, the colocalization of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 does support the hypothesis that ER&#x003b1; may mediate cell proliferation in an autocrine mode in these ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines, a mechanism absent in normal mammary cells and most primary breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Colocalization of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 in ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines</bold>.

To further determine whether ER&#x003b1; can mediate cell proliferation in an autocrine mode, we sought to arrest the cells with the pure ER&#x003b1; antagonist ICI182780 followed by estrogen stimulation. When treated with ICI182780 for 72&#x02013;96 hrs, no cell was observed with high ER&#x003b1; expression and only a few cells were stained with Ki-67, indicating that both ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 were down-regulated by ICI182780 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

We first evaluated the effect of estrogen stimulation after removal of ICI182780. MCF-7 cells were treated for ICI182780 for 72&#x02013;96 hr and the treatment was stopped by washing with fresh serum-free medium to remove ICI182780. The cells were then stimulated with estrogen by adding medium containing 5 nM estrogen but without ICI182780. The control group of cells was replaced with medium without estrogen. In the cells stimulated with estrogen, both ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 were induced with ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 colocalized in most cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In the control group of cells without estrogen stimulation, no high level of ER&#x003b1; or Ki-67 was observed although the cells were released from ICI182780 treatment. We also determined the effect of estrogen stimulation by adding estrogen directly to the cells still under ICI182780 treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The continuous presence of ICI182780 was to help minimize the secondary factors that might promote cell proliferation. Cells were treated with 10 nM ICI182780 for 72&#x02013;96 hrs before the estrogen was added to the cells for a final concentration of 100 nM. Similar to the result shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, excessive estrogen stimulation in the presence of ICI182780 also induced the expression of high levels of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 with the two proteins colocalized in most cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that activation of ER&#x003b1; by estrogen in ICI182780 arrested cells induces the expression of high levels of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 and their colocalization, supporting the autocrine mode of ER&#x003b1; action.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>E2 stimulation of ICI182780 treated cells induced the expression and colocalization of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67</bold>.

As described above, cells were stimulated with estrogen either after release from ICI182780, or estrogen was added at 10 fold higher concentration (100 nM E2) directly to cells without removing ICI182780 (10 nM ICI). Similar results were observed for either stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, and data not shown). In cells stimulated with estrogen after release from ICI182780, most cells were still in the G1 phase until 24 hr after stimulation. At 44 hr after estrogen stimulation, about 45% of the cells were in S or G2/M phases, indicating that activation of ER&#x003b1; promotes the progressing of the cell cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Interestingly, induction of high levels of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 appeared much earlier, with high levels of ER&#x003b1; appeared at around 6 hr. It is noteworthy that high levels of ER&#x003b1; appeared earlier than Ki-67, supporting that the activation of ER&#x003b1; is mediating the expression of Ki-67 and the cell cycle progression. These data indicate that the colocalization of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 is not a coincidence and support the hypothesis that activation of ER&#x003b1; can promote cell proliferation by autocrine regulation.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Time course of E2 induced expression of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 and cell cycle progression</bold>.

Therefore we evaluated whether EGFR signaling is required for the autocrine regulation of cell proliferation by ER&#x003b1; in MCF-7 cells. EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib was used to block EGFR signaling, 20 &#x003bc;M of Gefitinib was chosen based on our preliminary experiments using a wide range concentrations of Gefitinib (1 &#x003bc;M &#x02013; 50 &#x003bc;M) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, and data not shown). We first evaluated whether Gefitinib treatment inhibits E2 stimulation induced expression and colocalization of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67. MCF-7 cells were treated first with 10 nM ICI182780 for 72&#x02013;96 hr, followed by adding the EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib to a final concentration of 20 &#x003bc;M for 2 hr, then by adding estrogen to a final concentration of 100 nM. In the presence of ICI182780 and Gefitinib, estrogen stimulation still induced the expression and colocalization of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Conceivably, Gefitinib treatment does not inhibit estrogen stimulation induced cell cycle progression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> lower panel). In the control groups of MCF-7 cells treated with ICI182780 for 72&#x02013;96 hr, ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 were down-regulated and the cells remained at G1 phase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, C</xref> upper panel). In the growth curve studies and the EGF stimulation experiments, Gefitinib at 20 &#x003bc;M is sufficient to block EGFR signaling but not toxic to the cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, and data not shown).

In breast cancer, abnormal expression of ER&#x003b1; is found in about 70% of primary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Despite the significant role of ER&#x003b1;, the mechanism of how ER&#x003b1; mediates cell proliferation is not fully understood. The dissociation of ER&#x003b1; with cell proliferation markers such as Ki-67 in the normal mammary gland leads to the paracrine model of ER&#x003b1;-mediated cell proliferation. While colocalization of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 is rare in most primary breast cancers, there do exist some cancer cells in some primary breast tumors showing colocalization of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67 suggesting the possibility of autocrine regulation. In this paper using the ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer lines, we presented data showing that most Ki-67 staining cells expressed high levels of ER&#x003b1; and that cells with high levels of ER&#x003b1; are distributed across different phases of cell cycle. We further demonstrated that activation of ER&#x003b1; in ICI182780 arrested cells can induce the expression and colocalization of high levels of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67, and more importantly, the progressing of cell cycles from G1 phase to the G2/M phases. Collectively, our data support the hypothesis that ER&#x003b1; can mediate cell proliferation in an autocrine mode in these ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines.</p><p>Whether ER&#x003b1; mediates cell proliferation by autocrine and/or paracrine regulation is related to whether ER&#x003b1;-positive cells can proliferate or not. Inferred from the paracrine model is that ER&#x003b1;-positive cells are a separate sub-population of cells that don't proliferate, or even further that ER&#x003b1;-positive cells cannot proliferate because ER&#x003b1; inhibits the proliferation of ER&#x003b1;-positive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Although ER&#x003b1; is known to promote cell proliferation in ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7, exogenous overexpression of ER&#x003b1; in some cell lines such as MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A does inhibit cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The mechanism of how ER&#x003b1; mediates cell proliferation may have clinical implication for breast cancer etiology and therapy. Malignant transformation is a multistep process that involves different combination of genes at different stage of malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Distinct sets of ER&#x003b1;-target genes might be involved for the autocrine versus paracrine regulation and it will be interesting to examine whether the resistance to endocrine-related therapy is correlated with the mode of ER&#x003b1; action.</p><p>All the three ER&#x003b1;-positive cell lines used in our study showed colocalization of ER&#x003b1; and Ki-67. Since the number of established ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines is much less than expected from the expression frequency of ER&#x003b1; in primary breast tumors, we speculated that ER&#x003b1;-positive cell lines could only be established from cancer cells with autocrine regulation in the primary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In that case, what is known about the breast cancer from the studies using the ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines may not apply to all the ER&#x003b1;-positive primary breast tumors. It needs to point out that although our data support the autocrine mode of ER&#x003b1; action, it remains to determine whether both autocrine and paracrine modes of action by ER&#x003b1; are involved in these ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines. ER&#x003b1; is expressed in both the nucleus and cell surface in MCF-7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Based on the levels of membrane ER&#x003b1;, MCF-7 cells can be separated into two sub-populations, mER&#x003b1;<sup>high </sup>and mER&#x003b1;<sup>low </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The levels of nuclear ER&#x003b1; also showed heterogeneity in MCF-7 cells. It is not clear whether the heterogeneity of nuclear ER&#x003b1; levels is caused by the differential expression of ER&#x003b1; during cell cycle progression or by the heterogeneous sub-populations of cells. As demonstrated in ICI182780 treated cells, even extremely low or basal level of ER&#x003b1; can mediate some of the cellular response to estrogen. To determine whether paracrine regulation is involved or not, a subline of MCF-7 with the ER&#x003b1; being completely shut off, i.e., eliminating the low basal level of ER&#x003b1;, will be needed to test their proliferation in response to estrogen when mixed with normal MCF-7 cells.</p><p>Together with the systemic hormones, growth factors are involved in mammary cell proliferation. EGFR signaling is essential for ER&#x003b1;-mediated cell proliferation in the normal mammary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In MCF-7 cells, EGFR is involved in the non-genomic action of ER&#x003b1; and blocking of some EGFR activated pathways could inhibit ER&#x003b1;-mediated cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Our data, however, indicate that EGFR signaling is not required for the autocrine regulation of cell proliferation by ER&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>ER&#x003b1; can mediate estrogen-induced cell proliferation in an autocrine mode in ER&#x003b1;-positive breast cancer cell lines.
