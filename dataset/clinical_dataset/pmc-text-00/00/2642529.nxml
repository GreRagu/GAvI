Epidemiological studies have reported conflicting associations between cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk. While some studies have failed to show increased breast cancer in women who smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Fink and Lash, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Lash and Aschengrau, 2002</xref>) other studies indicate a role of cigarette smoke in the etiology of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bennett <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Wells, 2000</xref>).

Chemical and animal bioassay studies indicate that tobacco smoke contains about 4,800 compounds and approximately 100 of these are carcinogens, co-carcinogens or mutagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Hecht, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Hoffmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Tobacco smoke compounds such as benzo[&#x003b1;]pyrene (B[&#x003b1;]P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">el-Bayoumy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>) and 7, 12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kumar <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>) are proven mammary carcinogens. Evidence suggests that smokers metabolize cigarette constituents in their breast tissue; nicotine and its metabolite, cotinine, have been found in the breast secretions of non-lactating, women smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Petrakis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1978</xref>) and DNA adducts have also been reported in the breast tissue of smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Perera <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). Cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) has been used as a surrogate to study the genotoxic and other effects of cigarette smoke in many model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">DeMarini, 2004</xref>). Previously, we have shown that the spontaneously immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A, is transformed by CSC in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Narayan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). MCF10A cells spontaneously arose from culturing MCF10M cells, which were derived from a 36-year old parous pre-menopausal woman with extensive fibrocystic disease, but no family history or histological evidence of breast malignancy. MCF10A cells are estrogen receptor negative (ER-) and have characteristics of normal cells including: growth factor-dependency, anchorage-dependent growth, and lack of tumorigenecity in nude mice. Therefore, these cells are considered a model for normal breast epithelial cells and provide the opportunity to study the mechanism of transformation and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Soule <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Tait <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>). After a single CSC treatment, MCF10A cells displayed transformed characteristics such as increased proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth and also showed increased expression of <italic>bcl-xl</italic> mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Narayan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Bcl-xL is an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family most closely related to the founding member anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Boise <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Grillot <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). <italic>Bcl-xl</italic> is upregulated in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors, and is considered as a marker for increased tumor grade and nodal metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Olopade <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Schott <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). The evasion of apoptosis is considered one of the six hallmarks of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000</xref>). Cells expressing Bcl-xL are more likely to survive following DNA damage and can potentially accumulate new somatic mutations at higher frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cherbonnel-Lasserre <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). The resulting persistent accumulation of damage and mutations could lead to cell cycle deregulation, transformation, and eventually carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that CSC treatment caused increased expression of Bcl-xL leading to transformation of MCF10A cells. In the present study, we determined the mechanism by which CSC causes transcriptional upregulation of <italic>bcl-xl</italic> gene expression in MCF10A cells. Our results suggest, for the first time to our knowledge, that C/EBP&#x003b2; binds the <italic>bcl-xl</italic> promoter and induces its activity in MCF10A cells in response CSC treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CSC treatment induces bcl-xl mRNA and protein levels in MCF10A cells</title><p id="P5">To determine the effect of CSC treatment on <italic>bcl-xl</italic> gene levels, we treated MCF10A cells with increasing amounts of CSC for 24 h and <italic>bcl-xl</italic> mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). In these cells after normalization with <italic>glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)</italic> mRNA, the <italic>bcl-xl</italic> mRNA expression slightly decreases at lower concentrations (2.5 &#x000b5;g/mL) and increases at higher concentrations of CSC treatment as compared to untreated cells. To confirm the subsequent induction of Bcl-xL protein levels, cells were treated with 25 &#x000b5;g/mL of CSC for different time intervals and with increasing concentrations of CSC for 24 h. Western analysis was used to determine the protein levels. The results showed an increased level of Bcl-xL protein in both time- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, upper panel</xref>) and concentration-dependent manners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B, lower panel</xref>). These results indicate that CSC treatment induces <italic>bcl-xl</italic> mRNA and protein levels in MCF10A cells. The concentration of CSC used in these experiments was in the range of 0&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;g/ml. This concentration of CSC is not as high as compared to the exposure with 10 mg of tar (CSC) present in each cigarette, which contains about 6.4 ng of benz(<italic>a</italic>)pyrene, a well-known mammary carcinogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Stabbert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In human body, components of cigarette smoke can be transported to distal organs by blood including breast. Although a critical level of carcinogens is required to trigger the process of DNA damage and carcinogenesis, it can be an accumulative effect of cigarette smoke carcinogens, instead of a single event leading to carcinogenesis in human body.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>CSC induces bcl-xl promoter activity in MCF10A cells</title><p id="P6">To determine how <italic>bcl-xl</italic> was induced by CSC, the human <italic>bcl-xl</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Grillot <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sevilla <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) was cloned into a pGL3-Basic Luciferase Vector (Promega Corp, Madison, WI) as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods and materials</xref> and was named pBcl-xLP. Transcription initiation sites were located at +1 and +78 and putative <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements on the pBcl-xLP were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Grillot <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sevilla <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). The pBcl-xLP promoter had consensus sites for several transcription factors that were reported in earlier studies, such as NF-&#x003ba;B, Oct1, Sp proteins, GATA, STAT, and others. To determine whether the pBcl-xLP was responsive to CSC treatment, promoter constructs were transfected into MCF10A cells and then the cells were treated with 25 &#x000b5;g/mL CSC for the time course (0 to 48 h) or treated with varying concentrations (0&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;g/mL) of CSC for 24 h. Promoter activity was measured with luciferase assays. The promter construct pBcl-xLP(&#x02212;145,+707) was not induced by CSC treatment (data not shown); however, the promoter construct pBcl-xLP(&#x02212;54,+647) was found to have basal promoter activity. We considered this as a wild-type promoter and will be referred to as pBcl-xLP from here onward. CSC treatment of the cells induced pBcl-xLP promoter activity in a time-dependent manner, with the highest time point of induction at 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and in a concentration-dependent manner, with the highest induction at 50 &#x000b5;g/mL of CSC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Based upon these experiments, the optimum conditions were determined to be 25 &#x000b5;g/mL concentration of CSC and 24 h of treatment time. These studies suggest that pBcl-xLP promoter activity was induced in MCF10A cells by CSC treatment in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>C/EBP-binding sites on the pBcl-xLP are responsive to CSC treatment</title><p id="P7">Putative <italic>cis</italic>-elements on the <italic>bcl-xl</italic> promoter represent possible binding sites for transcription factors that can activate or repress the transcription of this gene. To determine which transcription factor was responsive for increasing pBcl-xLP expression in treated cells, sequential deletion constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>) were transfected into MCF10A cells and treated with 25 &#x000b5;g/mL of CSC for 24 h, and promoter activity was measured. The results indicated that pBcl-xLP(&#x02212;54,+647) activity was significantly induced by CSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Basal promoter activity was reduced with pBcl-xLP(&#x02212;28,+707), which reflected the loss of the C/EBP-binding site-I, but the CSC response was maintained, suggesting that C/EBP-binding site-I was important for the basal <italic>bcl-xl</italic> promoter activity and that it may or may not have been responsive to CSC treatment. The <italic>bcl-xl</italic> promoter activity continued to decrease as other elements were deleted. However, the CSC response was maintained up to pBcl-xLP(&#x02212;28,+222). The promoter activity decreased at the next construct, pBcl-xLP(&#x02212;28,+132), which represented the loss of the C/EBP-binding site-II. The loss of this site resulted in an unrecoverable decrease in promoter activity.</p><p id="P8">To further examine whether C/EBP-binding site-I and II were necessary for CSC-induced promoter activity, we mutated these sites of the pBcl-xLP promoter by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant constructs were then transfected into MCF10A cells that were subsequently treated with CSC. While the wild-type promoter showed a significant induction of activity in response to CSC treatment, neither mutant promoter constructs showed a significant change in response to treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). These results indicate that C/EBP-binding site-I and II might be CSC-responsive element on the pBcl-xLP in MCF10A cells.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>C/EBP&#x003b2; binds to the pBcl-xLP in MCF10A cells in vitro and in vivo</title><p id="P9">Two putative C/EBP sites on the pBcl-xLP were identified as being inducible by CSC. C/EBP&#x003b2; is one of the six C/EBP proteins and evidence suggests that it has role in human breast carcinogenesis; however, this role is not completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Milde-Langosch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Zahnow, 2002</xref>). Its putative role in human breast carcinogenesis made C/EBP&#x003b2; an appropriate target protein responsible for the upregulation in <italic>bcl-xl</italic> in CSC-treated MCF10A cells. Western analysis was used to confirm that C/EBP&#x003b2; was induced by CSC treatment. Two C/EBP&#x003b2; isoforms LAP1 (45-kDa) and LAP2 (42-kDa) were detected in whole cell extracts from CSC-treated MCF10A cells; however, LIP (20-kDa) was poorly expressing and could not be detected in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B and C</xref>). Only LAP2 levels were significantly increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B and C</xref>, respectively). These experiments suggested that C/EBP&#x003b2; protein levels are induced by CSC treatment.</p><p id="P10">Then we used electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA) to characterize the C/EBP-binding proteins binding to the pBcl-xLP promoter in response to CSC treatment. For these experiments, <sup>32</sup>P-labelled double-stranded probes, identical to C/EBP-binding site-I and site-II sequences were incubated with MCF10A nuclear extract. Two DNA-protein complexes (shifted bands-I and -II) were visualized with autoradiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). These bands represented nuclear proteins binding to the C/EBP regulatory elements on the <italic>bcl-xl</italic> promoter. To further determine the binding specificity of nuclear proteins with C/EBP-binding site-I and II oligonucleotides, the competition experiments were performed with molar excess of appropriate unlabelled wild-type or mutant oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). For C/EBP-binding site-I and II, the unlabelled wild-type oligonucleotide competed out the <sup>32</sup>P-labelled probe, in a concentration-dependent manner, as expected. However, the unlabelled C/EBP site-I mutant oligonucleotide also competed out the <sup>32</sup>P-labelled probe. This indicated one of the two scenarios: 1) the mutant is not sufficient enough to decrease binding, or 2) the binding at this site is non-specific. Further specificity was tested by adding increasing concentrations of a nonspecific, unlabelled GAGA probe to the reactions as indicated. The unlabelled probe also competed with the <sup>32</sup>P-labelled wild-type probe for C/EBP-binding site-I, confirming that binding to C/EBP site-I was non-specific. Conversely, the binding at C/EBP-binding site-II was not competed out by either the unlabelled mutant or the unlabelled nonspecific GAGA oligonucleotide, suggesting that MCF10A nuclear extract contained a protein that specially bound to C/EBP-binding site-II.</p><p id="P11">The protein binding to C/EBP-binding site-II was further confirmed with super-shift analysis. The three C/EBP proteins (C/EBP&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b4;) are expressed in mammary tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Gigliotti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Sabatakos <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). To determine whether the binding was specific to either protein, antibodies specific to each were added to the reaction mixtures. No super-shifted bands are observed in reactions with the <sup>32</sup>P-C/EBP-binding site-I. <sup>32</sup>P-C/EBP-binding site-II reactions showed a super-shifted band only with the addition of anti-C/EBP&#x003b2; antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, compare lane 5 with 6).</p><p id="P12">The effects of CSC treatment on super-shift analysis were also analyzed at C/EBP site-II. Reactions containing nuclear extract from either control or CSC-treated MCF10A cells were assembled. With control nuclear extract, addition of anti-C/EBP&#x003b2; antibody resulted in a super-shift similar to the one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>, compare lane 1 with 2). CSC treatment shifted band-I and showed an increased binding at shifted band-II, indicating an increased level of C/EBP-binding proteins after CSC treatment. The shifted band-I with the nuclear extract from CSC-treated cells as compared to the control cells could have been due to post-translational modification in the C/EBP-binding proteins. The addition of anti-C/EBP&#x003b2; antibody caused an additional super-shift of band-I with nuclear extract of control cells and showed a little super-shift with the nuclear extract of CSC-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>, compare lane 1 with 2 and 3 with 4, respectively). There was no super-shift with anti-C/EBP&#x003b2; antibody of band-II with the nuclear extract of CSC-treated cells. These experiments confirmed that C/EBP&#x003b2; specifically binds only to the C/EBP-binding site-II on the pBcl-xLP and its binding is increased by CSC treatment, indicating that the C/EBP site-II is the target of CSC-mediated upregulation of <italic>bcl-xl</italic> gene expression.</p><p id="P13">To confirm that C/EBP&#x003b2; binds the <italic>bcl-xl</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, MCF10A cells were treated with increasing concentrations of CSC for 24 h and ChIP analysis was performed as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Material and Methods</xref>. PCR of the resulting DNA was performed with primers specific to the pBcl-xLP C/EBP-binding site-II. The control cells had an initial binding of C/EBP&#x003b2; to the <italic>bcl-xl</italic> promoter.

Each C/EBP&#x003b2; construct induced promoter activity; however, only hLAP2 had a significant induction when compared to the empty pCDNA3.1 vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B</xref>). To determine the effect on Bcl-xL protein levels, each construct was separately transfected into MC10A cells. After the overexpression, cells were processed for Western analysis of C/EBP&#x003b2; isoforms and Bcl-xL protein levels. A very efficient overexpression of C/EBP&#x003b2; isoforms, hLAP1, hLAP2 and hLIP, were observed in MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). The Bcl-xL protein levels were similar in control cells and cells transfected with the empty pCDNA3.1 vector. The overexpression of hLAP1 slightly increased Bcl-xL protein levels, while LAP2 showed the most significant increase of Bcl-xL. Conversely, hLIP expression caused a decrease in Bcl-xL protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>). LIP acts as a transcriptional dominant negative factor of hLAP1 and hLAP2 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Descombes and Schibler, 1991</xref>). In our experiments, results showed its dominant negative effect as the overexpression of hLIP decreases the expression of hLAP1 and hLAP2 in MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bundy et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Next, we determined whether the C/EBP-binding site-I and/or II are responsive to the overexpression of C/EBP&#x003b2; isoforms. We co-transfected C/EBP-binding site-I or II mutant pBcl-xL plasmid with one of the C/EBP&#x003b2; isoforms overexpressiong plasmids. The results showed that the overexpression of C/EBP&#x003b2; isoforms with pBcl-xLP mutants disrupted the promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A and B</xref>). Although mutations in both C/EBP-binding site-I and II abolished the hLAP2- mediated pBcl-xLP promoter activity, the effect was more prominent at mutations on C/EBP-binding site-II, which is consistent with gel-shift, ChIP analysis, and overexpression results. The decreased activity of C/EBP-binding site-I mutant pBcl-xLP promoter by hLIP overexpression could be due to its dominant negative effect with hLAP2 on C/EBP-binding site-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>). The effect of hLIP overexpression becomes less prominent when used with C/EBP-binding site-II mutant pBcl-xLP promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref>). Thus, the presence of C/EBP-binding site-II was important for the CSC-induced and C/EBP&#x003b2;-induced upregulation of <italic>bcl-xl</italic> promoter activity in MCF10A cells. Taken together these data indicated that C/EBP&#x003b2;, especially LAP2 was necessary for the upregulation of <italic>bcl-xl</italic> and mimics CSC treatment in MCF10A cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P16">In a previous study, CSC-induced transformation of MCF10A cells has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Narayan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In this study, the MCF10A cell line was utilized to determine the mechanism by which cigarette smoke exposure might be linked to transformation and breast carcinogenesis. Among several aspects that might play a role in CSC-induced transformation of normal breast epithelial cells such as compromised DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kundu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), increased expression of neuropilin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Narayan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and decreased expression of S100A2 (Feng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001), we focused on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of anti-apoptotic gene, <italic>bcl-xl</italic>. The <italic>bcl-xl</italic> mRNA and protein levels were increased in MCF10A cells after CSC treatment, which was consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Narayan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The increase in <italic>bcl-xl</italic> mRNA occurred through a biphasic mechanism. The base-line levels of <italic>bcl-xl</italic> in untreated cells ensured the survival of the cells in culture. CSC causes DNA damage in MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kundu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and they respond by triggering DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Narayan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). DNA damage overloads the repair mechanisms and most cells underwent apoptosis, resulting in the decrease in <italic>bcl-xl</italic> mRNA levels after the first treatment. The surviving cells were responsible for the remaining low levels of <italic>bcl-xl</italic> expression after the initial treatment. Cells expressing higher levels of <italic>bcl-xl</italic> were not removed by apoptosis and subsequent treatments produced more DNA damage, persistent mutations, and the interruption of important cell regulatory mechanisms. As a result, <italic>bcl-xl</italic> expression continued to increase in a concentration-dependent manner.</p><p id="P17">Then, we determined whether the increased <italic>bcl-xl</italic> mRNA level by CSC treatment was at the transcriptional level. To determine CSC-induced transcriptional mechanism, we used a <italic>luciferase</italic>-reporter assay system for these studies. Human <italic>bcl-xl</italic> gene&#x02019;s promoter cloned into the <italic>luciferase</italic>-reporter gene (pBcl-xLP) was responsive to CSC treatment when transfected into MCF10A cells. Promoter deletion studies suggested that two C/EBP <italic>cis</italic>-elements were responsible for the most significant CSC-induced increase in promoter activity. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that CSC-induced pBcl-xLP activity was attenuated in the absence of both C/EBP-binding sites, and the protein levels of C/EBP&#x003b2; were induced by CSC treatment. However, EMSA confirmed that C/EBP&#x003b2; bound only to the <italic>bcl-xl</italic> promoter at C/EBP-binding site-II and CSC treatment increased C/EBP&#x003b2;-binding only to C/EBP-binding site-II <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. This result is not surprising because C/EBP-binding site-I has parts of the consensus sequence, while C/EBP-binding site-II, contains 100% of the core C/EBP consensus sequence. Overexpression studies also confirmed that the ectopic expression of C/EBP&#x003b2; induced pBcl-xLP promoter and Bcl-xL proteins levels. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that C/EBP-binding sites on the pBcl-xLP were necessary for C/EBP&#x003b2; to properly regulate pBcl-xLP activity.</p><p id="P18">C/EBP&#x003b2; expression is a critical component in the control of mammary epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation in the functional mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Robinson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Seagroves <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). C/EBP&#x003b2; is increased in human breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Eaton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Milde-Langosch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>); however, the mechanism(s) by which it influences breast carcinogenesis is not well established. In the present study, only C/EBP&#x003b2;-LAP2 protein levels were induced in time- and concentration-dependent manner following CSC treatment. Additionally, only LAP2 significantly induced pBcl-xLP activity and Bcl-xL protein levels. Although C/EBP&#x003b2;-LAP2 has not been fully implicated in human breast carcinogenesis, studies support its role in the disease. LAP2 is the most prevalent form of C/EBP&#x003b2; in human breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Eaton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) and the overexpression of C/EBP&#x003b2;-LAP2 has been implicated in the transformation of human breast epithelial cells. MCF10A cells infected with a LAP2-expressing virus became anchorage independent, expressed markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), acquired invasive phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bundy and Sealy, 2003</xref>), gained epidermal growth factor (EGF)-independent growth, and had disruption of normal acinar structure when grown on basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Bundy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). These studies suggest that aberrant expression of C/EBP&#x003b2; isoforms, especially LAP2, contributes to breast carcinogenesis.</p><p id="P19">The following model is proposed as a starting point to uncovering the role of C/EBP&#x003b2; in the upregulation of <italic>bcl-xl</italic> in MCF10A cells treated with CSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C</xref>). When human breast epithelial cells are exposed to CSC, cells are damaged and most undergo cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Narayan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In the few surviving cells, C/EBP&#x003b2; protein is activated by an unknown mechanism, triggering the dimerization of two C/EBP&#x003b2;-LAP2 monomers. These homodimers bind to C/EBP site-II on the <italic>bcl-xl</italic> promoter and transcriptionally activate the mRNA and subsequent protein expression levels of Bcl-xL. Increased levels of Bcl-xL impede the apoptotic pathway, allowing for the accumulation of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Mendez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Mendez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). When genes involved in DNA repair or the apoptotic pathway are also altered, the accumulation of DNA damage can lead to cell cycle deregulation. Disruption of apoptotic pathways, may also allow for damaged cells to survive and acquire the characteristics of transformed cells. Cells overexpressing Bcl-xL can adapt to new microenvironments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Espana <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fernandez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Mendez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rubio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), have increased potential to metastasize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fernandez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Rubio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) and are also more prone to be resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Cherbonnel-Lasserre <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Datta <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Fernandez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Simonian <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).

C/EBP&#x003b2;-LAP2 homodimers form and bind to C/EBP-binding site-II on the <italic>bcl-xl</italic> promoter, positively activating its transcription. Increased levels of Bcl-xL protein prevents damaged cells from being removed by apoptosis. Persistent DNA damage in these cells leads genetic alterations, transformation of normal epithelial cells, and eventually breast carcinogenesis. During carcinogenesis, Bcl-xL expression is linked to metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy which affect tumor progression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms75030f8"/></fig></sec></back></article>
