Early changes in the disease process are very important, and unraveling more of the initial steps in pathogenesis may afford patients better management possibilities and an improved prognosis. Determining the molecular mechanism of the pathogenesis of ADPKD, including the early period of cyst formation, requires investigation of changes from before the earliest period of disease manifestation in a defined animal model that mimics the human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. One well-used approach to unravel the molecular pathogenesis and pharmacology of metabolic and genetic diseases is the cDNA microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We have previously developed an animal model of ADPKD by generating <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup><italic>L</italic>3/<italic>L</italic>3 </sup>mutant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Homozygous <italic>Pkd1 </italic>null mice appear normal when born, but rapidly develop polycystic kidneys and generally do not live longer than 3.5 to 4 weeks. Here we refined the genetic background of our <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup><italic>L</italic>3/<italic>L</italic>3 </sup>mutant mice so that the disease more closely resembles most human ADPKD individuals in the late onset of symptoms and final progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This refined animal model will facilitate the study of ADPKD progression and the evaluation of possible treatments. In this paper we present the gene expression profile of <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup><italic>L</italic>3/<italic>L</italic>3 </sup>mice and their normal littermates at different time points, as determined by cDNA microarray. The materials and methods used in this study were described detail in the additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup><italic>L</italic>3/<italic>L</italic>3 </sup>Mice on a Congenic C57BL/6 Background</title><p>During the course of refinement of the genetic background of the ADPKD model mice to a congenic C57BL/6 genetic background, an earlier onset of polycystic kidney phenotype (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) was seen than with the previous mice on the SV129/C57BL6 background. Histological examination revealed that the translucent enlarged kidneys were due to the formation of numerous large cysts in homozygous mutant mice. Smaller cysts formed early in PNW 1, and became larger at PNW 2. The cysts were disseminated and distributed cross the cortex and medulla. At PNW 3.5, the cyst occupied the entire kidney and normal kidney architecture was hardly seen (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2C</xref>). All <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup><italic>L</italic>3/<italic>L</italic>3 </sup>mice were born normally, but most of them did not survive past four weeks (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3A</xref>) in the congenic C57BL/6 background. In gross appearance, there was no difference between <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup><italic>L</italic>3/<italic>L</italic>3 </sup>mice and their age-matched control littermates at PNW 1, but <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup><italic>L</italic>3/<italic>L</italic>3 </sup>mice were shorter of stature with a slightly wider abdomen by PNW 2, and more obviously so by PNW 3 (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2A</xref>). On necropsy, these homozygous mutant mice had much enlarged and translucent kidneys compared to their heterozygous or wild-type littermates (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2B</xref>). The gross kidney alterations were first seen at PNW 2 and became more severe at later time points. Although the body weight was only moderately reduced in homozygous mutants (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3B</xref>), there was a large increase in kidney weight/body weight ratio (kw/bw) (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3C</xref>) and kidney volume (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3D</xref>) in homozygous mutant mice. Similar changes in kidney volume were seen in <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup><italic>L</italic>3/<italic>L</italic>3 </sup>mice compared to the control littermates. Renal function was also severely impaired in homozygous mutant mice as evidenced in the progressive rise in BUN (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Overview of Temporal Expression Profile of <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup><italic>L</italic>3/<italic>L</italic>3 </sup>Kidney</title><p>To study the detailed gene expression profile of ADPKD, we generated and compared gene expression profiles of <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup><italic>L</italic>3/<italic>L</italic>3 </sup>mice and their aged-matched wild-type littermates at different stages, i.e. PNW 1, 2, 3 and 3.5.</p><p>There were significant differences in expression profile seen at all timepoints examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). 4,231 genes were found to be differentially expressed in the <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup><italic>L</italic>3/<italic>L</italic>3 </sup>kidney at one or more timepoint (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>), and these genes were assigned to one of 16 functional categories (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) based on a previous classification.

Several distinct early expression signatures of differentially expressed genes with potential roles in cystogenesis were identified. These genes are involved in several pathways including cell proliferation, apoptosis, transport, and immune defenses. A variety of biochemical pathways are clearly involved in the pathogenesis of ADPKD, both in initial cystogenesis and throughout disease progression, with extensive crosstalk between different pathways. Further investigation of these genes and their associated networks may provide insight into the possible pathogenic mechanisms of ADPKD development, and identify potential diagnostic and prognostic markers and novel therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WCC and HL were involved in designing the study.
