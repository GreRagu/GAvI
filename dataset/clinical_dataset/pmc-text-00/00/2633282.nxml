They form homo or heteromeric trimers with each monomer consisting of intracellular amino and carboxy termini, two transmembrane domains and a large glycosylated extracellular region containing five disulphide bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and the agonist binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Mammalian species possess seven distinct P2X subtypes (P2X<sub>1&#x02013;7</sub>) that play important roles in a wide range of physiological processes including neurotransmission, platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contractility and bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Many studies have also described potential roles for ATP as an extracellular signalling molecule in a range of invertebrate phyla [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] leading to the assumption that ATP is a primitive signalling molecule and that the emergence of purinergic receptors occurred relatively early in evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This assumption is supported by the definitive molecular and functional identification of P2X receptors in the slime mould <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the green alga <italic>Ostreococcus tauri </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the choanoflagellate <italic>Monosiga brevicollis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, several non-vertebrate organisms for which full genome data are available lack P2X-like genes, including <italic>Anopheles gambiae, Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>. Arthropods and nematodes are members of the protostome superphylum Ecdysozoa. Given that P2X receptors are present in choanoflagellates, believed to be the sister group to the Metazoa, and in some representatives of the protostome superphylum Lophotrochozoa including <italic>Schistosoma mansoni </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and <italic>Lymnaea stagnalis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the absence of P2X receptors from the above fully sequenced nematode and arthropod genomes suggests a loss of this class of gene in an ancestor of the Ecdysozoa.</p><p>We identified a partial P2X-like sequence in expressed sequence tag (EST) data from the tardigrade <italic>Hypsibius dujardini</italic>. Tardigrades are microscopic animals around 200 to 500 &#x003bc;m in length that inhabit both marine and fresh water habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. They possess a fascinating ability to desiccate into a reversible state of metabolic suspension called cryptobiosis allowing them to survive for many decades in harsh environments, such as lack of oxygen, extremes in temperature, and high pressure, before rehydration to an active state within minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Tardigrades are placed in their own phylum, Tardigrada and share features with both arthropods and nematodes. Like arthropods they possess legs and a distinctly segmented body. However they also have a triradiate pharynx more reminiscent of the nematodes. Indeed, molecular phylogenetic analyses support tardigrades as part of the Ecdysozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Functional confirmation that tardigrades possess P2X receptors would expand our emerging knowledge of P2X phylogeny and better estimate the pattern of loss of P2X in nematodes and arthropods. Furthermore, a better understanding of P2X receptor function in simple invertebrate organisms may help shed new light on structure-function aspects of human P2X receptors in health and disease by virtue of conservation of functionally important amino acid residues between evolutionary remote P2X receptors and the identification of novel P2X mediated signalling pathways. The aim of this present work therefore was to determine whether the <italic>Hypsibius dujardini </italic>EST sequence corresponds to a gene encoding a functional P2X receptor and to determine its pharmacological properties. This was achieved by expression of cRNA encoding the <italic>Hypsibius dujardini </italic>P2X gene in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes to enable two electrode voltage clamp recordings of ATP evoked membrane currents. Using this approach we show that the <italic>Hypsibius dujardini </italic>EST sequence does indeed code a functional P2X receptor with fast activation and desensitisation kinetics and similar to some vertebrate P2X channels, is potentiated by ivermectin and inhibited by zinc and copper.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sequence analysis of HdP2X</title><p>Existing EST data for clone Hd_mx23_13F10 consisted of 330 bp from the 5' end of a cDNA showing similarity to vertebrate P2X receptors. Sequencing of the full insert of this clone showed that it contained an insert of 1743 bp with an open reading frame of 1440 bp. The nucleotide sequence of this cDNA has been submitted to the GenBank database [<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU979525">EU979525</ext-link>]. The coding sequence of <italic>Hd</italic>P2X is 480 amino acids in length and is predicted to contain intracellular amino and carboxy termini and two transmembrane helices (residues 47 &#x02013; 67 and 345 &#x02013; 365) by the TopPred algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

However, phylogenetic analysis of the <italic>Hd</italic>P2X protein alongside vertebrate and other P2X sequences suggests that, like other invertebrate P2X receptor proteins, <italic>Hd</italic>P2X does not appear to be a member of any of the seven vertebrate P2X receptor subtypes, but instead represents an ortholog to the ancestor of the vertebrate paralog groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Histidine residues have previously been reported to be involved in zinc and copper inhibition of the P2X<sub>7 </sub>receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and also in the potentiation of P2X<sub>2 </sub>receptor currents by zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Three histidine residues are present in the extracellular region of <italic>Hd</italic>P2X and we therefore mutated these residues to alanine both individually and in combination with each other in order to probe their potential involvement in metal ion binding. Using 100 &#x003bc;M zinc as a test concentration, wild type currents evoked by 100 &#x003bc;M ATP (~EC<sub>80</sub>) were inhibited by 59.3 &#x000b1; 2.2%. The inhibition observed for the single histidine mutants H232A, H252A and H306A and the double histidine mutants H232A/H252A, H252A/H306A and H232A/H306A was not significantly different from wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The triple histidine mutant H232A/H252A/H306A produced a non functional channel and therefore could not be studied. With copper (100 &#x003bc;M) as the inhibitor, wild type currents were inhibited by 81.0 &#x000b1; 2.3%. Similar to zinc, the inhibition observed in the single histidine and the H232A/H252A double mutant with copper did not significantly differ from wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The inhibition observed with the double mutants H232A/H306A and H252A/H306A however was less than wild type (p &#x0003c; 0.05) with H232A/H306A currents inhibited by 60.0 &#x000b1; 3.9% and H252A/H306A currents inhibited by 50.7 &#x000b1; 8.9%. In order to assess whether mutation had resulted in a gross change in channel function, the potency of ATP for each histidine mutation was assessed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) and none of the single or double mutations produced a concentration response curve that differed significantly from wild type. Lysine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid residues are also potential candidates for coordinating metal binding and a glutamic acid residue in rat P2X<sub>7 </sub>has been shown to be involved in zinc and copper binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We therefore mutated lysine and negatively charged residues in <italic>Hd</italic>P2X that were specific between <italic>Hd</italic>P2X and <italic>S. mansoni </italic>P2X since this channel is also sensitive to metal ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Five alanine substitution mutations were created (K297A, E249A, D183A, K130A and E110A) and tested for sensitivity to zinc and copper inhibition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). No significant difference from the wild type inhibition for either zinc or copper was observed in any of these charged amino acid mutations.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Hd</italic>P2X receptor currents are inhibited by zinc and copper</bold>.

Additional partial and predicted P2X-like proteins can be identified in EST and partial genome data from other animals, including additional molluscs, echinoderms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and cnidaria. These data provide an emerging phylogenetic understanding of the evolution of ionotropic purinergic signalling. Alignment of P2X proteins from a diverse range of taxa with the mammalian P2X<sub>(1&#x02013;7) </sub>families (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) clearly shows that the mammalian P2X receptors are a lineage-specific gene expansion, with ortholog triplets evident in mouse, human and rat. A lineage-specific expansion is also evident in <italic>D. discoideum</italic>. In the other taxa, the single P2X receptors identified appear to be orthologous to the entire vertebrate expansion. This strongly suggests that the emergence of a family of seven mammalian P2X receptors was a relatively recent evolutionary event that occurred subsequent to the split between vertebrates and invertebrates. The functional confirmation that P2X receptors exist in the tardigrade <italic>H. dujardini </italic>strongly suggests that the loss of P2X receptors in some nematode (represented by <italic>C. elegans</italic>) and arthropod (represented by the sequenced hexapod genomes) species occurred independently, as both traditional and molecular phylogenies place the divergence between Nematoda and Arthropoda before their divergence from Tardigrada. Pharmacological evidence for purinergic signalling in some nematode and arthropod species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] suggests that P2X-like receptors may have been maintained in some members of these phyla. Indeed a partial transcript for a P2X gene from the nematode <italic>Xiphinema index </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] suggests that the loss of P2X in <italic>C. elegans </italic>may have occurred relatively late in nematode evolution, and P2X-like ESTs from the chelicerate <italic>Boophilus microplus </italic>similarly suggest that the loss of P2X receptors in arthropods may be restricted to Hexapoda.</p><p>Based on their kinetic parameters and ligand sensitivity, mammalian P2X receptors can be divided into three groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Group 1 consists of P2X<sub>1 </sub>and P2X<sub>3 </sub>receptors that have high sensitivity for ATP (EC<sub>50 </sub>~1&#x02013;3 &#x003bc;M) and show rapid channel activation and desensitisation during the continued presence of agonist. Group 2 includes P2X<sub>2</sub>, P2X<sub>4</sub>, P2X<sub>5</sub>, and P2X<sub>6 </sub>receptors with a lower sensitivity for ATP (EC<sub>50 </sub>~10 &#x003bc;M) and much slower desensitization whilst group 3 is represented by P2X<sub>7 </sub>which has a very low sensitivity for ATP (EC <sub>50 </sub>~300 &#x003bc;M) and shows little desensitization. <italic>Hd</italic>P2X displays an unusual phenotype in that it has a relatively low sensitivity for ATP (EC<sub>50 </sub>~44.5 &#x003bc;M) but has very fast activation and desensitisation kinetics. This is interesting from a mechanistic point of view regarding the relationship between channel gating and agonist binding since it demonstrates that that fast channel kinetics do not necessarily have to be associated with a high agonist sensitivity. Similar to <italic>Hd</italic>P2X, a P2X<sub>3</sub>-like receptor from Zebrafish has also been shown to combine fast current kinetics with low sensitivity to ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, unlike <italic>Hd</italic>P2X (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) current amplitudes at the Zebrafish channel never fully recover from the first stimulation. Other lower organism P2X receptors that have been characterised to date have all displayed slow rates of desensitisation making <italic>Hd</italic>P2X the first example of a non vertebrate P2X channel with fast kinetics. Given that it is likely that a fast phenotype evolved independently in P2X<sub>1,3 </sub>and <italic>Hd</italic>P2X channels, it will be interesting to determine whether the same factors determine the rates of current activation and desensitisation in these evolutionary remote channels.</p><p><italic>Hd</italic>P2X contains several amino acid residues that are highly conserved throughout the vertebrate P2X receptor family. The ten conserved cysteine residues present in the extracellular loop of all vertebrate P2X receptors are thought to form five disulphide bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and these residues are also present in <italic>Hd</italic>P2X suggesting conservation of gross extracellular structure constrained by disulphide bond location. It is interesting to note that the P2X receptors from <italic>O. tauri </italic>and <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] possess only eight of these ten conserved cysteine residues in their putative extracellular regions and that in each case the two absent cysteines correspond to a proposed disulphide bond pairing in the human P2X<sub>1 </sub>receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] (the equivalents of hP2X<sub>1 </sub>C217 and C227 are absent in <italic>O. tauri </italic>and C117 and C165 are absent in <italic>M. brevicollis</italic>). The agonist binding site of P2X receptors is distinct from other ATP-binding proteins and is thought to be formed from the interaction between adjacent subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Based on site directed mutagenesis combined with methanethiosulfonate reactivity a core common mode of action of ATP binding at P2X receptors has been proposed consisting of lysine residues adjacent to the transmembrane domains coordinating phosphate binding, an NFR motif binding the adenine/ribose moiety and an FT motif also involved in agonist action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The lysine residues, NFR and FT motifs are also present in <italic>Hd</italic>P2X (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) suggesting that this mechanism of ATP binding arose relatively early in evolution and is not restricted to mammalian receptors. However, the NFR motif and the equivalent of hP2X<sub>1 </sub>K68 are absent in the <italic>D. discoideum </italic>P2XA receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the FT motif is YT in <italic>S. mansoni </italic>P2X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and the NFR motif is NIR in the <italic>O. tauri </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] receptor suggesting that conservation of the residues involved in ATP binding is not universal to all P2X receptors. Residues at positions D280 and R278 in the rat P2X<sub>4 </sub>receptor have also been shown to play an important role in the action of ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These residues are also conserved in <italic>Hd</italic>P2X, <italic>S. mansoni </italic>P2X and <italic>M. brevicollis </italic>P2X suggesting that, despite their incomplete conservation amongst the seven mammalian P2X subtypes, these two residues may also play an important role in the formation of the ATP binding site in some P2X receptor subtypes. Interestingly, the only feature with complete conservation across all vertebrate and lower organism P2X receptors characterised to date is a consensus protein kinase C phosphorylation site in the N-terminal tail of the receptor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This putative phosphorylation site has been shown to regulate desensitisation in both P2X<sub>1 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and P2X<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] receptors however, surprisingly direct phosphorylation of this site has been shown not to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Unlike the <italic>D. discoideum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and <italic>O. tauri </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] P2X receptors, the general P2 receptor antagonists suramin and PPADS both inhibited <italic>Hd</italic>P2X receptor currents in a concentration dependent manner. PPADS at 100 &#x003bc;M effectively blocked ATP evoked currents. Suramin however was less potent and a component of the current was resistant to antagonism by suramin even at high concentrations. At the highest concentration tested (300 &#x003bc;M) only ~75% of the 100 &#x003bc;M ATP-evoked current was blocked. These properties are opposite to those of the <italic>S. mansoni </italic>P2X, which was more potently inhibited by suramin and incompletely blocked by PPADS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The presence of a lysine residue at position 246 in rat P2X<sub>2 </sub>and at equivalent positions in other mammalian subunits has been proposed to be involved in the inhibition of P2X receptors by PPADS, possibly forming a Schiff base with the aldehyde group of PPADS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Similarly a lysine residue at position 138 in human P2X<sub>1 </sub>has recently been shown to play a key role in the binding of suramin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Neither of these lysine residues shown to be involved in PPADS and suramin action at mammalian receptors are conserved in either <italic>Hd</italic>P2X or <italic>S. mansoni </italic>P2X suggesting that additional residues in the ectodomain also play key roles in the mechanism of antagonist binding.</p><p><italic>Hd</italic>P2X is inhibited by both copper and zinc in a concentration dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The effects of these metal ions on vertebrate P2X receptors differ markedly with P2X<sub>1 </sub>being inhibited by zinc, P2X<sub>7 </sub>inhibited by both zinc and copper, P2X<sub>2 </sub>potentiated by both zinc and copper and P2X<sub>4 </sub>potentiated by zinc but inhibited by copper (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]). The action of these metal ions at P2X receptors has physiological significance since both zinc and copper are stored in presynaptic terminals and released after nerve stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In addition to <italic>Hd</italic>P2X, the modulation of P2X receptors by metal ions is also present in other lower organisms with <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>P2X inhibited by copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and <italic>S. mansoni </italic>P2X inhibited by zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Several mutagenic studies have identified amino acid residues involved in metal binding in P2X<sub>2, 4 and 7 </sub>receptors (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]) however, no consensus binding site has emerged showing independent evolution of metal binding sites among the different vertebrate P2X receptor subtypes. Histidine residues appear to be a common feature in metal binding sites in P2X<sub>2, 4 and 7 </sub>receptors (reviewed by[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]) and in rat P2X<sub>2</sub>, H120 and H213 have been shown to form an intersubunit zinc binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. There are three extracellular histidine residues present in <italic>Hd</italic>P2X and we mutated each of these residues, both individually and in combination with each other, to alanine in order to assess their involvement in metal binding. Surprisingly, none of the extracellular <italic>Hd</italic>P2X histidine residues are essential for inhibition by zinc or copper (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This demonstrates that the mechanisms by which metal ions can influence the properties of P2X receptor function are not restricted to interactions with histidine residues. However, mutation of H306 in combination with either H252 or H232 did produce a significant reduction in copper but not zinc inhibition. This suggests that H306 plays a minor but non critical role in the formation of the copper binding site and that the copper and zinc binding sites in <italic>Hd</italic>P2X are distinct from one another. Distinct zinc and copper binding sites are also likely for P2X<sub>4 </sub>which is potentiated by zinc but inhibited by copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Of the currently identified vertebrate and lower organism P2X receptors only human and rat P2X<sub>4 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and <italic>S. mansoni </italic>P2X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] are known to be potentiated by the semi synthetic macrocyclic lactone ivermectin. Both P2X<sub>4 </sub>and <italic>S. mansoni </italic>P2X have a slow current phenotype and it is therefore interesting with respect to the mechanism of ivermectin action that <italic>Hd</italic>P2X which has very fast current activation and desensitisation kinetics is also potentiated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Ivermectin does not affect the kinetics of desensitization of <italic>Hd</italic>P2X currents, a feature also observed in <italic>S. mansoni </italic>P2X. However, in human P2X<sub>4</sub>, ivermectin confers a slower rate of desensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Ivermectin is thought to have an allosteric mode of action by increasing maximum current when binding to a high affinity site on the receptor to stabilise the open state, whereas binding to a low affinity site is proposed to slow the rate of deactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. More recently it was proposed that during gating TM1 rotates relative to TM2, and ivermectin is able to access the lipid environment and optimally bind to a hydrophobic crevice created by TM1 and TM2 at the protein-lipid interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Interestingly several hydrophobic-nonpolar residues in both TM1 and TM2 that have been shown to be involved in the action of ivermectin at P2X<sub>4 </sub>are conserved in <italic>S. mansoni </italic>P2X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and these hydrophobic-nonpolar residues are mostly also present <italic>Hd</italic>P2X. Future investigations comparing the mode of ivermectin action in both naturally fast and slow desensitising P2X channels may enhance our understanding of the process of gating and motions of the channel pore.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The identification and pharmacological characterisation of a P2X receptor from <italic>H. dujardini </italic>provides further evidence that P2X receptors for ATP emerged early in eukaryotic evolution.
