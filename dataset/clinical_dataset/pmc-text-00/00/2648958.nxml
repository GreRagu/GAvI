Alteration of this complex during pathological events leads to an impaired epithelial barrier by perturbation of the cell-cell adhesion system. Although clinical and experimental data indicate that prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) plays a critical function in promoting cell motility and cancer progression, little is known concerning its role in AJC disassembly, an event that takes place at the beginning of colorectal tumorigenesis. Using Caco-2 cells, a cell line derived from human colorectal cancer, we investigated the effects of prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) treatment on AJC assembly and function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Exposition of Caco-2 cells to PGE<sub>2 </sub>promoted differential alteration of AJC protein distribution, as evidenced by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analysis and impairs the barrier function, as seen by a decrease in the transepithelial electric resistance and an increase in the permeability to ruthenium red marker. We demonstrated the involvement of EP1 and EP2 prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>receptor subtypes in the modulation of the AJC disassembly caused by prostanoid. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase-C, but not PKA and p38MAPK significantly prevented the PGE<sub>2 </sub>effects on the AJC disassembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings strongly suggest a central role of Prostaglandin E2-EP1 and EP2 receptor signaling to mediate AJC disassembly through a mechanism that involves PKC and claudin-1 as important target for the TJ-related effects in human colorectal cancer cells (Caco-2).</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Tight junctions (TJs) and the subjacent adherens junctions (AJs) constitute the apical junctional complex (AJC), which is responsible to maintain the epithelial phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. TJs form a semi-permeable diffusion barrier in an ion- and size- selective manner through the paracellular pathway and have a fence function to maintain cell polarity as a boundary between the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. AJs are the main adhesive junctions involved in the mechanical strength of tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that these complexes not only mediate cell-cell adhesion, but are also engaged in signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. E-cadherin, the main protein of AJs interacts with the cytoskeleton via association with cytoplasmic proteins, the &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2; &#x02013; and p120-catenins. Whereas &#x003b2;-catenin associated with E-cadherin at the plasma membrane regulates cell-cell adhesion, cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin is involved in signal transduction and activation of genes, which play important roles in the development and progression of colorectal carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The role of TJ proteins is less understood in this context. A number of integral membrane proteins associated with TJs have been identified during recent years. These include occludin, junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) and the claudin family consisting of at least 24 members. PDZ proteins of the MAGUK family are other integrant proteins of TJs, which are localized at the membrane-cytoskeleton interfaces of cell-cell contacts. They include the zonula occludens proteins ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3, which are potentially involved in cell signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The role of ZO-1 protein is related to the interaction with the transcriptional factor ZONAB, known to regulate many events such as growth and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Prostaglandins (PGs) are bioactive lipid molecules produced by the cyclooxygenase enzymes COX-1 and COX-2, and exert diverse physiological actions in the gastrointestinal tract including maintenance of mucosal integrity, regulation of secretion and cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Clinical and experimental data indicate that prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) plays a predominant role in promoting cancer progression. It was reported that PGE<sub>2 </sub>stimulates EP receptor signaling with subsequent enhancement of cellular proliferation, promotion of angiogenesis, inhibition of apoptosis, stimulation of invasion/motility of colon cancer cells, as well as tumorigenic potential in intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It has been reported that both COX-2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are activated in most human cancers. The observation that forced expression of COX-2 in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells stimulates proliferation through EGFR activation, suggests the likelihood of a cross talk between these two pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In a previous study we have demonstrated a link between the PKC, EGFR and MAPK pathways to modulate the loss of E-cadherin dependent cell-cell adhesion in Caco-2 cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>PGE<sub>2 </sub>has also been implicated in direct EGFR activation through intracellular phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinase or extracellular release of a membrane-bound EGFR ligand, such as heparin-binding EGF in human colorectal cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, the involvement of EP receptor subtypes in these studies has been not reported. Furthermore, it was shown in LS174T, a human colorectal cancer cell line, that PGE<sub>2 </sub>induces expression of amphiregulin, an EGFR ligand, through a Protein Kinase A (PKA)-dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although it is known that PGE<sub>2 </sub>is the ligand to four EP receptors subtypes called EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4, which are the products of separate genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the lack of information concerning the role that each EP receptor plays hinders the understanding of PGE<sub>2</sub>-mediated gastrointestinal physiology alterations. Moreover, the precise role of each EP in the malignant behavior remains to be defined. Some studies have reported the participation of the EP1 and EP4 receptor in promoting tumorigenic behavior in colon carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and downregulation of subtype EP3 during colon cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, the identification of EP modulating epithelial barrier function through mediation of AJC disassembly events has not been reported.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the response of Caco-2 cells to treatment with PGE<sub>2</sub>. We hypothesized that PGE2 would impair the AJC assembly and function of Caco-2 cells. We examined AJC protein distribution, paracellular permeability and identified the involvement of EP receptors as well as cell signaling pathways in response to prostanoid treatment. We report in this study that treatment with PGE<sub>2 </sub>caused a transient AJC disassembly through a network involving EP1 and EP2 receptors and PKC signaling with claudin-1 as target related to TJs effects in the human colon cancer cells, Caco-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Prostaglandin E2 treatment causes a differential redistribution of the AJC proteins</title><p>Initially, we analyzed the distribution of the AJC proteins after treatment with PGE<sub>2 </sub>by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against E-cadherin, &#x003b2;-catenin, claudin-1, occludin and ZO-1.

After 15 min of treatment E-cadherin appears in a discontinuous and irregular string-of beads-shape at the cell-cell contacts. At 30 min internalization into the cytoplasm was observed but at 60 min there was a significant recovery of the labeling pattern. &#x003b2;-catenin at 15 min also showed a discontinuous and irregular labeling at the membrane with projections to the cytoplasm; at 30 min and 60 min of treatment it appears with minor translocation into the cytoplasm, however a considerable amount of the protein was still at the membrane. Immunostaining of claudin-1 at 15 min showed a discontinuous membranous staining in same regions of cell-cell contact and at 30 min this effect was more evident with strong points of labeling and a weak or absent staining in the cell-cell contact area. At 60 min there was a labeling recovery at the cell-cell contacts. Occludin appears with no alterations at 15 min, however after 30 and 60 min of treatment projections in the direction of the cytoplasm mainly at 60 min, were observed.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Prostaglandin E2 treatment causes a differential redistribution of the AJC proteins</bold>.

When cells were pretreated with SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, it was possible to observe that the inhibitor did not prevent the drop of the PGE<sub>2</sub>- induced TER. Incubation of Caco-2 cells with H-89, a PKA blocker, did not prevent the TER decrease after 15 and 30 min of PGE<sub>2 </sub>treatment, but abolished the gradual TER re-stabilization promoted after 60 and 120 min. It is important to point out that, although the IC<sub>50 </sub>of H-89 for PKA is 48 or 135 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], we used the concentration of 20 &#x003bc;M on the basis of previous studies showing that it is also able to inhibit PKA activity in culture cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

Similarly, TJ proteins claudin-1 and occludin showed an apparent redistribution from cell-cell contacts to the cytoplasm; however ZO-1 remained unaltered. By immunoblotting it was possible to observe a significant increase in the soluble TX-100 fraction of &#x003b2;-catenin, E-cadherin and claudin-1, but not for occludin. Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis of the subapical AJC region revealed wide spaces in this area in response to PGE<sub>2</sub>, but the TJ regions apparently remained unaltered. Concomitantly to these results, we showed a significant decrease of the TER, as well as increased permeation to ruthenium red marker in cells treated with PGE<sub>2</sub>. Since TJs are largely responsible for regulating paracellular permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] it is probably that PGE<sub>2 </sub>acts directly against the components of these structures. The distribution analysis of claudin-1 tends to support this conclusion, since the translocation of this protein from the TX-100 insoluble fraction (cytoskeleton-linked proteins) to the TX-100 soluble fraction (cytoplasmic proteins) is associated with the drop of the TER and permeation to ruthenium red in response to PGE<sub>2</sub>. Several groups have described the involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF&#x003b1; and interferon-&#x003b3;, on AJC proteins and barrier function modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In relation to PGE<sub>2</sub>, only one study carried out by Martin-Venegas et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] reported increased paracellular permeability when differentiated Caco-2 cells were stimulated with PGE<sub>2</sub>. Nevertheless, in this study the AJC protein distribution was not carried out, different PGE<sub>2 </sub>concentrations were used and paracellular permeability alteration was only evidenced after 2 h of treatment. In our work here we also reported altered cytoskeleton-linked claudin-1, as evidenced by their translocation to TX-100 soluble fraction in PGE<sub>2</sub>-treated cells, corroborating with the paracellular permeability alteration. This result is consistent with studies showing that alterations in distribution or expression of claudin-1 play an important role in epithelial barrier function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Adaptor ZO proteins have been documented as being responsible for the connection between claudins and the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The fact that we did not find distribution differences of ZO-1 in PGE<sub>2- </sub>treated cells, suggests that other adaptor proteins, not investigated here, could be mediating this linkage.</p><p>Prostanoids such as PGE<sub>2 </sub>exert their biological action through binding to four specific membrane receptors &#x02013; the subtypes EP1 to EP4 that are G protein-coupled receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The expression and involvement of these receptors in colorectal cancer has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; however it is not known whether these receptors are involved in the regulation of the AJC disassembly and consequently contribute to carcinogenesis colorectal. Here, we showed the involvement of PGE<sub>2 </sub>receptor subtypes EP1 and EP2 in mediating AJC disassembly. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that 17-phenyl trinor PGE<sub>2</sub>, butaprost, and sulprostone caused a significant decrease in the TER at 15 and 30 min in a similar manner to PGE<sub>2 </sub>and its analogue. It has been reported that both, sulprostone and 17-phenyl trinor PGE<sub>2 </sub>are EP1 and EP3 receptor agonists, however in the concentration of 1 &#x003bc;M used in the present study, they have a higher affinity for the EP1 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Since previous results show that Caco-2 cells express only EP1 and EP2 subtypes of PGE<sub>2 </sub>receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], we suggest that PGE<sub>2 </sub>mediates AJC disassembly through EP1 and EP2 receptors in this cell line.</p><p>It is known that EP2 receptors are coupled to PKA/adenyl cyclase and mediate the increase of intracellular cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] whereas ligand binding of EP1 is associated with phospholipase C and PKC activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. On the other hand, studies have demonstrated the involvement of various cell signaling pathways such as: PKC, PKA, MAPK, and PI3K/Akt in the regulation of the TJ barrier function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In our PGE<sub>2 </sub>stimulation model using Caco-2 cells, we found that PGE<sub>2</sub>-EP1 and -EP2 receptor signaling to decrease TER was predominantly linked to the PKC pathway, but not to PKA or p38MAPK. It is known that PKC has long been recognized to affect epithelial and endothelial barriers. This kinase consists of a family of Ser/Thr-specific kinases, which includes 12 known isozymes that can be classified into three subfamilies: conventional (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b3;), novel (&#x003b4;, &#x003b5;, &#x003b8;, &#x003b5; and &#x003bc;) and atypical (&#x003bb;, &#x003c4; and &#x003b6;), which differ in their mechanism of action, subcellular distribution, substrate type and expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition, several studies using different agents that perturb the epithelial junctional complex have demonstrated the involvement of various kinases in the phosphorylation and regulation of claudin proteins, however the mechanisms underlying this effect remain largely unknown. In relation to PKC, a recent study using three complementary molecular approaches and Caco-2 cells showed that the PKC-&#x003b8; isoform plays various novel mechanisms in intestinal epithelium, namely: alterations of the claudin-1 and claudin-4 isotypes phosphorylation, membrane assembly, and distribution as well as permeability function in cell monolayer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. If this PKC isoform is responsible to mediate alteration in claudin-1 in Caco-2 cells treated with PGE2, remain to be elucidated. It is an important addition to studies on cell signaling mechanisms involving EP receptors in colorectal cancer that are usually aimed at analysing proliferation or apoptosis events, but not epithelial cell barrier function. For instance, it was reported that in an EP4 receptor expression model with HEK293 cells, cAMP signalling appears to play a minor role in proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. By contrast, cAMP-dependent suppression of apoptosis by PGE<sub>2 </sub>seems to occur by a mechanism dependent on ERK and p38MAPK signaling, but not PKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Also, PGE<sub>2</sub>-dependent EGFR activation in human colorectal cancer cells appears to be variable, with responsive (LS-174) and unresponsive (DLD-1) cell lines described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Recently, using a model of EP4 receptor overexpression in HT-29 cells, it was shown that PGE<sub>2</sub>-EP4 receptor signaling was linked predominantly to cAMP signaling and in low level to ERK activation, but not PKB/AKT signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. There is a clear significant heterogeneity of signaling pathways mediating PGE<sub>2 </sub>activities in different colorectal cells and the interplay between EP receptor subtypes, which are variably present on different colorectal cancer cell lines, may explain this event. Interestingly, we did not find PKA involvement in TER decrease, however it is recognized that cAMP can also signal in a PKA-independent manner via the cAMP-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac1, which in turn activates Ras-GTPase Rap1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Additional studies are needed to elucidate if Epac 1 is involved in EP1 and EP2 receptor signaling pathways mediated by PGE<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, the fact that H-89 did prevented TER recovery after 60 and 120 min of treatment with PGE<sub>2</sub>, suggests that PKA activation is necessary for AJC restoration, which is consistent with data showing that PKA is related to positive regulation of cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we have shown that PGE<sub>2 </sub>can affect AJC architecture and function and that at least part of this effect is mediated through PKC activation in an event that requires the participation of EP1 and EP2 receptors and claudin-1 as an important target of PKC for the TJ-related effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study we analyzed cell signaling mechanisms underlying PGE<sub>2 </sub>treatment on the Apical Junctional Complex assembly and function in a human colon cancer cell model. Using a physiologically relevant prostanoid dose it was possible to observe that AJC proteins are differentially redistributed and this effect was concomitant to an impairment of the paracellular permeability in Caco-2 cells. We demonstrated for the first time that PGE<sub>2</sub>-EP1 and EP2 receptor signaling regulates AJC disassembly through a mechanism that involves PKC, but not PKA or p38MAPK and reveals a critical role of claudin-1 in this event. Examination of these pathways can give a better understanding of the mechanisms concerning the loss of cell-cell adhesion and colon cancer progression and suggest new directions for potential therapy for this disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Rabbit polyclonal anti-claudin-1 (JAY.8), occludin and ZO-1 (Z-R1) antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories, Inc.
