INTRODUCTION</title><p>The scientificcommunity has just begun to appreciate the number and complexity of organismsinhabiting the human body. The human microbiota contains 10 times as many cellsas the human body and incorporates bacteria, viruses, archea, protozoans, andfungi. Many essential body processes require the presence of these diversemicroorganisms to maintain pH in the oral and vaginal cavities, prevent invasionby pathogenic organisms, stimulate the immune system, aid digestion, and providenutrients essential to our health. If a diverse microbiota is essential forhuman functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], disruption of the normalmicrobiota should have significant negative consequences for human health. Indeed, studies suggest that the gut microbiota can influence risk of obesity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and allergiesand asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The National Institutesof Health recently launched a series of initiatives focused on characterizing thehuman microbiome, the collective genomes of the microbial symbionts thatinhabit a human host. Characterizing the microbiome provides insight into thediversity of genomes inhabiting the human host and is a first step towardsunderstanding the complicated interactions among symbionts and between thesymbionts and the human host. This launch has stimulated much discussion on why and howthe human microbiome should be characterized. There has been little explicitdiscussion, however, of the underlying conceptualizations or models of the microbiotawhich might guide this characterization. Models provide a framework for designingexperiments and for making inferences and predictions. In this commentary, we describe the range of conceptualizationsof the human microbiota that have been implicit in different segments of thisemerging literature. By making explicit the underlying models, we reveal theunderlying assumptions and can consider the strengths and weaknesses of thedifferent models in fitting existing observations, identify important datagaps, make predictions, and consider what model best applies in a givensituation or for a given research or clinical question.</p><p>				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> graphicallydisplays the range of conceptualizations of the microbiota implicitly describedin the following literature.</p><p>				<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The microbiotaconsidered as a single unit that interacts with the host and the external environment;a multicelled organ.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The microbiotaconsisting of multiple taxa, but considered as a single unit in itsinteractions with the host.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The microbiotaas an assemblage of multiple taxa, which each can interact with the host andthe environment independently.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The microbiotaas a dynamic ecological community consisting of multiple taxa each potentially interactingwith each other, the host, and the environment.</p></list-item></list>Conceptualizations (1) and (4) are clearly extremes andmost research probably falls somewhere between them. However, because they areextremes, we can more clearly contrast them and their underlying assumptions,which have different implications for the development of clinical interventions(see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). We expect an understanding of the human microbiota to require amelding of conceptualizations and associated theories before the promise oftranslating this understanding to new prevention, diagnostic, and treatmentstrategies can be achieved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. THE MICROBIOTA AS A MULTICELLED ORGAN</title><p>The microbiota is implicitlyassumed to be much like a multicelled organ in much of the medical literature(<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]: like an organ, a healthy microbiota consumes, stores, andredistributes energy and mediates important chemical transformations that benefitthe host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Communication among the cells that make up the microbiota enablesreplication and repair, and a set of feedback loops link host and microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). The focus of an organ conceptualization is on <italic>function</italic>, with metabolic products and immune or neurologicalresponses depending on the microbiota as a whole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This view also implicitly assigns borders to the unit of interest, assumingthat each spatially defined set of microbiota&#x02014;the gut, oral community, or vaginal community&#x02014;exists as adistinct and independent entity, and that each entity interacts with the hostand the external environment as a single unit. Perhaps most importantly, thisconceptualization assumes that any variation in the microbiota over time andbetween individual hosts is not functionally important or can be overlooked becauseof redundancies in genetic elements encoding various metabolic pathways indifferent strains or species. These unstated assumptions, summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>, have the advantage of simplifying the system and focusing our attention onmeasuring inputs and outputs, physical structure, and defining spatialboundaries.</p><p>Conceptualizing the microbiotaas an organ suggests research should characterize the range of inputs andoutputs and immune response to the outputs and correlate them with healthy anddiseased states for development of diagnostics. This conceptualization alsoimplies that a therapeutic that adjusts the inputs and outputs could return theorgan to a healthy state or substitute for a poorly functioning organ. For example, early diabetes&#x02014;a malfunctioning pancreas&#x02014;is diagnosed by measuring organ inputs (glucose levels), and is treated by decreasing inputs (lowering glucose levels) orsupplying output (insulin). We might envision similar inputs and outputs thatcan be used to diagnose and correct disrupted microbiota in the skin, mouth,gut, or vaginal cavity.</p><p>Assuming a physicalstructure and boundaries stimulates studies to explore that structure anddefine boundaries. For example, conceptualizing the microbiota as an organ leads us to consider that the microbiota on the skin or intestinal lumen might form physical structures, such as biofilms. This structure might vary in size and composition, being a thick lawn in someareas and thin islands in others and act as an additional physical barrier tocolonization by pathogens. Disrupting theseprotective biofilms chemically or physically may lead to invasion bypathogens. Additionally, the size ordenseness of the structure might in some surfaces be associated with disease. Assuminga defined boundary suggests that microbiota might be moved or be removed, andthat there are optimal areas for measuring inputs and outputs. These are alltestable hypotheses. The disadvantage ofconceptualizing the microbiotaas an organ is that it necessarily minimizes the complexity of a diversemicrobiota, which may lead us to either underestimate the possible unintendedconsequences or overestimate the potential of proposed interventions.</p><p>The current researchfocus on cataloging the diversity of microbiota using genomic techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] takes a step beyond viewing the microbiota as a single,homogeneous unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). While acritical next step, this approach goes nofurther than the basic organ-view in understanding the <italic>mechanisms</italic> that drive variation in function of the microbiota; theunderlying assumptions and implications of this approach remain quite similar tothose of the &#x0201c;microbiota as organ&#x0201d; conceptualization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec3"><title>3. MICROBIOTA AS AN ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY</title><p>The other extreme is to conceptualize the microbiota as a continuumof dynamic ecological communities living in the numerous microhabitats of thehuman body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Each species or strain of the microbiota interacts with othermembers of the microbiota and with the host, as well as with the externalenvironment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(d)</xref>). This conceptualization highlights interactionsbetween component organisms and their dynamics; a dynamic and spatiallycontinuous system is assumed, and the net effects can be positive, negative, orneutral towards the host (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Key tothis conceptualization is that understanding the underlying processes thatcontrol community structure, including the interactions among the microbiotathemselves, is essential for understanding its function. This conceptualizationhas the advantage of increased realism, but is much more complex andconsequently may be less useful for some purposes.</p><p>Considering microbiota as an ecological communitystimulates research into how that community reacts to insults. For example, anumber of conditions, such as reactive arthritis, occur in some individuals inresponse to infection. One current theory is that certain microbial surfaceantigens mimic host cell receptors, so individuals with a particular variant inimmune signals generate an immune response to their own cells after infectionhas cleared. The role of microbiota inmediating this response has not yet been considered. However, we know that the gutmicrobiota is important in modulating host immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It is possiblethat bacteria that lead to reactive arthritis disrupt the signals between thehuman body and the microbiota such that the immune system no longer seesorganisms with antigens similar to those of the host as self, leading to self-attack. Consequently, the reason that reactive arthritis is frequently self-limiting maybe related to restoration of the normal microbiota with subsequent restorationof immune signals.</p><p>While some research has conceptualized the human microbiotaas an ecological community, the interactions among microbiota remain almostcompletely unexplored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Most work is similar to the conceptualization in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>, characterized by independent relationships between each member ofthe microbiota and its human host, but not among the microbiota themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, wesuspect that interactions among members of a community, including the numerousindirect pathways of influence generated in such webs, are integral to understandingthe dynamic and spatially heterogeneous nature of many aspects of the humanmicrobiota and, therefore, to the functioning of those communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. If so,however, complex and difficult, research must address how this understanding ofecological dynamics and function can be translated to successful clinicalinterventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec4"><title>4. RESEARCH AND CLINICAL CONSEQUENCESOF ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OFTHE HUMAN MICROBIOTA</title><p>The underlying conceptualization of the microbiota guides,either explicitly or implicitly, medical approaches to treating and preventingconditions of disrupted flora. An organ view assumes that switching from anunhealthy (dysfunctional) to a healthy (functional) state can be achieved by manipulatinginputs or outputs. With this model in mind, the associated research agenda willfocus on characterizing the products of the microbiota, their healthy anddiseased ranges, and how the products are affected by host characteristics andthe external environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Therapeuticstudies will seek to shift metabolic products or cell signals back to the functionalstate associated with health.</p><p>By contrast, if we conceptualize the microbiota as multiplecommunities of interacting genomes, we might instead try to reestablish ormaintain a specific microbial community structure associated with health. Successof this approach depends on reestablishing a healthy microbial community, withall its associated feedbacks. The fact that we currently lack sufficientunderstanding to establish complex ecological communities with a fullcomplement of functioning interactions may account for disappointing andinconsistent results when probiotics have been used to treat vulvovaginal candidiasisand antibiotic-associated diarrheas: merely adding organisms to a complexsystem&#x02014;even in large amounts&#x02014;can be insufficient to lead to a healthycommunity structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec5"><title>5. INTEGRATING THE CONCEPTUALIZATIONS:FUTURE RESEARCH ON THE HUMAN MICROBIOTAAND HEALTH</title><p>The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) is a major roadmap initiativeof the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Each NIH institute has beenexploring various ways to meet the goals of the initiative, primarily from anorgan viewpoint, in keeping with the organization of the institutes by diseaseor organ system. As the HMP moves forward, it would benefit from the developmentof an overall conceptual framework for structuring the research agenda,analyzing the resulting data, and applying the results in order to improvehuman health. Given the complexity of interactions among organisms in the humanmicrobiota and the complexities and variations of human hosts and the organismsthat inhabit those hosts, a catalog of microbes even from a range of multiple,diverse, individuals is only a first step towards the ultimate goal ofmanipulating human microbiota to prevent and treat disease. Further progresswill require understanding the <italic>drivers</italic> of change in human microbiota that lead to disease states, particularly theunderlying mechanisms and functions of microbiota, and how to establish andmaintain communities consistent with health. Understanding the mechanisms andfunctions that process inputs and lead to outputs will enhance ourability to consistently manipulate the microbiota in the form of medicalinterventions and to minimize the unintended consequences of thoseinterventions.</p><p>The levelof complexity required to take a dynamic ecological view of human microbiota isdaunting and will require collaborations among many disciplines including molecularbiology, ecology, medicine, epidemiology, and mathematics. To fully understandthe mechanisms that drive community structure and function, microbiota must beexamined over time to determine the dynamics of its processes and over space todetermine the interconnectedness of microbiota within an individual host andthe range of microbiota among individuals. A comparison of microbiota amongindividuals living in countries with poorer sanitation to those with highlevels of sanitation might be particularly interesting, in that normal,healthy, microbiota from less developed areas may regularly includehelminthes. Moreover, these studies willrequire testing large numbers of diverse individuals, as the range of what is &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d;or &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; is probably very wide and may depend, in part, on the geneticmake-up of the host and the associated environment. In addition, experimentalapproaches will be essential to interpret descriptive studies. Experiments in well-controlled model systems suchas bioreactors or animal models will be useful to isolate subsets of theinteracting components depicted in the dynamic ecological community model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(d)</xref>). Such experiments will provide a critical bridge between descriptions ofhighly diverse communities that change over time and space on one hand and thelogistically intractable task of experimental investigation of all possibleinteraction pathways in such communities. Isolating key components ofcommunities for intensive study of interactions has been very successful inunderstanding the ecology of macrocommunities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Finally, mathematical models that requirespecification of the hypothesized underlying systems will enable conduct of simulationexperiments to understand direct and indirect effects. The validity ofsimulation experiments depends heavily on the data available to &#x0201c;dock&#x0201d; themodel. All of these approaches should lean heavily on well-developed ecologicaland evolutionary theories to form hypotheses and testable, quantifiablepredictions.</p><p>Neither of the two extreme conceptualizationsof the human microbiota, the multicelled organ and the ecological communitymodel, are likely to be the most useful; integrated conceptualizations may bemost appropriate for different research questions or clinical problems. Regardless of our conceptualization, however,we need to recognize that implicit assumptions yield different predictions on theimpact of microbiota function on human health and move the research agenda indifferent ways. As the biomedical community moves into this rapidly burgeoningarea, funds should be set aside to explore and develop theoreticalunderpinnings that draw on existing ecological and evolutionary theories and, thus, hasten efforts towards theultimate goal of maintaining a healthy microbiota to maintain human health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Theauthors would like to thank colleagues Daniel Clemans, John Erb-Downward, CarlF.
