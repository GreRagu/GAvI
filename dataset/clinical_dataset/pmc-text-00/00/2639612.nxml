Further, an inverse relationship exists between the age of first experience and the probability of adult abuse. Whether and how the combined effects of prenatal and adolescent ethanol experiences contribute to this progressive pattern remains unknown. Fetal ethanol exposure directly changes the odor attributes of ethanol important for both ethanol odor preference behavior and ethanol flavor perception. These effects persist only to adolescence. Here we tested whether adolescent ethanol odor re-exposure: (Experiment 1) augments the fetal effect on the adolescent behavioral response to ethanol odor; and/or (Experiment 2) perpetuates previously observed adolescent behavioral and neurophysiological responses into adulthood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Pregnant rats received either an ethanol or control liquid diet. Progeny (observers) experienced ethanol odor in adolescence via social interaction with a peer (demonstrators) that received an intragastric infusion of either 1.5 g/kg ethanol or water. Social interactions were scored for the frequency that observers followed their demonstrator. Whole-body plethysmography evaluated the unconditioned behavioral response of observers to ethanol odor in adolescence (P37) or adulthood (P90). The olfactory epithelium of adults was also examined for its neural response to five odorants, including ethanol.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Experiment 1: Relative to fetal or adolescent exposure alone, adolescent re-exposure enhanced the behavioral response to ethanol odor in P37 animals. Compared to animals with no ethanol experience, rats receiving a single experience (fetal or adolescent) show an enhanced, yet equivalent, ethanol odor response. Fetal ethanol experience also increased olfactory-guided following of an intoxicated peer. Experiment 2: Combined exposure yielded persistence of the behavioral effects only in adult females. We found no evidence for persistence of neurophysiological effects in either sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fetal ethanol exposure influences adolescent re-exposure, in part, by promoting interactions with intoxicated peers. Re-exposure subsequently enhances ethanol odor responsivity during a key developmental transition point for emergent abuse patterns. While persistence of behavioral effects occurred in females, the level of re-exposure necessary to uniformly yield persistence in both sexes remains unknown. Nonetheless, these results highlight an important relationship between fetal and adolescent experiences that appears essential to the progressive pattern of developing ethanol abuse.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Clinical and epidemiological studies have demonstrated a strong predictive relationship between fetal ethanol exposure and the risk for abuse in adolescence and early adulthood. Fetal exposure is, perhaps, the best predictor of ethanol abuse in this "at risk" age group, surpassing even family history of alcohol related problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. There is also an inverse correlation between the age of first experience and the likelihood of continued abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Little is known, however, of the underlying biological factors contributing to the progressive pattern.</p><p>Much is known regarding what the human and animal fetus can learn behaviorally about chemosensory stimuli, including ethanol, as a consequence of fetal exposure. Indeed, such learning may be a fundamental feature of all mammalian species because it is important (from a survival standpoint) for the pre-weanling animal to accept and be attracted to the food sources consumed by the mother [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In humans there is evidence from infant testing that the fetus has the ability to detect and learn odor information via the mother's diet [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]]. Thus, the gaining of odor and flavor information by the human fetus is likely to affect the responsiveness to the sensory qualities of a fetal exposure stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], such as ethanol. Indeed, studies focusing on the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on later responsiveness to and acceptance of the drug have demonstrated that the fetus can acquire a memory for ethanol's chemosensory attributes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>One contributing mechanism to the above, fetal ethanol experience has been shown to tune the olfactory systems response specifically to ethanol odor. Rats exposed to ethanol throughout gestation display an enhanced neural and behavioral response to ethanol odor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. More importantly, Youngentob and Glendinning [submitted] have recently shown that the alterations in the behavioral response to ethanol odor modify the odor attributes of ethanol that are key to both a preference for its odor and flavor perception. That is, the effect of prenatal exposure on the response to ethanol odor not only significantly predicts the observed prenatal effect on enhanced ethanol intake but, more importantly, a significant proportion of the enhanced ethanol intake effect can be <italic>directly </italic>attributed to the enhanced behavioral response to ethanol odor.</p><p>Interestingly, these consequences although absent in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] persist into adolescence. That is, fetal exposure both enhances the adolescent functional response to ethanol odor consistent with that observed in infant animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and enhances ethanol intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Taken together, these observations suggest that adolescence is a key developmental transition point for perpetuating the effects of fetal ethanol exposure on odor-induced plasticity and its contribution to later acceptance patterns of the drug.</p><p>The present study, therefore, focused on an examination of the consequence of fetal ethanol exposure and brief adolescent odor re-exposure with respect to two questions. In Experiment 1, we tested the hypothesis that relative to fetal ethanol exposure alone, adolescent re-exposure will augment the behavioral response to ethanol odor in animals tested in adolescence. Experiment 2 tested the hypothesis that combined fetal and adolescent exposure will yield persistence of the known infant and adolescent behavioral and neurophysiological into adulthood.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>General note</title><p>A total of 288 experimental rats were utilized in these studies. Animals were housed at SUNY Upstate Medical University in a temperature and humidity controlled environment on a fixed 12 hour light-dark cycle. All treatments and testing were completed in accordance with the guidelines set by the SUNY Upstate Medical University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment of pregnant dams</title><p>For both experiments, Long-Evans female rats (Harlan-Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were weighed and placed into weight-matched groups of three dams each (<italic>a block for analytic purposes</italic>) on gestational (G) day 5. A total of six triads were used for each experiment. Within each triad, dams were randomly assigned to one of the three maternal treatments: an experimental dam (ET) fed ethanol in a liquid diet, a pair-fed (PF) dam or a free-choice dam (FC).</p><p>For the ET treatment group, ethanol was administered through an <italic>ad-libitum </italic>liquid diet (L10251, Research Diets, NJ) supplemented with increasing levels of ethanol (2.2% v/v G6&#x02013;G8, 4.5% v/v G9&#x02013;G10, 6.7% v/v) [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]]. The 6.7% diet provided the dams with 35% of their daily calories coming from ethanol, emulating a moderate ethanol intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Peak blood alcohol levels reach approximately 150 mg/dl on the evening of G17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Increasing the ethanol levels over time served to wean animals onto the diet such that we achieved the highest level of dietary exposure just before the time that olfactory neurons in rat fetuses (G14) begin to transduce sensory information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and before these neurons make synaptic connections with the olfactory bulb (G14&#x02013;15) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Both the PF and FC control groups were fed an iso-nutritive liquid diet with maltose/dextrin substituted for the calories derived by ethanol (L10252, Research Diets, NJ). The PF dams were restricted to the caloric intake of their respective weight-matched ethanol dam within each block to control for potential nutritional deficits that might arise due to the ET dam voluntarily consuming less diet. The PF dams had access to the same volume of liquid diet that the respective ET dams consumed on the previous day. FC dams had <italic>ad-libitum </italic>access to liquid diet and water throughout gestation.</p><p>Within 24 hours of birth, litters from the three maternal treatment groups were fostered to surrogate dams that received <italic>ad-libitum </italic>access to food and water throughout gestation. Litters were sexed and culled to 10 pups on the morning of postnatal day (P) 2 with the restriction that litters contained no fewer than 4 pups of either sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Re-exposure of adolescent animals</title><p>Adolescent re-exposure was accomplished using a social transmission of food odor preference paradigm. This method was chosen based on its requisite ability to transmit dietary information via the olfactory system. It is important to note that smelling a food on the breath of a conspecific leads to much stronger alterations in later responsiveness to a food source than mere familiarity with the substance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>At weaning (P21), eight pups (4 male; 4 female) from each maternal treatment were separated and randomly allocated into cages of 2 same sex siblings that remained together for the entirety of the experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). One pair from each ET, PF and FC litter was allocated to either the water experience or ethanol experience groups. Within each cage of siblings, one animal was further randomly selected as the demonstrator and the other the observer. As such, an animal within a pair could be a demonstrator for either ethanol or water and likewise the observer could experience the same. Thus, with this exposure design we were able to produce the appropriate groups of animals necessary to test specific hypotheses related to pre- and postnatal exposure.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Allocation of animals for the adolescent social transmission paradigm</bold>.

See text for details.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1744-9081-5-3-1"/></fig><p>Adolescent experience, with either ethanol or water, began on P29 and occurred 4 times, 48 hours apart (on P29, P31, P33, &#x00026; P35). On each exposure day the pairs were separated for 1 hr prior to social interaction (SI) (i.e., the observer remained in the home cage and demonstrator was removed). Thirty minutes into the separation, the demonstrator was intragastrically (i.g.) infused with either a subnarcoleptic dose of 1.5 g/kg ethanol (ethanol demonstrator) (a dose that has been found to increase odor preference and consumption of ethanol by na&#x000ef;ve adolescent observers) or the equivalent volume of tap water (water demonstrator) [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]]. Infusion was accomplished using a polyethylene cannula (PE-10) attached to a 5 cc syringe. While holding the animal by the scruff of the neck, the free end of the cannula was inserted through the oral cavity and into the stomach. The entire process took approximately 20 seconds per animal and has been shown to yield minimal evidence of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thirty minutes after the infusion, the demonstrator was returned to its home cage for 30 minutes of social interaction with the observer. Following the interaction, animals were separated for 4 hours. This period of separation ensured ethanol had cleared the ethanol demonstrator's system prior to being returned to the home cage with the observer sibling for overnight housing.</p></sec><sec><title>Recording of social interaction behavior</title><p>The first 30-min social interaction period was digitally taped using an iSight webcam (Apple Computers Inc., Cupertino, CA) and Security Spy software (Ben Software, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bensoftware.com"/>). An iMac computer (Apple Computers Inc., Cupertino, CA) operated the Security Spy Program and recorded images simultaneously from each of two iSight webcams at 30 frames/sec. Each camera recorded two cages of social interactions concurrently. Therefore, all four social interactions from one maternal treatment group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) were completed in the single 30-minute period. Upon completion of recording, the videos were transferred onto an external hard-drive for storage and later analysis.</p><p>For each pair of adolescent animals, only the first 10 minutes of the 30-min social interaction was viewed for scoring purposes (animals had a tendency to fall asleep after 10 min.). Regarding social interaction behaviors, previous studies have measured the occurrence of several forms of activity such as rearing, self-grooming, following, sniffing, crawling under/over, social grooming, nape attacks, pinning, and cuddling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, the specific focus of the present study was on the olfactory response to ethanol odor. Therefore, we directed our evaluation to the chemosensory-guided behavior of "following". In this respect, we suggest that the easily observable behavior of "following" is driven by exploratory sniffing, which, in and of itself, cannot be quantified with video. In other words, following behavior occurs, at least in part, due to interest in an odor, which is initiated through active exploratory sniffing. More importantly, examination of our following behavior demonstrated a proportional relationship with the amount of time spent in mouth-to-mouth contact, a measure that has been previously shown to facilitate social transmission of food information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, the number of times an observer followed their respective demonstrator peer was manually recorded for the first 10 minutes of each pairs' first social interaction session.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of reflexive sniffing behavior</title><p>The focus of our behavioral analysis was directed toward examining the unconditioned reflexive sniffing response to ethanol odor as a consequence of fetal and/or adolescent ethanol exposure. Alterations in stimulus-induced sniffing in response to ethanol odor were monitored using whole-body plethysmography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Briefly, the testing chamber (and matching reference chamber) consisted of a 1.3 L Plexiglas cylinder that permitted rapid odorant delivery and clean out. A computer controlled stimulus generation and presentation, as well as data collection. Stimuli were generated using standard flow-dilution olfactometry.</p><p>Each adolescent (P37) or adult (P90) observer animal was tested once. A testing session began with 40 air-only trials as a habituation period. Following habituation, air and ethanol odor trials were presented using a fixed 6s inter-trial interval schedule. Stimuli were presented randomly in blocks of 10 air and 10 odor stimuli. Five different concentrations of ethanol odor (0.313%, 0.625%, 1.25%, 2.5% and 5% of vapor saturation at 20&#x000b0;C) were presented as odor stimuli. Each stimulus concentration was presented for one complete block of trials and odorant concentration between blocks was incremented in an ascending order.</p></sec><sec><title>Behavioral response index</title><p>Previously it has been demonstrated that: (1) the profile of air movement (i.e., sniffing) is a complex response pattern that varies with odorant stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]: and (2) more importantly, although sniffing patterns can be deconstructed into a large number of descriptive variables (e.g., sniff volume, flow-rate and number), knowledge about any single variable is insufficient to evaluate the meaning of the behavioral response to odorant stimuli. By contrast, however, this complex pattern of behavior can be described and evaluated using a univariate measure that incorporates the derived variables along with their corresponding weightings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. To construct a "Composite Reflexive Sniffing Index" the odorant-induced sniffing response pattern for each stimulus presentation was first deconstructed into 14 response measures: sniff frequency; the number of inspiratory and expiratory sniffs; the duration, volume, average flow rate, and peak flow rate of an inspiratory and expiratory sniff; the total inspiratory and expiratory volume; and the total apneic duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Next, principle components analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the 14 derived characteristics (i.e., dimensions) of each hypothesis specific data set to a fewer number of uncorrelated dimensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Recall that, each animal contributes a 14 &#x000d7; 5 data matrix to the overall data set; specifically, 14 variables at each of the 5 concentrations of ethanol. The PCA in conjunction with least square multiple regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] was used, in turn, to reduce each animal's 14 &#x000d7; 5 data matrix to a single response variable at each of five concentrations of ethanol (i.e., a 1 &#x000d7; 5 matrix) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Finally, to construct the relevant "Composite Reflexive Sniffing Index" for each animal that incorporated the behavioral response across all concentrations tested, we estimated the coefficient for each of the five stimulus response measures (i.e. five behavioral response measures from the PCA) in a regression model. The composite index value for an individual animal was the linear summation of the constant from the regression analysis plus the animal's respective PCA value at each concentration of odorant tested times its' respective estimated coefficient.</p></sec><sec><title>Optical recording of odorant-induced epithelial activity</title><p>Briefly, using optical recording methods and a voltage-sensitive dye (di-4-ANEPPS), we assessed the response of both the septum and turbinate olfactory epithelium (OE) to odorant stimulation [for technical details see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]]. Each tissue was imaged onto a 120 &#x000d7; 120 pixel array of a Dalsa 12-bit digital CCD Camera (Dalsa, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]]. To expose the OE for recording, the right nasal cavity of a decapitated rat was split to expose the septum and turbinates. Each piece of tissue was soaked in di-4-ANEPPS, rinsed with saline, and then placed in a clear top Delrin chamber. The chamber contained both stimulus input and output ports. The input port allowed odorant or air to be passed through the chamber and pulled across the OE from external naris to nasopharynx by a vacuum at 200 cc/min. A single concentration of 6 different odorants was presented individually at levels known to produce sizeable response patterns in the rat [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]]. The concentrations of the odorants were as follows: 0.8% amyl acetate, 0.8% propyl acetate, 4% heptanal, 33% ethanol, 30% carvone, and 45% ethylacetoacetate of vapor saturation at 23&#x000b0;C. Amyl acetate was presented at the beginning and end of each session, serving as a standard stimulus for correction of tissue responsiveness over time. The raw responses were corrected for baseline shifts due to photo bleaching as well as adjusted for the levels of background fluorescence.</p><p>For each stimulus presentation, we recorded the response of the OE in terms of 2 measures of response magnitude (average and peak response heights) and 3 temporal measures (latency: start, peak and end times) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For each tissue evaluated, the overall neural response of the OE was characterized by encapsulating the five response measures (i.e., response dimensions) into a smaller number of uncorrelated dimensions using a PCA. <italic>A priori </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the first factor of the PCA was used to represent a single measure of the animals' neural response to each specific test odorant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedure</title><p>In Experiment 1, we restricted our evaluation of adolescent odor re-exposure to only the adolescent behavioral response to ethanol odor. In this respect, we did not evaluate for an augmentation of a neurophysiologic effect since it is known that enhancement of odorant-induced mucosal activity requires more extensive stimulation over time than that used in the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Nonetheless, this did not obviate the possibility that the postnatal experience obtained through the social interaction procedure may serve to stabilize (i.e., perpetuate) the prenatal neurophysiologic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] into adulthood. Therefore, in Experiment 2 each adult animal was behaviorally tested and at the completion of testing, these same animals were killed and their mucosal response to odorant stimulation assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Analytic strategy</title><p>In this study, we were not interested in testing the reliability of observed overall differences related to exposure design main effects. Rather, based on previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], for both experiments we tested a set of <italic>a priori </italic>hypotheses (using appropriately adjusted error terms). In this respect, for each specific hypothesis there was a specifically relevant effect to be evaluated such that what was most relevant to test one hypothesis was not most relevant to test another.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Experiment 1: Adolescent behavioral assessment</title><sec><title>Reflexive sniffing response to ethanol odor</title><p>The goal of the experiment was to test the hypothesis that re-exposure to ethanol odor during adolescence further enhances the known adolescent behavioral response resulting from fetal experience with the drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. To test this precise question, we evaluated the consequence of adolescent ethanol odor re-exposure, relative to fetal ethanol exposure alone, on the behavioral response to ethanol odor. In each of the analyses below the creation of the Composite Reflexive Sniffing Indexes were each based on the finding that the second factor of the PCA analyses met our criterion for variable selection from the multiple regression analyses (<italic>F </italic>&#x02265; 2.0: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]).

The prior result not withstanding, two issues require consideration in order to fully interpret the meaning of the above result: (1) although unlikely, prenatal ethanol exposure may not have resulted in the presence of an altered olfactory response at our age of testing in the present study; and (2) although, on average, adolescent re-exposure appeared to alter the response of fetal experience alone, the combined effect of fetal and adolescent experience may be no different than the effect of adolescent experience alone.

To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the consequence of adolescent ethanol odor re-exposure relative to fetal exposure alone on the response of the OE to six odorants. As described in the Methods section, the epithelial response to an odorant has both temporal and magnitude components. Thus, the odorant response was characterized using two magnitude response measures and three temporal measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Using an identical procedure as with our behavioral data, PCA was used to encapsulate the five response measures into a fewer number of uncorrelated measures of the neural response for each odorant. Neither of the resultant factors from the PCA met our predictive error criterion for variable selection (F &#x02265; 2.0; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]) for either the septum or turbinate OE. As such, this finding indicates that adolescent ethanol re-exposure did not perpetuate the neural effects of fetal exposure observed in infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and adolescent animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] into adulthood.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Developmental changes in the brain add to the age-specific behavioral uniqueness of adolescence, including the inherent increased propensity to use drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Thus, within the context of the present study a key question is the connection between fetal ethanol exposure, chemosensory plasticity, and adolescence. From a teleological standpoint, it has been argued that animals benefit from chemosensory mechanisms that emphasize the animal's attention to stimuli that are "presumed" significant for survival and reproductive fitness (e.g., the odor/taste of foods eaten by their mother) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This may be particularly true for adolescent animals, which are in the process of separating from their mothers and learning which foods are "safe" to eat. Given that chemical stimuli in a mother's diet can contaminate the fetal environment and provide sensory stimulation [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]], it has been suggested that it is highly adaptive for developing embryos to tune their chemosensory systems to the molecules present in the amniotic fluid, and feed selectively on specific foods after weaning.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, an adaptive mechanism that should work to the advantage of the animal may within the context of fetal ethanol exposure work to its disadvantage. Youngentob and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] demonstrated that prenatal ethanol exposure results in an alteration in olfactory system function that is manifested both behaviorally and neurophysiologically in the P15 rat and that these effects, although persistent into adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], are absent in adults (P90). Notably, fetal exposure results in enhanced ethanol intake in P15 rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] that is causally related to both the altered response to ethanol odor as well as altered gustatory perception [Youngentob and Glendinning, submitted]. These effects are also absent in adult littermates. The ages at which these studies observed a consequence of fetal exposure are in keeping with earlier literature on early postnatal [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]] and adolescent ethanol intake effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and at least one adult study that used a similar gestational exposure model and studied ethanol intake at similar early and late developmental ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Thus, the available data point to adolescence as a potentially critical transition point for perpetuating the olfactory experience-induced effects of fetal ethanol exposure into adulthood. Such a proposition is clinically relevant since, as previously noted, adolescence is a key transition point for emergent patterns of ethanol abuse and especially so following prior fetal exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Social interaction has been shown to play an important role in adolescent decision-making and is highly correlated with ethanol use in adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the present study, we utilized a well-established social transmission of food odor preference paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] to provide a second ethanol odor experience during adolescence. This paradigm centers on the finding that rodents obtain information regarding foods to ingest based, at least in part, on an interaction with a known peer that has recently ingested a "novel" diet. In other words, olfactory cues perceived on the breath of another animal (i.e., the demonstrator in our study) are known to impact later food choices of a conspecific (i.e., the observer). Importantly, several studies have demonstrated that both na&#x000ef;ve infant and adolescent observer animals will increase their ethanol intake as a consequence of interaction with a peer that was administered ethanol [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]]. Thus, this procedure permitted us to assess a second chemosensory-related ethanol experience through a potentially relevant form of human adolescent behavior, namely, social interaction with an exposed (i.e., intoxicated) peer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The results of our study significantly extend upon the prior work investigating experience-induced olfactory plasticity in response to fetal ethanol exposure [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], Youngentob and Glendinning, submitted]. Behavioral testing in late adolescence demonstrated that: (1) adolescent re-exposure to ethanol odor augments the known olfactory response resulting from fetal experience with the drug; (2) when tested in adolescence, the consequence of adolescent ethanol odor exposure in control animals results in an enhanced olfactory response to ethanol odor similar to those resulting from fetal exposure alone; and (3) those animals receiving combined fetal and adolescent experience with ethanol odor demonstrate an augmented behavioral response to ethanol odor relative to those animals with either one developmental experience (i.e., fetal or adolescent) or no experience with ethanol. Taken together, the results clearly demonstrate a cumulative consequence of the number of developmental time points during which ethanol experience occurs on the response of adolescent animals to ethanol odor.</p><p>Testing in adulthood revealed alterations in the behavioral response to ethanol odor only in females having experienced the combination of fetal and adolescent ethanol exposures. No behavioral effects were found in the adult males as a consequence of previous exposures to ethanol odor. Based on our adolescent results illustrating no differential effect of sex on the behavioral response to ethanol, we did not anticipate sex differences to be present in adulthood. Nonetheless, our findings are not overly surprising given the variable evidence in the literature regarding the differential effects of sex on the responsivity to a substance following exposure in a social situation. While several studies do not report an effect of sex when examining both male and female observers [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]], others strongly suggest sex may play a critical role in the effects of social interaction. Alterations in voluntary ethanol intake due to familiarity with the demonstrator appear to be sex dependant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], as do changes in food preference following administration of a benzodiazepine anxiolytic to reduce social aggression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Areas of social interaction behavior such as play fighting, which were not analyzed in the context of this experiment, have also illustrated sex differences, with males showing increased play fighting in adolescence as compared to females of the same age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] While the present study consisted of familiar, same sex littermates, it is not unrealistic to consider that the information received by the observers, through the social transmission of food preference design, could have been altered in a sex dependent manner due to age related changes in social behavior.</p><p>Sex dependant alterations in the demonstrators' level of ethanol intoxication could also have contributed to the differential adult effect as well. Although all demonstrators were infused with the same dose of ethanol, recent work in a collaborating lab reveals that adolescent female Long-Evans rats produce a much higher blood alcohol level (BAL) than males after ingesting the same dose of ethanol (F.A. Middleton, personal communication, September 13, 2008). Thus, a higher BAL in the female animals may have resulted in a different level of ethanol odor on the breath of females relative to males. This, in turn, would impact the transmission of the food preference leading to persistence of the behavioral effects into adulthood in the females.</p><p>Although the enhanced behavioral response to ethanol odor remains present in adult females, we did not find a persistence of the fetal ethanol induced alterations in the response of the OE for either sex. In considering this finding several issues need to be considered. First, new neurons are continuously integrated into the functional network of the olfactory system (both olfactory sensory [OSN] and olfactory bulb neurons) throughout development and even in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Indeed, expansion of the OE occurs continuously between adolescence and adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that as this normal expansion occurs the alteration in the response of the OE to ethanol odor, as a consequence of fetal exposure, became diluted (in short, a potential signal to noise problem) since it is unlikely that the initial fetal exposure effect modified the OE's progenitor cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Second, our adolescent ethanol exposures were relatively brief (30 minutes), occurring only 4 times, with non-exposure days interposed. As such, based on previous work demonstrating the need for extensive long-term odor exposure to yield an observable effect on the response of the OE [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]] it is not surprising, in retrospect, that our procedure did not yield additional detectable changes in the OE response.</p><p>It is also possible that the alterations in the response of the OE, while causally important in the initial priming of the enhanced behavioral odor effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], is not required for behavioral persistence into adulthood. That is, the early tuning of the OE to ethanol odor may reflect a global plasticity response of the olfactory system to ethanol odor that results in effects on more centrally olfactory structures that can be stabilized by adolescent odorant exposure. For example, it has been suggested that neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb plays a key role in information processing and memory storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. With this in mind, we hypothesize that a memory for ethanol has been formed by the alterations in the olfactory system due to prenatal ethanol odor exposure, and that this memory is reinforced by the adolescent ethanol exposure, leading to behavioral manifestations in the adult female.</p><p>Finally, with regard to our evaluation of the social interactions, we found that adolescent animals exposed to ethanol prenatally follow an intoxicated peer more frequently than control animals and that this increased behavior was specific to the peers that had ingested ethanol. This subsidiary finding further highlights the experience-induced consequences of fetal ethanol exposure on olfactory-mediated behaviors. Moreover, they suggest that within the context of "at risk" adolescents, prior exposure to ethanol may, among other things, augment the consequences of ethanol related social interaction by increasing the propensity to engage such setting. As such prior fetal exposure may play a key role in the individual affecting its own level of "re-exposure".</p><p>In view of the forgoing results, it is important to consider their broader implications to the clinical progression of developing patterns of ethanol abuse. As we have noted, within the context of fetal ethanol exposure, the normal adaptive process of chemosensory plasticity may work to the disadvantage of the adolescent animal: enhancing the already age inherent probability of initial ethanol intake and continued choice behavior in adolescence. Consistent with the implications of our behavioral findings others have shown that the interaction of pre- and postnatal exposure can yield enhanced ethanol avidity relative to the effect of prenatal exposure alone [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]]. However, if this second experience does not occur, the available data demonstrate that the fetal effects on olfactory function and ethanol avidity will be absent in adults [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]]. Thus, the timing of re-exposure to ethanol appears critical for persistence of the initial fetal effects into adulthood. In keeping with this hypothesis, the human data show an inverse relationship between the age of first adolescent experience and long-term abuse. Mechanistically, our proposed scenario would result from the alternative maintenance or amelioration of ethanol-induced stimulus activity. Indeed, it is a well-studied observation in olfactory development and even adulthood that stimulus-activated neurons are stabilized and survive while inactive ones are compromised and eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Given that this type of highly relevant competition is widespread throughout the developing nervous system [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]] and adolescence is a dynamic developmental period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], adolescent re-exposure may be a key element in developing patterns of progressive ethanol abuse.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study adds to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the important relationship between the behavioral responsiveness to ethanol odor and experience-induced modulations in olfactory function in response to the drug. Further, this study highlights a key association between fetal and adolescent experience that appears critical to the progressive nature of developing patterns of continued ethanol abuse.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors were involved in the design of the study; AME and LMY executed the study; AME, PRS, and SLY participated in analysis and interpretation of the data; and AME and SLY prepared and edited the manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Supported by NIH-NIAAA Grant AA014871 (SLY)</p><p>The authors thank Dr. Elena I.
