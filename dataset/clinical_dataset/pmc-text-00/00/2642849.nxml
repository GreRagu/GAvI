It represents less than 1% of all malignancies in men and is responsible for 0,1% of male cancer deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It behaves similiar to female breast cancer in most cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In our clinic incidence ratio is 2, 9:100 which is more than literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Men have a higher rate of ER positivity, which accounts for good responses with hormonal agents as in our study. We used only tamoxifen in all ER positive, DCIS cases. We used tamoxifen combined with radiotherapy in ER positive, IDC cases. The prevalence of MBC increases with age, with a mean age of 60&#x02013;65 years at presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Risk factors include increasing age, radiation exposure, and factors related to abnormalities in estrogen and androgen balance, including testicular disease, infertility, obesity, and cirrhosis. Risk factors related to a genetic predisposition include Klinefelter's syndrome, family history, and <italic>BRCA </italic>gene mutations, particularly <italic>BRCA2 </italic>mutations. Gynecomastia is not a risk factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Male breast cancer patients have an incidence of prostate cancer higher than would be predicted in the general population; this risk factor has implications for prostate cancer screening. In a recent study of Lee UJ et all, 12 of 69(17%) patients with male breast cancer also had a diagnosis of prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In our study 3 of 20(15%) patients had breast cancer with prostate cancer.</p><p>Breast cancer occurred in two patients with immunosuppressive disorders in our series.</p><p>MBC is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, with a typical subareolar mass associated with axillary lymph nodes and pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The male breast contains only ductal tissue, hence, most MBCs are of the ductal type. Histologically, 90% of male breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas. Approximately 80% are ER positive, 75% are PR positive, and 35% overexpress HER-2/neu. The remaining 10% are DCIS. Given the absence of terminal lobules in the normal male breast, lobular carcinoma, both invasive and in situ, is rarely seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The most common surgical treatment is modified radical mastectomy with axillary node dissection. Adjuvant radiotherapy has an important role in reducing the risk of local recurrence in large tumors, lymph node and muscle involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Tamoxifen is the most widely used adjuvant therapy, because it improves survival. It may be associated with more limited side effects in men than in women, like decreased libido, weight gain, hot flushes, mood alterations, depression, insomnia and deep vein thrombosis. There is no evidence that chemotherapy improves long term survival. Chemoterapy may be useful in node positive and locally advanced disease. The use of adjuvant RT has not been conclusively proven to reduce local recurrence.</p><p>Prognostic factors in male breast cancer are the same as in female breast cancer and include nodal involvement, tumor size, histologic grade, and hormone receptor status. When matched for age and stage, survival is similar to that in women. Poor prognosis is attributed to old age, axillary lymph node metastases(&#x0003e;4) and negative hormone receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>We confirm, none of the authors listed in this manuscript have any financial or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SA, MCY and HK contributed writing the article and review of the literature as well as undertaking a comprehensive literature search; SA and IA contributed design and manuscript preparation; AK provided the histopathologycal information.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was performed in University Hospital of Baskent, Ankara, Turkey.
