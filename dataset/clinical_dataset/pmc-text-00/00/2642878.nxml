Phase I trials are unique because they generally provide the first evaluation of new drugs in humans. The conduct and dissemination of Phase I trials have not previously been empirically evaluated. Our objective was to describe the initiation, completion, and publication of Phase I trials in comparison with Phase II&#x02013;IV trials.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We reviewed a cohort of all protocols approved by a sample of ethics committees in France from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1994. The comparison of 140 Phase I trials with 304 Phase II&#x02013;IV trials, showed that Phase I studies were more likely to be initiated (133/140 &#x0005b;95&#x00025;&#x0005d; versus 269/304 &#x0005b;88&#x00025;&#x0005d;), more likely to be completed (127/133 &#x0005b;95&#x00025;&#x0005d; versus 218/269 &#x0005b;81&#x00025;&#x0005d;), and more likely to produce confirmatory results (71/83 &#x0005b;86&#x00025;&#x0005d; versus 125/175 &#x0005b;71&#x00025;&#x0005d;) than Phase II&#x02013;IV trials.

Because giving any new drug to people is potentially dangerous, drugs are first tested in a short &#x0201c;Phase I&#x0201d; trial in which a few people (usually healthy volunteers) are given doses of the drug likely to have a therapeutic effect. A Phase I trial evaluates the safety and tolerability of the drug and investigates how the human body handles the drug. It may also provide some information about the drug's efficacy that can guide the design of later trials. The next stage of clinical drug development is a Phase II trial in which the therapeutic efficacy of the drug is investigated by giving more patients and volunteers different doses of the drug. Finally, several large Phase III trials are undertaken to confirm the evidence collected in the Phase II trial about the drug's efficacy and safety. If the Phase III trials are successful, the drug will receive official marketing approval. In some cases, this approval requires Phase IV (postapproval) trials to be done to optimize the drug's use in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="sb3b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>In an ideal world, the results of all clinical trials on new drugs would be published in medical journals so that doctors and patients could make fully informed decisions about the treatments available to them. Unfortunately, this is not an ideal world and, for example, it is well known that the results of Phase III trials in which a new drug outperforms a standard treatment are more likely to be published than those in which the new drug performs badly or has unwanted side effects (an example of &#x0201c;publication bias&#x0201d;). But what about the results of Phase I trials? These need to be widely disseminated so that researchers can avoid unknowingly exposing people to potentially dangerous new drugs after similar drugs have caused adverse side effects. However, drug companies are often reluctant to disclose information on early phase trials. In this study, the researchers ask whether the dissemination of the results of Phase I trials is adequate.</p></sec><sec id="sb3c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers identified 667 drug trial protocols approved in 1994 by 25 French research ethics committees (independent panels of experts that ensure that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial participants are protected). In 2001, questionnaires were mailed to each trial's principal investigator asking whether the trial had been started and completed and whether its results had been published in a medical journal or otherwise disseminated (for example, by presentation at a scientific meeting). 140 questionnaires for Phase I trials and 304 for Phase II&#x02013;IV trials were returned and analyzed by the investigators. They found that Phase I trials were more likely to have been started and to have been completed than Phase II&#x02013;IV trials. The results of 86&#x00025; of the Phase I studies matched the researchers' expectations, but the study hypothesis was confirmed in only 71&#x00025; of the Phase II&#x02013;IV trials. Finally, the results of 17&#x00025; of the Phase I studies were published in scientific journals compared to 43&#x00025; of the Phase II&#x02013;IV studies. About half of the Phase I study results were not disseminated in any form.</p></sec><sec id="sb3d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings suggest that the fate of Phase I trials is different from that of other clinical trials and that there is inadequate dissemination of the results of these early trials. These findings may not be generalizable to other countries and may be affected by the poor questionnaire response rate. Nevertheless, they suggest that steps need to be taken to ensure that the results of Phase I studies are more widely disseminated. Recent calls by the World Health Organization and other bodies for mandatory preregistration in trial registries of all Phase I trials as well as all Phase II&#x02013;IV trials should improve the situation by providing basic information about Phase I trials whose results are not published in full elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="sb3e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000034">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000034</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Two recent research articles published in <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic>&#x02014;by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&#x00026;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050191">Ida Sim and colleagues (<italic>PLoS Med</italic> e191)</ext-link> and by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&#x00026;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050217">Lisa Bero and colleagues (<italic>PLoS Med</italic> e217)</ext-link>&#x02014;investigate publication bias in Phase III trials</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov Web site </ext-link>provides information about the US National Institutes of Health clinical trial registry, background information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/understand">clinical trials</ext-link>, and a fact sheet detailing the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/s801-fact-sheet.pdf">requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (the body that approves drugs in the USA) Amendments Act 2007 for trial registration</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The World Health Organization's <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/ictrp">International Clinical Trials Registry Platform</ext-link> is working toward setting international norms and standards for the reporting of clinical trials (in several languages)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Decullier E, Chan A-W, Chapuis F (2009) Inadequate dissemination of Phase I trials: A retrospective cohort study.

Previous studies have described the outcome of study protocols &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, but none has focused on Phase I trials across specialties, or compared them with other trial phases. One previous review evaluated the outcome of Phase I trials submitted to an annual oncology meeting and found that 67&#x00025; were subsequently published &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, but studies submitted to an annual meeting in one specialty field might be not representative of all Phase I studies. Our findings confirm the low overall publication rate of clinical trials found in previous reviews &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Methodological reviews of trials should therefore consider analyzing different phases as distinct subgroups.</p><p>The strength of our study was that we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the pharmaceutical trials approved in 1994 by half of the RECs in France. Approval by local RECs is mandatory for any research protocol involving interventions in human beings. Our sample is therefore representative of the pharmaceutical trials conducted in France.</p><p>Several limitations may have affected the results of our study. The overall response rate of 67&#x00025; is comparable to previous methodological surveys of trials &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. The differential response rate between Phase I and Phase II&#x02013;IV trials may have introduced response bias, although it is unclear whether this would have influenced our findings in any given direction. It is likely that the publication rates found in our study were overstated if we assume that nonresponders would be more likely to have trials that were not initiated, not completed, or unpublished. On the other hand, we did not confirm the publication status of trials on databases such as PubMed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; because the files were anonymous. This may have led to an underestimation of publication rates, although our findings were similar to previous reviews &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, we were unable to determine the publication date when the specific journal reference was not provided.</p><p>Some studies were excluded from the survival analysis due to missing data on dates of publication and dates of censoring, this analysis should therefore be interpreted with caution. We chose to exclude these published studies as the alternative, i.e., including them as censored at time 0, would mean ignoring the fact that they were published. The same also applies to the unpublished studies.</p><p>Another practical challenge in describing the methodological characteristics of our cohort was that detailed information was often missing from the protocols, such as the expected study duration. One of the reasons could be related to varying standards in the requirements for protocol content. We focused on the expected duration and sample size as information on the actual duration and sample size was less often available.</p><p>The methods and results of our cohort of protocols approved in 1994 are still relevant, since a median delay of 5 to 8 y is generally observed before publication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, the publication and prospective registration of Phase I trials is still subject to discussion in 2008. The poor dissemination of Phase I trials highlights the importance of their inclusion in the prospective registration of clinical trials &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Whilst several bodies, including the World Health Organization, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, and the Ottawa Group, have called for their registration in public registries &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, pharmaceutical companies have expressed their reluctance to disclose information on early phase trials &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Although the results of preliminary Phase I studies might be considered by some to be less clinically relevant, there are several ethical and scientific reasons for making this data publicly available. Firstly, if access to medical information is a moral right, then it should be provided irrespective of study funding and phase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. The testing of new pharmaceuticals on humans is approved by ethics committees based on the assumption that the inherent risks of trial participation are balanced by the benefit of new scientific knowledge for society. If this knowledge from Phase I remains hidden, then any potential risk incurred by trial participation is excessive and could endanger human lives &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Although Phase I trials are usually safe &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; with very few deaths and severe adverse events (incidence of related severe adverse events of 0.2&#x00025; over a 2-y period among 15,386 participants), adverse events from Phase I studies are known to be rarely published &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, which means that this knowledge is unavailable to other researchers who may unknowingly conduct harmful trials on similar interventions.</p><p>The danger of suppressed knowledge was particularly evident in the Phase I trial for TGN1412 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, where the serious adverse reactions suffered by six healthy volunteers in 2006 might have been avoided had the results of a previous unpublished trial of a similar antibody been known &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Since this event, reports have been published to highlight the need for improved sharing of knowledge from Phase I trials &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.

Furthermore, the willingness of journals to publish Phase I trial results, whether positive or negative, would help improve their unbiased dissemination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>It should also be noted that a third of research programs for investigational drugs are abandoned for primarily economic reasons rather than concerns over efficacy or safety &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000034-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;.
