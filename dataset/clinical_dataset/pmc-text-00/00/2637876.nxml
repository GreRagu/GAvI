Under physiological conditions, neural stem cells from the SVZ migrate to the olfactory bulb through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) and differentiate into granule and periglomerular neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Several studies have shown that stroke can induce neurogenesis in the adult SVZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Growth and neurotrophic factors, usually administered by the invasive intracerebral route, have been shown to enhance neurogenesis after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This suggests that they have the ability to modify endogenous neural stem cells and their potential for self-repair after ischemia.</p><p>Although neurotrophic factors contribute to adult neurogenesis, it is difficult for these large peptides (5&#x02013;30 kDa) to be transported across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) and intraparenchymal administration are not clinically practical because of the diffusion limitations, invasiveness, cost and safety concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Intranasal administration of growth factors provides an effective, non-invasive method for bypassing the BBB to deliver drugs to the brain along the olfactory and trigeminal neural pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. One recent study has demonstrated that intranasal fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) or heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) increase neurogenesis in the normal adult mouse brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], but the effect of intranasal neurotrophic factors on neurogenesis in animals after stroke has not been investigated.</p><p>Transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1) is a versatile cytokine capable of modulating multiple functions, such as cell growth and differentiation, inflammation and cell repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It also has been shown to protect neurons from various injuries, including hypoxia/ischemia, excitotoxic injury and neurotoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Even though endogenous TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression can be up-regulated following stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], ischemia-mediated elevation of TGF-&#x003b2;1 is insufficient and transient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Whether or not TGF-&#x003b2;1 plays a role in the regulation of neurogenesis after brain ischemic damage remains unknown. As a peptide with large molecular weight and short plasma half-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], exogenous TGF-&#x003b2;1 cannot cross the intact BBB and may cause organ fibrosis following intravenous injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

Our data showed that there is a significant reduction in infarct volume in mice treated with TGF-&#x003b2;1, which is consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. TUNEL labeling indicated that ischemia induced DNA degradation was also decreased after intranasal administration of TGF-&#x003b2;1. Simultaneously, TGF-&#x003b2;1-treated animals exhibited progressive improvement on the NSS test compared with controls. All these support the hypothesis of a neuroprotective role for intranasal TGF-&#x003b2;1 in stroke. In addition to its function as a neuroprotective agent, TGF-&#x003b2;1 is a key regulator in development and cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], suggesting that the functional recovery after stroke may be mediated by some other mechanisms. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the effect of intranasal TGF-&#x003b2;1 on neuroprotection and ischemia-induced neurogenesis in the SVZ was evaluated.</p><p>Adult neurogenesis consists of one or more of the following processes, including proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It is known that the number of BrdU immunoreactive cells in the SVZ increased with a peak at 7 days after ischemia, and then decreased gradually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The loss of BrdU-positive cells may be attributed to dilution of BrdU, apoptosis, and cell migration. In the present study, we demonstrated that intranasal treatment with TGF-&#x003b2;1 significantly increased BrdU-labeled cells both in the SVZ and striatum ipsilateral to the ischemia at each time point from 7 days after stroke. Despite the subsequent dilution of BrdU-labeling due to continued division or death of labeled cells, we also observed an increase in BrdU-positive cells at day 21 and day 28 after MCAO. Apart from enhancing survival of newborn cells, the increased number of BrdU-labeled cells in the injured striatum of TGF-&#x003b2;1-treated animals may result from an accelerated migration of nascent neurons from SVZ. Different from ICV administration, TGF-&#x003b2;1 may localize high concentration in the striatum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] rather than adjacent SVZ after intranasal administration, and lead to enhanced migration from SVZ into ischemic region. As expected, double immunostaining showed that after treatment with TGF-&#x003b2;1, most BrdU-labeled cells were co-labeled with DCX, a microtubule-associated protein expressed in migrating neuroblasts, which confirmed the previous assumption. Furthermore, we found an increased number of BrdU/NeuN double-labeled cells in the SVZ and affected striatum of TGF-&#x003b2;1 treated group at the anaphase after stroke, whereas only a few cells were GFAP positive, which suggest that intranasal administration of TGF-&#x003b2;1 also promoted progenitor's differentiation towards a neuronal lineage. Taken together, above findings indicate that stroke-induced neurogenensis is facilitated after intranasal administration of TGF-&#x003b2;1.</p><p>Endogenous TGF-&#x003b2;1 is distributed in the proliferative zone, and its two receptors T&#x003b2;RI, T&#x003b2;RII are expressed by migrating neurons and radial glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recently, we reported that intranasal administration of TGF-&#x003b2;1 may exert its biological effects by regulating gene expression of T&#x003b2;RI and T&#x003b2;RII, but did not affect mRNA level of TGF-&#x003b2;1 itself, suggesting that the enhanced neurogenesis by TGF-&#x003b2;1 might be mediated through its receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is known that neurogenesis is linked to the cell cycle, and neural stem cells may assume their particular neuronal or glial fates by exiting the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In addition, modification of molecular morphogens and signals in the microenvironment of developing brain affects stem cell survival and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;1 promotes exit from the cell cycle exit by upregulating the expression of the cell cycle protein, p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Exogenous administration of TGF-&#x003b2;1 may interact with the endogenous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], upregulate cell adhesion molecule (CAM) expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], increase the potency of other neurotrophic factors involved in neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], modulate their action, and affect the signaling of classic neurotrophins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and thus enhance stroke-induced neurogenesis. The exact mechamisms for the effects of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on neurogenesis are still remain to be proven.</p><p>In concert with our results, a recent report showed that TGF-&#x003b2;1 also increased neurogenesis both in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of the adrenalectomized rats and in neural stem cells cultures even at physiological concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Interestingly, some data from in vivo and/or in vitro studies indicate an adverse role of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in regulating neurogenesis. Wachs et al. reported that TGF-&#x003b2;1 induced a long-term inhibition of neurogenesis in the lateral ventricular wall and the dentate gyrus after 7 days of ICV infusion to adult female Fischer-344 rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Buckwalter et al. observed that chronic overproduction of TGF-&#x003b2;1 also inhibited age-related neurogenesis in the hippocampus of aged transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. These discrepancies may be related to the dose of TGF-&#x003b2;1. In contrast to other neurotrophins, TGF-&#x003b2;1 has been shown to produce a marked effect in a concentration-dependent manner. In developing cortex, cell migration was promoted by TGF-&#x003b2;1 at low concentrations whereas at high concentrations it impaired migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The decision of whether a community of progenitors undergoes predominantly neurogenesis or apoptosis is dependent on the concentration of TGF-&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It is likely that the effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on neurogenesis is also dose-dependent, related to the concentration achieved in the brain and also to the period of time that it remains elevated.</p><p>As a non-invasive method which bypasses the BBB, intranasal administration is an alternative drug delivery strategy for targeting the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Using this method, neuropeptides can be delivered to the brain directly from the nasal cavity for the time and treatment period needed. Two possible mechanisms shown to directly deliver drugs from the nasal mucosa to the brain along the neural pathway are the extracellular and the intracellular routes. Extracelluar transport along perineuronal and perivascular channels has been proposed to explain delivery of drugs to the brain within minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], whereas intracellular delivery requiring internalization of the drug within the neurons followed by axonal transport takes more than a few hours for drug distribution within the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We previously reported that TGF-&#x003b2;1 concentrations were significantly increased in several brain regions within 30 minutes after intranasal administration, while no increase was detected in the plasma and peripheral organs, suggesting that intranasal TGF-&#x003b2;1 is mainly transported into the CNS via extracellular neuronal pathways. Moreover, it was observed that the concentration of TGF-&#x003b2;1 following nasal delivery was sustained for at least 6 hours in some brain regions, such as striatum, thalamus, hippocampus and cortex, suggesting long-term stability of TGF-&#x003b2;1 tissue concentration when given via the nasal route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, intranasal administration of TGF-&#x003b2;1 represents a promising modality for facilitating neuroprotection, neurogenesis and recovery of function after stroke. Whether direct neuroprotection, neurogenesis, or both contribute to the reduction of infarct volume and the improvement in neurological function requires future investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study shows that neuroprotection, neurogenesis in the SVZ and functional recovery of the adult mouse brain are enhanced by intranasal TGF-&#x003b2;1 and may contribute to long-term repair following brain ischemia. Intranasal TGF-&#x003b2;1 may be an effective strategy for treating cerebrovascular disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Focal cerebral ischemia procedure</title><p>Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee (Institute of Science and Technology, Jiangsu Province, China). All procedures were performed under the guideline published in the NIH <italic>guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals </italic>(National Institutes of Health Publication No. 85-23, revised 1985). Every effort was made to minimize pain and discomfort.</p><p>Adult male C57BL/6 mice (n = 50) weighing 25&#x02013;30 g (Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University) were used for all experiments. Mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (10 %, 400 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Stroke was induced by intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with a monofilament according to Zea Longa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In brief, the right common carotid artery, the right external carotid artery and the internal carotid artery were exposed via a midline incision. A 8-mm long 8-0 monofilament, with its tip rounded by heating near a flame, was advanced from the external carotid artery stump into the right internal carotid artery to occlude the origin of the right middle cerebral artery. Ninety minutes after occlusion, the filament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion. The rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0&#x02013;37.5&#x000b0;C with a heating pad throughout the surgical procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Intranasal administration</title><p>Animals were randomly divided into control (n = 30) and TGF-&#x003b2;1 groups (n = 20). Recombinant human TGF-&#x003b2;1 (PeproTech Inc, USA) was dissolved in normal saline to a final concentration of 50 &#x003bc;g/ml. Intranasal administration was performed as described previously with some modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Two hours after MCAO, mice were re-anesthetized with chloral hydrate (10 %, 200 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and placed on their backs. A total volume of 20 &#x003bc;l solution per mouse containing 1 &#x003bc;g TGF-&#x003b2;1 or saline was given as 2 &#x003bc;l drops into the left and right nares, alternating sides at 2 minutes intervals over a period of 20 minutes.

NSS is a functional evaluation composite of motor, sensory, reflex and balance tests. The score was graded from 0 to 18 (normal score, 0; maximal deficit score, 18). Severe injury is indicated by a score of 13 to 18, moderate injury 7 to 12, and mild injury 1 to 6. In the severity scores of impairment, one point is scored for the inability to perform the task or lacking proper response for a given reflex.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue preparation and infarct volume measurement</title><p>At 7, 14, 21 or 28 days after stroke, mice (n = 6 in control group and n = 4 in TGF-&#x003b2;1 group at each time point) were deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate and perfused transcardially with 150 ml saline, followed by 150 ml 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4&#x000b0;C. Brains were post-fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 6 hours and cryoprotected in 30 % sucrose solution overnight. Twenty micrometer coronal sections, spaced 200 &#x003bc;m apart, encompassing the SVZ were cut with a cryostat and stored at -80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Every 40th coronal section from total brain was stained with hematoxylin.
