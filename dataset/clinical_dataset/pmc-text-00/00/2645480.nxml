The primary consequences of TLR activation is NF-&#x003ba;B activation and cytokine secretion in epithelial cells. To investigate LPS-triggered NF-&#x003ba;B activation, we first determined the dose response by treating HUCL cells with different concentration of LPS ranging from 1 ng to 10 &#x000b5;g/ml. We observed that LPS did not induce NF-&#x003ba;B as assessed by I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; phosphorylation in HUCL cells up to 10 &#x000b5;g/ml, whereas 1 &#x000b5;g/ml LPS significantly induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation in THK cells (data not shown). A time-course study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) showed that LPS (1 &#x000b5;g/ml) in KBM had no apparent effect on the levels of phospho-I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; and I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; in HUCL cells for up to 8 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, M9-conditioned medium derived from PAO1 culture (1:20 dilution) induced I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; phosphorylation and degradation in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that HCECs are responsive to PAO1 exoproducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, in THK cells LPS stimulated rapid I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; phosphorylation and I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; degradation that was maximal at 15 min post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, LPS induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation in THK, but not in HUCL cells.</p><p id="P7">To assess the biological relevance of induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation, we measured the effect of LPS on proinflammatory cytokine expression and production (secretion) in HCECs and keratocytes. The effect of LPS on IL-8 mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR. IL-8 mRNA was not detectable in untreated or 1 &#x000b5;g/ml LPS-challenged HUCL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, a PCR product of the expected size (347 bp) was observed in HUCL cells 30 min post-stimulation with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> conditioned medium; the band intensity increased, peaked at 2 h, and was still detectable at 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar to HUCL cells, IL-8 mRNA in unstimulated THK cells was barely detectable. However, incubation with LPS resulted in an increase in the expression of IL-8 mRNA in THK cells in a time-dependent manner.</p><p id="P8">The effect of LPS on IL-6 and IL-8 secretion by HUCL cells was assessed by ELISA. Consistent with a lack of NF-&#x003ba;B activation, there was no induced accumulation of IL-6 and IL-8 in HUCL cells treated with either 100 ng/ml or 1 &#x000b5;g/ml LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). These cells however, responded to a challenge of 250 ng/ml flagellin that served as a positive control by producing significantly more IL-8 (5.8 fold) and IL-6 (2.6 fold) as compared to the control untreated cells (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). To examine whether CD14 or LPS binding protein (LBP) is responsible for the unresponsiveness of HUCL cells to LPS challenge, human serum that provides soluble CD14 and/or LBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> was added to the culture. No significant increase in IL-6 or IL-8 production was observed in LPS-challenged HUCL cells with or without human serum. THK cells, on the other hand, produced significantly more IL-6 and IL-8 in response to the LPS challenge even without the addition of serum. 100 ng/ml LPS was as effective as 1 &#x000b5;g/ml LPS in inducing the secretion of the cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together, LPS differentially stimulates resident corneal cells by inducing IL-6 and IL-8 production in THK, but not in HUCL cells.</p><p id="P9">Recently, Ueta et al reported the intracellular localization of TLR4 in HCECs. To confirm TLR4 localization in HCECs, HUCL cells were biotinylated with plasma membrane-impermeable NHS-LC-biotin, followed by avidin precipitation of biotinylated proteins and Western blotting with TLR antibodies. While HUCL cells expressed abundant TLR4, there was no surface biotinylated TLR4 detected.

While CD14 was expressed in both epithelial and stromal fibroblasts (data not shown), MD-2 was found to be abundantly expressed in THK cells as well as in THP-1 cells (a human monocytic leukemia cell line, sensitive to LPS), but not in HCECs, including both the HUCL cell line and primary HCECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Little or no RT-PCR amplicons of MD-2 were detected in either HUCL cells or primary HCECs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P11">In this study, we showed that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> LPS stimulates the activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in human corneal stromal fibroblast cells, but fails to activate an inflammatory response in HCECs. We demonstrated that HCECs express abundant TLR4 intracellularly. However, there was no detectable increase in LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation or production of proinflammatory cytokines in these cells exposed to LPS for up to 24 h. This finding is consistent with that reported by Ueta <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> We further demonstrated that the unresponsiveness of HCECs to LPS challenge is likely due to the lack of MD-2 expression in HCECs. Human corneal stromal fibroblast cells, on the other hand, expressed TLR4 and MD-2 and responded to LPS challenge by secreting proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, the cornea is able to recognize LPS once it has penetrated into the stroma, and mounts an innate immune response to the invading pathogens by producing proinflammatory cytokines that recruit PMN into the site of infection.</p><p id="P12">Bacterial endotoxins (LPS) are among the most potent inducers of innate immune responses and are a major virulence factor of Gram-negative bacteria including <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The structural analysis of LPS divides the molecule into a hydrophobic lipid A region, which replaces phospholipids in the outer membrane, a central core oligosaccharide region, and a repeating polysaccharide portion referred to as O antigen or O polysaccharide. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> The O-antigen portion of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> LPS is responsible for conferring serogroup specificity, which is defined by antibodies specific to the different variants of this antigen. Recent studies revealed that the inflammatory response to LPS in cells is mediated by its interaction with TLR4. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref> Molecular interaction studies showed that TLR4 is essential for the recognition of the lipid A portion of bacterial LPS,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref> and mediates both effective host resistance to infection as well as some of the pathology associated with LPS-induced shock. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref> Therefore, it should be noted that the Pseudomonas LPS used in this study is unlikely to influence TLR4 signaling regardless of its serotype. A previous study by Pier et al showed that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> LPS induces less inflammation and lower overall host responses compared with that induced by enterobacterial (<italic>E. coli</italic>) LPS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref> However, more recent studies showed a high degree of variability in the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lipid A structure that can be synthesized depending on the strain and growth conditions, and have also shown that TLR4-mediated responses are highly dependent on the level of acylation of lipid A .<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref></p><p id="P13">A maximally sensitive response to LPS requires the sequential participation of several extracellular and cell-surface LPS-binding proteins, including LBP, CD14, MD-2, and TLR4. Briefly, LBP binds to Gram-negative bacteria or aggregates of LPS, thus decreasing the binding energy of LPS monomers. The LPS molecule is shuttled to CD14, which transfers the LPS to MD-2. The binding of lipid A to MD-2 causes the rearrangement of TLR4, leading to the association of its intracellular TIR domains and the recruitment of adapter proteins. Therefore, MD-2 plays a pivotal role in LPS sensing, bridging the recognition of endotoxins initiated by LBP and CD14 in response to the activation of TLR4 to pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref> The responsiveness of epithelial cells to LPS appears to be tissue-specific; respiratory, gastric and bladder epithelial cells have been shown to be activated by LPS, whereas intestinal and oral epithelial cells fail to recognize and respond to LPS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref> The reason for endotoxin hyporesponsiveness of intestinal epithelial cells is low levels of TLR4 and/or MD-2.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p id="P14">In the cornea, an early study showed that HCECs express TLR4 and CD14 and respond to LPS stimulation through the production of IL-6, IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-8 and TNF-&#x003b1;. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> However, a recent study by Ueta et al revealed that HCECs are unresponsive to LPS challenge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Our results are consistent with that reported by Ueta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> We also confirmed intracellular localization of TLR4 in HCECs. The intracellular expression of TLR4 was suggested to be an underlying mechanism for the immunosilent environment at the ocular mucosal epithelium. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Similarly, TLR4 was also found intracellularly in pulmonary and intestinal epithelial cells, but intracellular TLR4 in these cells is capable of recognizing internalized LPS. Since we showed that HCECs respond to flagellin through TLR5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>, which shares the MyD88-dependent signaling pathways with TLR4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>, the unresponsiveness of HCECs to TLR4 ligand is not due to defects in intracellular signal transduction, but more likely due to the lack of molecules required for proper LPS-TLR4 interaction. CD14 and MD-2 are critical co-receptors for TLR4 signaling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref> MD-2 and LPS form complexes that induce TLR4-expressing epithelial cells to secrete IL-6,, IL-8, andMD-2. Thus, the LPS-MD-2 complex plays a crucial role in the LPS response by activating epithelial cells in the inflammatory microenvironment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">54</xref> Our results have shown that there was little or no MD-2 mRNA detected in HCECs, in both HUCL cell lines as well as in primary cultured cells. In line with our study, the low level of MD2 expression in intestinal epithelial cells was attributed to the hyporesponsiveness of these cells to LPS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> Although the role of MD2 in LPS internalization has not been reported, the lack of MD-2 expression may also be responsible for the failure of HCECs to internalize LPS in vitro and in vivo. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref> A more recent study also showed that human conjunctival epithelial cells are unresponsive to LPS due to the lack of MD2 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>. Thus, we conclude that the lack of MD-2 is a major factor which is responsible for the LPS signaling defect in HCECs, and for the tolerance of the cornea towards the constant exposure of bacteria and non-threatening amounts of bacterial endotoxins.</p><p id="P15">While HCECs are unresponsive to LPS, the underlying stromal fibroblasts, keratocytes, are rapidly activated by LPS. Unlike epithelia, stromal cells are not constantly exposed to bacteria or their products. When tissues such as the cornea are exposed to bacteria, the barrier function of epithelium would prevent bacteria from direct interaction with TLRs which are usually located in the inner cell layers of stratified epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref> or on the basolateral side of simple epithelium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>. Because of the barrier function and the unique localization of TLRs, the released endotoxin may also exhibit minimal effects on epithelial cells. However, once the barrier is breached and bacteria invade the epithelial layer, the pattern recognizing receptors, such as TLR5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">59</xref>, recognize the pathogens in the epithelial layer and initiate corneal innate immune responses by producing antimicrobial molecules such as hBD2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">61</xref> and recruiting neutrophils via IL-8. Many pathogens may be eliminated upon initial contact by this mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">62</xref>. However, this initial defense may be overwhelmed by the pathogens, leading to the penetration of bacteria or released endotoxin into the stromal layer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>. In other mucosal epithelial cells (urinary, intestinal, and pulmonary), flagellin and TLR5 is the major responsive unit, not LPS-TLR4. We believe that the unresponsiveness of epithelial cells is a way to avoid unwanted inflammation as these epithelial linings, unlike immune cells, are constantly exposed to LPS, though not to flagellin. This exception occurs because flagellin is a protein which is usually not detected in the fluids that cover the epithelial lining in the body.</p><p id="P16">The presence of bacterial products such as flagellin and/or LPS in the stroma should act as a sign of stromal infection and a rapid response on the part of the resident cells is necessary for clearing the pathogens. The expression of functional TLR4, including its coreceptors CD14 and MD-2, and TLR5 (Yu et al, unpublished result) in keratocytes should allow the cells to rapidly recognize infection, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that recruit more neutrophils and monocytes to the infected stroma. It is interesting to note that corneal stromal fibroblasts stimulated with LPS secrete higher levels of cytokines than flagellin-stimulated HCECs when normalized with cellular proteins: over 2 times more IL-6 and approximately 15 times more IL-8 is secreted by THK cells. IL-8 is the major chemoattractant in the cornea for PMN infiltration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">64</xref>. Thus, the increased level of IL-8 released from keratocytes may attract a large number of PMN to the stroma that clear the pathogen and may also cause severe local inflammation, leading to the development of keratitis.</p><p id="P17">In summary, the data presented in this study demonstrate thatHCECs failed to respond to LPS. The unresponsiveness of HCECs is likely due to the lack of MD-2 expression, which is an important component of LPS-TLR4 signaling. Since the cornea is constantly exposed to environmental stimuli including LPS, these findings suggest that the human corneal epithelium possesses a regulatory mechanism, similar to that observed in intestinal epithelial cells, for the inhibition of TLR4-mediated innate immunity. However, the breakdown of the epithelial barrier during infection or trauma leads to a direct interaction of bacterial products with submucosal cells, i.e stromal keratocytes. Therefore these cells participate in innate immune responses by sensing and responding to bacterial products, such as LPS, that have penetrated into the subepithelial compartment of the cornea. Thus, targeting TLR4-mediated signaling pathways in keratocytes may permit the development of novel, specific therapies that could promote innate defense and prevent some of the destructive consequences of ocular Gram-negative bacterial infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S5"><title>Purification and preparation of P. aeruginosa LPS and conditioned medium</title><p id="P18">Commercially available LPS derived from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Catalog no.
