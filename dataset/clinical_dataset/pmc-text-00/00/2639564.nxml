This distinct histologic pattern has been described in various organs, including the urinary bladder, lung, ovary, colon, stomach, pancreas, and major salivary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. IMPC is usually mixed with otherwise conventional carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and is therefore often referred to as carcinoma with a micropapillary component. IMPCs are all invariably associated with a high degree of aggressiveness, extensive lymphovascular invasion, extensive lymph node metastases, and poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 75-year-old Japanese woman with inferior bile duct cancer presented. The patient had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy for her tumor surrounding the inferior common bile duct, measuring 11 mm on cut surface (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Microscopically, it was composed of conventional adenocarcinoma with severe neutrophilic infiltration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), and a small focus (2 mm in size) of micropapillary carcinoma was found in Oddi's sphincter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Carcinoma cells invaded the smooth muscle layer with foci of marked lymphatic invasion, although this lesion was small. The tumor was diagnosed as bile duct adenocarcinoma with a small amount of micropapillary carcinoma. Resected regional lymph nodes revealed micrometastasis of a few cancer cells in a micropapillary pattern only in one lymph node (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The patient is alive and free of the recurrent disease at the latest followup (after 1 year since the operation).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Gross finding of the tumor</bold>.

This "inside-out growth" structure has been attributed to the rotation of cell polarization, whereby the stroma-facing (basal) surface of the cells acquires "apical" properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This inversion of cell polarity has been disclosed immunohistochemically by the outer membranous staining pattern of EMA only toward the stroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Compared with conventional carcinomas of similar size, hypothetically this reverse polarization in IMPC facilitates the secretion by tumor cells of molecules, such as metalloproteinases, known to be responsible for stromal and vascular invasion, permitting easier dissemination and a higher tendency for lymph node metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>All pancreatic micropapillary carcinoma reported arose from the ampullo-pancreatobiliary region (pancreatic head). Occurrence of the micropapillary component in the adenocarcinoma of gastrointestinal tract may be attributable to the continuous exposure of the mucosa to bile acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Taken together, it is suggested that the effect of bile juice especially the reflux may be important as an etiological factor of the micropapillary carcinoma in this region (around pancreatic head).</p><p>On the other hand, invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the ampullo-pancreatobiliary region is often associated with tumor-infiltrating neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In this case, numerous neutrophils were found around conventional adenocarcinoma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and there was mild eosinophilic infiltration around micropapillary component (not shown). The phenomenon (neutrophilic infiltration) was not reported in micropapillary carcinomas of other organs other than pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and unexplained factors, such as chemotactic factors, may be responsible.</p><p>This case is bile duct cancer with small foci (2 mm in size) of micropapillary component. No reports have described the prognosis of cancer with such a small portion of micropapillary carcinoma. Because the presence of the minor micropapillary component may be ignored, carcinomas with a minor micropapillary component need to be carefully analyzed or followed up to understand their pathologic and prognostic characters.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the first case of bile duct cancer with minor micropapillary component metastasizing to the regional lymph node as a micrometastasis is reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.
