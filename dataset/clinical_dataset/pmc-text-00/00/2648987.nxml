Originally characterized from platelets, microvesicles are a normal constituent of human plasma, where they play an important role in maintaining hematostasis. Microvesicles have been shown to transfer proteins and RNA from cell to cell and they are also believed to play a role in intercellular communication. We characterized the RNA and protein content of embryonic stem cell microvesicles and show that they can be engineered to carry exogenously expressed mRNA and protein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). We demonstrate that these engineered microvesicles dock and fuse with other embryonic stem cells, transferring their GFP. Additionally, we show that embryonic stem cells microvesicles contain abundant microRNA and that they can transfer a subset of microRNAs to mouse embryonic fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic>. Since microRNAs are short (21&#x02013;24 nt), naturally occurring RNAs that regulate protein translation, our findings open up the intriguing possibility that stem cells can alter the expression of genes in neighboring cells by transferring microRNAs contained in microvesicles. Embryonic stem cell microvesicles may be useful therapeutic tools for transferring mRNA, microRNAs, protein, and siRNA to cells and may be important mediators of signaling within stem cell niches.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circulating platelet-derived vesicles were first identified in human plasma in the 1960's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Wolf1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. These vesicles, called microvesicles or microparticles, are heterogeneous in size and range from &#x0223c;30 nm to 1 &#x003bc;m. Previously believed to be inert cellular debris, microvesicles are now gaining acceptance as important mediators of intercellular communication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Abrahams1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Greco1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, microvesicles may mediate intercellular communication by transporting bioactive lipids, mRNA, or proteins between cells. Microvesicles have been identified from many cellular sources including monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, leukocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Abrahams1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Martinez1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Morel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-BajKrzyworzeka1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, microvesicles were isolated from embryonic stem cells. These embryonic stem cell microvesicles (ESMVs) were capable of reprogramming hematopoietic progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Ratajczak1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that microvesicles are capable of providing stem cells with extrinsic cues, which may regulate stem cell proliferation, and fate in stem cell niches. Shedding of microvesicles is a normal physiological process and is interestingly related to high rates of cellular proliferation. Cellular stress and damage, however, can also result in the release of membrane microvesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Ratajczak2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Beaudoin1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Hugel1">13</xref>. In humans, microvesicles play an essential role in maintaining hematostasis. A reduction in the number of platelet microvesicles causes a bleeding disorder called Scott Syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Sims1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Elevated levels of microvesicles are also associated with a variety of disorders including acute coronary syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, and pulmonary embolism (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Boulanger1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>). In addition to maintaining hematostasis, microvesicles have also been implicated in carrying membrane bound morphogens in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Greco1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, and they may influence the behavior and survival of hematopoietic progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Ratajczak1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-BajKrzyworzeka1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The mechanism by which ESMVs may mediate intercellular signaling could involve the activation of receptors on the recipient cell by ligands in the ESMV. In this manner, ESMVs would be able to carry membrane bound ligands considerable distances from their stem cell origin. Alternatively, ESMVs may be able to mediate signaling by the direct transfer of proteins, RNA, or bioactive lipids to the recipient cell, serving as &#x0201c;physiological liposomes&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Ratajczak1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Ratajczak2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. If ESMVs can indeed serve as &#x0201c;physiological liposomes,&#x0201d; transferring RNA and proteins to cells, they can perhaps be used to deliver exogenously expressed genes for therapeutic purposes. To explore this possibility, we first characterized the RNA and protein content of ESMVs and whether they carry the mRNA and protein expressed from a transgene present in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). We then investigated the ability of ESMVs to transfer GFP to recipient cells. We also explored the possibility that ESMVs can transport and transfer microRNAs (miRNAs) to cells. MiRNAs are a group of small (21&#x02013;24nt) noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in mammals by binding to the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs to repress translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-LagosQuintana1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Lee1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. miRNAs have been found in peripheral blood microvesicles of healthy individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Hunter1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and in ovarian tumor microvesicles circulating in the peripheral blood of patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Dahiya1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. We show that ESMVs are capable of transferring a subset of miRNAs to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), suggesting a tightly regulated transfer process. Transfer of miRNAs by microvesicles represents a novel method of paracrine signaling, potentially making microvesicles important components of stem cell niches. It also opens up the possibility of transferring siRNAs via microvesicles. The delivery of siRNAs by microvesicles may be particularly useful in the treatment of retinal disorders such as age related macular degeneration, since injection of naked siRNAs into the eye may have deleterious effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Hunter1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ESMV RNA profile</title><p>Although ESMVs have been reported to contain mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004722-Ratajczak1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, little was known about their total RNA profile or the quality and types of RNA that they contain.

Perhaps the transfer of miRNAs is an active process, possibly regulated by proteins found in microvesicles or receptors found on recipient cells. Alternatively, the abundance of miRNAs may be tightly regulated by specific nucleases such that miR-16 levels inside MEFs are kept within a specific range, but the ESC specific miRNAs are not. In our experiments, we tested the ability of ESMVs to transfer miRNAs to growth-arrested MEFs. We can speculate that the efficiency of transfer may be different, perhaps even enhanced, with rapidly dividing or proliferating cells such as those found in a developing blastocyst.

The insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000&#x000d7;g for 1 hour at 4&#x000b0;C. The soluble fraction was collected and precipitated with 20&#x00025; trichloroacetic acid (TCA), washed twice with ice-cold acetone and separated on a Tris-glycine buffered 4&#x02013;20&#x00025; SDS-polyacrylamide gel.</p><p>To detect GFP protein, the ultracentrifuged ESMV pellet was resuspended in ice-cold cell disruption buffer from the mirVana Paris kit (Ambion) and the total protein was quantified using the Bradford assay. Crude protein preparations were stored frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C or used immediately for analysis. Prior to loading, the samples were heated to 87&#x02013;90&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes in sample buffer containing 0.2M DTT and 1.8M beta-mercaptoethanol. Total protein (20 &#x003bc;g per sample) was separated on a 8&#x00025;T/3&#x00025;C, 6M urea, SDS-polyacrylamide gel using a Tris/glycine buffer system, and transferred to a PVDF membrane overnight. GFP was detected with 1&#x02236;1000 diluted rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies (Molecular Probes) and 1&#x02236;5000 diluted horse anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Vector Labs). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3&#x02032;-indolylphosphate p-toluidine salt and nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride (BCIP/NBT).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Transfer of GFP to ES cells</title><p>Immediately after passaging, 200 &#x003bc;l of ESCs (&#x0223c;10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) were transferred to a culture tube in serum-free medium with 1 &#x003bc;l of Vybrant DiD (Molecular Probes). The cells were incubated for 20 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C, and then washed 2&#x000d7; with pre-warmed DMEM. After the last wash, the cells were resuspended in 200 &#x003bc;l serum-free medium and separated into two tubes. An additional 100 &#x003bc;l of serum-free medium was added to one tube serving as control and 100 &#x003bc;l of ESMVs containing GFP (collected from 3-4 T175 flasks) were added to the second tube. Both tubes were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 3 hrs prior to imaging the cells on a Leica TCS-SP inverted confocal microscope. Images were taken with a 100&#x000d7;, 1.4 NA plan apochromatic objective. Excitation was achieved with the 488nm laser line for GFP and the 633nm laser line for DiD. The spectral detector was set to 498&#x02013;531nm for GFP and 650&#x02013;714nm for DiD detection. All images were taken with the pinhole set to 1 airy unit. The DiD image was overlayed on the GFP image after digitization using the Leica confocal software or Adobe Photoshop CS2.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Transfer of miRNAs to embryonic fibroblasts</title><p>Approximately 1.6&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/well of gamma-irradiated MEFs were pre-plated on 24 well plates at least 2 days prior to initiation of the experiment. ESMVs isolated from 6 T175 flasks (as described above) were divided evenly between all samples and co-incubated with the pre-plated MEFs. Growth-arrested MEFs were used to maintain a constant ratio of ESMVs to MEFs between each experiment since we do not know if ESMVs have any effect on the growth or proliferation of MEFs. Each experimental series included a negative control (MEF only) and 4 experimental time points (MEF&#x0002b;ESMVs). We collected MEFs after 1, 12, 36, and 54 hours. To collect the cells while removing free-floating ESMVs, MEFs were washed with PBS twice prior to dissociation. MEFs were then enzymatically dissociated from the plates and washed two more times with PBS. After each wash, cells were spun down at 3500&#x000d7;g for 5 minutes so that any residual ESMVs would float in the supernatant and be discarded. We isolated the MEF total RNA and performed real time quantitative RT-PCR with a subset of miRNAs using the protocol described above. As an indirect measure of miRNA transfer, we determined the difference in Ct values between the negative control and each experimental time point; a positive value indicated transfer. If no signal was detected, a Ct value of 40 was assigned to the sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Bootstrap statistics</title><p>Bootstrap statistics emulates real life by generating random and independent data points from the original data set using computer-intensive programs.

For bootstrap t-tests comparing the 5&#x02032;&#x02236;3&#x02032; ratio of ESCs with ESMVs, the initial template values were normalized as described above. Pseudogroups of the normalized values were randomly generated with replacement and the 5&#x02032;&#x02236;3&#x02032; ratios were calculated from the pseudogroup means. The difference between the 5&#x02032;&#x02236;3&#x02032; ratios for ESMVs and ESCs was resampled 10,000 times and binned to determine the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile confidence intervals for acceptance of the null hypothesis. For bootstrap ANOVA, the pseudogroups were generated from the relative quantity of each transcript or miRNA tested. The medians of these pseudogroups were resampled 10,000 times and binned to determine the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile confidence intervals and for calculating the F-ratio.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The CAGGS-eGFP ESC line was a generous gift from T.
