Thedecreased prevalence of hyperopia in the rural population couldbe due to the influence of lens causing early nuclear sclerosisand hence an associated myopic shift. The urban populationshowed an increasing trend of hyperopia with age similar tothe findings reported by APEDS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> and several other studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>Hyperopia prevalence was found to be significantly higheramong women than men in the urban population as seen inthe rural. This female preponderance has also been reported inseveral other studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref> Women have been reported to haveshorter axial length than men in a subset of our population,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>which could explain the increased prevalence of hyperopiaamong women in our study.</p><p>The prevalence of astigmatism was found to be 54.78%in the rural population and 53.03% in the urban population.The prevalence in both populations was found to significantlyincrease with age as reported by studies in the South EastAsian populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref> Against the rule astigmatismwas found to be predominant in both populations similar to the findingreported by the Blue Mountains eye study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> and the APEDS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> Theprevalence of against the rule astigmatism significantly increasedwith age and with the rule astigmatism significantly decreasedwith age in both populations. One of the postulated reasons isincreased lid laxity with age causing flattening of the verticalcorneal meridian thereby decreasing with the rule astigmatismand increasing against the rule astigmatism with age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></p><p>In conclusion, 70.63% of the urban population and 49.40%of the rural population had refractive errors, while only 59.40%in urban and 17.20% in the rural population used refractivecorrection. Prevalence of spectacle use was significantly lowerin the rural population. This is a substantial proportion of thepopulation that has correctable visual impairment and is notusing glasses. The difference in usage pattern between bothpopulations could be related to differences in the penetration ofophthalmic services or differences in perceived need for the useof glasses. The other finding was that the pattern of refractiveerrors was different for both cohorts - this could largely beexplained by the emmetropization of the rural populationsecondary to lenticular myopia. Early nuclear lenticular changessignificantly influence the pattern of refractive errors in therural population. It potentially leads to emmetropization of thehyperopic error and increased index myopia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Source of Support: Chennai Willingdon Corporate
