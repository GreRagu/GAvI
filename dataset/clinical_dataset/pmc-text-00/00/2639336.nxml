A major event in the induction of renal injury is related to the generation of oxygen-free radicals. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) is indicated for treatment of many ischaemic events but not for ARF. Therefore, the present study examined the effects of HBO on kidney function and renal haemodynamics in rats with ischaemic ARF.</p><p><bold>Methods.</bold> Renal ischaemia was induced by unilateral renal artery clamping (45 min) in rats. Within 24 h following ischaemia, rats were treated twice with HBO of 100% O<sub>2</sub> at 2.5 absolute atmospheres for 90 min each (+HBO). Untreated rats (&#x02212;HBO) served as a control. Forty-eight hours later, GFR, RBF and endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation were measured. In addition, the immunoreactive staining of 4-hydroxy-2-noneal (4-HNE), a major product of endogenous lipid peroxidation, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were assessed.</p><p><bold>Results.</bold> In the &#x02212;HBO group, GFR was reduced by 94% compared with the untouched normal kidney (ischaemic: 0.06 &#x000b1; 0.03 ml/min, normal: 1.02 &#x000b1; 0.13 ml). In contrast, in the +HBO group, GFR of the ischaemic kidney (0.36 &#x000b1; 0.07 ml/min) was reduced only by 68% compared with the contralateral normal kidney (1.12 &#x000b1; 0.12 ml/min). In line with these findings, HBO improved the vasodilatory response to ACh as expressed in enhancement of both total and regional renal blood flow. In addition, HBO reduced the formation of 4-HNE by 33% and 76% and increased SOD by 30% and 70% in the cortex and outer stripe region of the medulla of the ischaemic kidney, respectively.</p><p><bold>Conclusion.</bold> HBO attenuates the decline in GFR following renal ischaemia, and improves endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation, suggesting that treatment with HBO may be beneficial in the setting of ischaemic ARF.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>acute kidney injury</kwd><kwd>hyperbaric oxygen</kwd><kwd>ischaemia-reperfusion injury</kwd><kwd>rat</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute renal failure (ARF) continues to be a frequent threatening complication following trauma and complex surgical procedures, and in patients hospitalized in intensive care units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2">1,2</xref>]. Despite the increasing awareness of this syndrome, the advances in clinical care and extensive research of its pathophysiology, the mortality from ARF remains high and has not changed significantly during the last several decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>].</p><p>Ischaemic kidney injury continues to play a dominant role in the pathogenesis of ARF in many surgical and medical settings. Recent investigations into the mechanisms of renal damage following ischaemia in animal models suggest an early contribution of endothelial dysfunction and a local inflammatory response as major components of the evolving ischaemic injury to the kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3 R4 R5">3&#x02013;5</xref>]. As a consequence of these events, the recovery of blood supply to the ischaemic kidney may be significantly delayed and reduced leading to further impairment of tissue oxygenation.</p><p>A major event in the induction of tissue injury is related to the generation of oxygen-free radicals and the associated oxidative and nitrosative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4 R5 R6">4&#x02013;6</xref>]. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the highly reactive hydroxyl radical and the nitric oxide (NO) metabolic product, peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), are generated during the renal reperfusion phase and have diverse cytotoxic properties. These include damage to DNA, protein oxidation and nitrosylation, lipid peroxidation and induction of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) is defined as a treatment in which a patient is intermittently exposed to 100% oxygen while the treatment chamber is pressurized to a pressure above sea level (&#x0003e;1 ATA, 760 mmHg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. HBO therapy has been used in a number of medical conditions with a proven efficacy in a limited number of disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8 R9 R10">8&#x02013;10</xref>]. In ischaemic rat tissues, HBO was shown to inhibit neutrophil adherence to the wall of ischaemic vessels and to decrease post-ischaemic vasoconstriction in skin grafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, we showed in our laboratory that HBO has striking beneficial anti-inflammatory effects on experimental colitis in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. In several experimental conditions, HBO has been claimed to exert its beneficial effects in part by increasing the activity of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and other antioxidant cellular defence mechanisms, thereby altering the balance between generation and removal of oxygen-free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13 R14 R15">13&#x02013;15</xref>].</p><p>Several investigators reported that HBO treatment may modulate kidney function in rats with sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], rats with adriamycin-induced nephrotic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] and experimental cyclosporine nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Recently, Solmazgul <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] demonstrated that HBO attenuated the elevation in plasma creatinine and histological damage in Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to renal ischaemia/reperfusion injury. Moreover, HBO treatment has been reported to be beneficial in the management of the muscle compartment syndrome, a devastating complication of crush syndrome, where kidney function is often impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] (reviewed in Reis ND and Better OS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]).</p><p>Here we report that HBO treatment following renal ischaemia/reperfusion attenuated the deterioration in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the ischaemic kidney, in parallel with an improvement in the antioxidant/oxidant balance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Studies were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) weighing 280&#x02013; 320 g.

This protocol was chosen based on previous experiments from our laboratory in rats with crush syndrome where HBO exerted beneficial effects on muscle function (unpublished observations). The chamber was pressurized with 100% oxygen to 2.5 absolute atmospheres (ATA).

In short, after tracheotomy, the rat was placed on a heated surgical table and the left carotid artery and right jugular vein were cannulated by polyethylene tubing (Portex, Hythe, Kent, UK) for continuous monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and infusion of various solutions, respectively. A solution of 2% inulin in 0.9% saline was infused at a rate of 1.0&#x02013;1.5% BW/h, throughout the experiment. The abdominal cavity was then exposed through a mid-abdominal incision, and the left ureter was identified, separated from the surrounding fat and cannulated by a PE-10 tube for urine collection. The urinary bladder was exposed, and a funnel-shaped PE-50 catheter was inserted for urine collection from the contralateral right kidney. Urine was collected separately from each kidney into pre-weighed tubes containing mineral oil, and the urine volume was measured gravimetrically. Following surgery, a 60-min equilibration period was allowed before the first clearance period was obtained. Four clearance periods of 20&#x02013;30 min each were obtained, and blood samples (0.3 ml) were withdrawn every second clearance period. Blood samples were separated by centrifugation, and plasma and urine aliquots were kept at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for determination of inulin concentration.

Baseline MAP did not differ significantly in the three experimental groups. Baseline RBF decreased by 26% in +HBO rats versus &#x02212;HBO rats. However, both were significantly lower compared with normal control kidney. In line with these measurements, calculated baseline RVR was higher (by 52%) in the ischaemic kidney of the +HBO group compared with the &#x02212;HBO group.</p><p>The results of the endothelial-dependent renal vasodilatation in response to ACh administration are depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. As shown, infusion of incremental doses of ACh produced a similar decrease in MAP in the three experimental groups (sham, ischaemic &#x02212;HBO and ischaemic +HBO), followed by a similar recovery response upon cessation of ACh infusion. In spite of the decrease in MAP, there was a dose-related rise in RBF in response to ACh in all groups, apparently as a result of an endothelial-dependent renal vasodilatation. Of interest, treatment with HBO (ischaemic kidney of +HBO) significantly improved the renal vasodilatory response to ACh as compared to ischaemic kidney of &#x02212;HBO. Indeed, as shown in the lower panel of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, there was a dose-dependent decrease in RVR in all three experimental groups, especially in ischaemic kidney of +HBO rats. This notion is further supported by the measurements of intrarenal blood flow in response to the ACh as depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. As shown, administration of ACh to control rats caused a gradual increase in CBF, which reached maximal magnitude of 35% &#x000b1; 8% above baseline value at 30 min after the drug injection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A), whereas MBF did not change significantly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). In contrast, in the ischaemic kidney of the &#x02212;HBO group, ACh elicited an attenuated increase in CBF (18 &#x000b1; 3% peak increase at 30 min after injection of the drug). The cortical vasodilatory response to ACh significantly improved following HBO treatment (CBF reached a peak increase of 28 &#x000b1; 11% at 30 min after injection of the drug). These findings may explain the observed stimulatory effects of HBO on total RBF, and suggest that treatment with HBO may improve endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation mediated by eNOS. It should be emphasized that basal CBF of normal kidney, ischaemic kidney and ischaemic kidney following HBO treatment was not significantly different: 309.9 &#x000b1; 11.95; 323.9 &#x000b1; 25.4 and 330.6 &#x000b1; 26.0 perfusion units, respectively.

Our data clearly demonstrate that treatment with HBO substantially attenuated the reduction in GFR characterizing ARF. The HBO-induced renal vasodilatation was associated with a significant increase in total RBF in response to ACh, due to enhanced perfusion of the renal cortex in the ischaemic kidney. Despite the improvement in renal haemodynamics, HBO did not cause a concomitant increase in urine flow or sodium excretion. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the improvement in renal function following HBO occurs in parallel with a similar increase in the antioxidant/oxidant ratio in the ischaemic kidney. This suggests that the latter mechanism may partially contribute to the improvement in renal function in kidneys recovering from ischaemic injury, and support the use of HBO for treatment of ARF.</p><p>Previously, Solmazgul <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] demonstrated that HBO treatment produced marked protection against ischaemia of 30 min followed by 24-h reperfusion after the right nephrectomy. These authors applied HBO therapy for 60 min, starting at the initial 15th min of reperfusion. Animals treated with HBO showed regression of the elevated plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels to normal concentrations in association with reversal of tubular damage and neutrophil infiltration. However, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of HBO therapy were not studied in this study. Our data clearly show that HBO treatment partially corrected the decline in GFR complicating ARF and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic actions of HBO in the I/R model of ARF. For instance, the beneficial effects of HBO on GFR in the +HBO group could be attributed to the observed concurrent improvement in endothelial function of the injured kidney following HBO. In that respect, rats with ARF that were treated with HBO displayed a more pronounced endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation in response to ACh compared with control animals, and the &#x02212;HBO group. This improvement was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in the 4-HNE level in renal tissue. 4-HNE, a major product of endogenous lipid peroxidation, is considered as a reliable indicator of oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26 R27">26,27</xref>]. It is well established that ROS directly cause vasoconstriction in kidney microcirculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, they indirectly increase vascular tone by affecting the action or production of vasodilatory substances of endothelial origin such as NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Therefore, the observed increased oxidative stress in the ischaemic kidney probably composes additional mechanism that could be responsible for the renal dysfunction occurring during ARF. The latter is compatible with our findings that the beneficial effect of HBO treatment on GFR was accompanied by enhancement of SOD abundance and decline in 4-HNE in the renal tissue. Similar results were obtained in sepsis-induced ARF, where renal dysfunction was associated with the reduction of renal SOD and catalase (CAT) activities and the increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, GFR recovered to normal values along with the reduction in oxidative damage by either HBO treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] or administration of an SOD mimetic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. Beneficial renal effects of antioxidant agents such as vitamin E, edaravone (radical scavenger) and melatonin were also reported in experimental models of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>], ischaemic ARF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>] and glycerol-induced ARF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>], respectively. Taken together, these studies indicate that oxygen-free radicals play a major role in renal injury of different aetiologies and that HBO treatment has a beneficial effect on renal dysfunction. The beneficial renal effect of HBO could be attributed to its anti-oxidative capacity. This notion is supported by our findings that HBO augmented the SOD immunoreativity in the renal tissue to normal levels and abolished the increase in 4-HNE. Similarly, several studies have demonstrated that HBO treatment increased the SOD and/or CAT activities in rat extensor digitorum longus muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], in pancreas and erythrocytes of rats with induced acute necrotizing pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], in the lungs of rats and guinea pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>] and in the erythrocytes of human patients with multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>].</p><p>The stimulatory effects of HBO treatment on the endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation induced by ACh in the ischaemic kidney hint that HBO treatment improves the function of the NO system, which plays an important role in the regulation of renal haemodynamic and kidney function. In line with these findings, several studies have shown that HBO increases the NO levels in the perivascular part of the aorta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>], and the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37 R38">37,38</xref>]. Similarly, Cabigas and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>] have recently demonstrated a cardioprotective effect of HBO in rats subjected to myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion. The authors suggested that the conferred cardioprotection was due to HBO-mediated increased association between heat-shock protein 90 (hsp90) and eNOS, which further augmented NO production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Additional studies are required to elucidate if similar mechanisms contributed to the enhanced recovery of GFR in our rats with ischaemic renal injury.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite the restoration and even enhanced endothelial-dependent response to ACh 48 h after ischaemic injury, baseline RBF was still lower in the &#x02212;HBO and +HBO ischaemic kidneys compared with the non-ischaemic control kidney. This could reflect the predominant effects of various vasoconstrictor, NO-independent, systems that are still present at this post-ischaemic stage and may control renal haemodynamics.</p><p>Since basal RBF was lower in the +HBO group as compared to the &#x02212;HBO group, this further decline in basal RBF following HBO treatment is consistent with the vasoconstrictive action of hyperoxygenation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. The mechanism(s) by which HBO treatment caused the increase in GFR were not clarified in the present study. Thus, the finding that despite the reduction in basal RBF, HBO caused a concomitant increase in GFR of the ischaemic kidneys might suggest that HBO induced a preferential vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole. Alternatively, it might be speculated that the observed enhancement in GFR was not related to haemodynamic changes, but rather to an improvement in the tubular integrity and function of the injured nephrons. Further studies will be required to elucidate the exact mechanisms of GFR improvement and the contribution of the alterations to oxidant/antioxidant balance in that regard.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates that acute ischaemic renal injury is associated with enhancement of renal oxidative stress and that HBO treatment has a potential in the recovery of GFR by improving the antioxidant/oxidant balance in the ischaemic kidney.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Prof. Samuel Heyman for reading the manuscript and for his helpful suggestions.
