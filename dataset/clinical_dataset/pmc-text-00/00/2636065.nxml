The statisticiandecided the numbers on the basis of average number of casesof squint operated in 6 months (study period), about 300 casesand assuming the expected prevalence to be about 25% (c.i,13 to 40%). A sample of 36 was required with power of study80% and alpha 5%. We planned equal number of cases in eachgroup, but is also a known fact that V patterns with bilateralinferior oblique over action (IOOA) are more common than Apatterns with bilateral superior oblique over action (SOOA).Each group was further subdivided into two types of obliquemuscle weakening procedure which was done randomly usingchit system. During randomization, each group was assignedtwo types of weakening procedures in equal halves and thechits were prepared accordingly.</p><p>Thirty - six consecutive cases of horizontal strabismuswith bilateral oblique muscle over action were recruited forthe study from the squint and amblyopia clinic of our center.Sixteen cases (32 eyes) had bilateral SOOA with significantA pattern which was (defined as a difference of more than10 prism diopter (pd) in the horizontal deviations in the upand down gazes, the deviation in the up gaze more than thedeviation in the downgaze in esodeviations and vice versa inexodeviations. These cases were randomly assigned to one ofthe two treatment groups (8 cases each) of superior obliqueweakening procedures- superior oblique silicone expander(SE) and translational recession (TR). Twenty cases (40 eyes)had bilateral IOOA with significant V pattern (defined as adifference of more than 15 pd in the horizontal deviations inthe up and down gazes, the deviation in the up gaze morethan the deviation in the downgaze in exodeviations and viceversa in esodeviations). These cases were randomly assignedto one of the 2 treatment groups (10 cases each) of inferioroblique weakening procedures- Fink&#x02032;s recession (FR) of 10mm and modified Elliot and Nankin&#x02032;s (MEN) inferior obliqueanteropositioning. All cases underwent appropriate horizontalmuscle surgery (without vertical displacement) in addition.</p><p>The study protocol was explained to the patients and theirparents (in case of minors) and an informed consent wasobtained. The study was performed as part of the doctoralthesis of one of the authors and was approved by the EthicsCommittee set up by the institute. Patients were excluded if theyhad a previous ocular surgery or if they were not cooperativefor orthoptic evaluation.</p><p>All the subjects included in the study underwent a completeorthoptic workup including measurement of cyclotorsion byobjective and subjective methods before and after the surgery.The binocular status in all the cases was assessed by theBagolini&#x02032;s striated glass.

A spirit level fixed tothe head ensured a proper head posture (horizontal intercanthalplane) while the fundus was photographed. The subject wasasked to fixate on the camera&#x02032;s internal fixation marker andthe photograph of the 50&#x000b0; field of the posterior pole centeredon the fovea was obtained on a 400 ASA film. A 5&#x02033; by 9&#x02033; sizepositive print was developed and the disc fovea angle (betweenthe line joining the fovea to the geometric center of the disc andthe horizontal line passing through the geometric center) wasmeasured from the print using a protractor.

None ofthe cases in our study were symptomatic with regard to thecyclotropia. Uncontrolled oblique muscle surgery in cases ofhorizontal strabismus with well-adapted cyclodeviations mayinduce torsional disparities through over or under corrections.If these disparities exceed the cyclofusional reserve, the patientmay become symptomatic for cyclodiplopia. It may also hinderthe development of fusion and finer stereopsis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Hence, it isimportant to know the cyclotorsional changes produced by thedifferent surgical procedures on the oblique muscles.</p><p>It is understood that horizontal muscle surgery alonedoes not alter the cyclodeviations, unless accompanied byvertical transpositioning or differential (slanting) recessionsor resections. Thus associated horizontal procedures were notconsidered to be responsible for the cyclodeviations.</p><p>Cyclodeviations can be measured by numerous methods, onlya few being useful clinically.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> The subjective methods includethe double Maddox rod (DMR),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> the Polaroid dissociation stereoprojector (PDS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> and the synoptophore,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> which was found to beuseful in this group of patients for measuring cyclodeviations.The advantages of the synoptophore include a better control ofthe patient&#x02032;s head, simultaneous correction of the horizontal andvertical deviations and ability to measure even small amountof cyclotorsion. The synoptophore however, is considered lessphysiological than the PDS, as it is more dissociative.</p><p>Objective assessment of cyclodeviation is best done bymeasuring the disc fovea angle on the fundus photograph doneusing a standard protocol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> as described above. Foveal location innormal patients is found to be 0.3 to 0.6 disc diameters below ahorizontal line extending temporally from the geometric centerof the optic nerve head creating a mean angle of 7.25&#x000b0; to 12.5&#x000b0;from the horizontal axis at the geometric center of the optic disc.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>In their study measuring cyclorotatory changes after inferioroblique muscle recession by subjective and objective methods,Schworm <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> have assumed a 7&#x000b0; excyclodeviation to indicatethe subjective zero cyclodeviation. The subjective and &#x02032;adjusted&#x02032;objective measurements still differed indicating adaptation.The possibility of modulation in the sensorial adaptation tocyclotropia was suggested by the differences in the preoperativeand postoperative measures of cyclotorsion by the subjectiveand objective methods.</p><p>Our study showed significant differences in the subjectiveand objective methods of measuring torsional changes, whichis highly suggestive of the presence of sensory adaptations.However the differences in the subjective and objectivemeasurements for the superior oblique weakening procedureswere lesser than those seen after the inferior oblique weakeningprocedures [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. This suggests that the torsional changesinduced by oblique muscle weakening procedures are onlypartially amenable to sensory adaptations, especially when thesuperior oblique is weakened.</p><p>While the postoperative subjective torsion was less than 1&#x000b0; inthe FR, MEN and the SE groups, the superior oblique TR groupshowed a subjective extorsion of -3.5&#x000b0; at 3-month postoperativefollow up. A number of patients were symptomatic for oculartorsion.</p><p>In our study the extorsional changes in cases with SOOAwas 3 times more after the TR surgery as compared to the SEsurgery. This can be explained by the loss of the fanning of thesuperior oblique tendon fibers in the TR surgery. The increasedweakening of the intorting action makes it a less physiologicalsuperior oblique weakening surgery. Harada <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> evaluatedthe effects of anterior partial recession of the superior obliquemuscle in cases of cyclovertical muscle abnormalities causingtorsional problems. They reported that a 6 mm recession of thesuperior oblique produced a mean extorsion change of 12&#x000b0;. Tothe best of our knowledge, this is the first report in literatureto have reported the torsional effects of the superior obliquerecession surgery.</p><p>There are numerous studies on the effect of inferior obliqueweakening procedures on ocular torsion. Harada <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>evaluated the effect of anterior partial recession of the inferioroblique on the torsional status and found a 1&#x000b0; change for every1 mm recession. Kushner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> evaluated the cyclorotatory effectsfollowing oblique muscle surgery objectively by noting theaxis of astigmatism and concluded that bilateral weakeningof the inferior oblique by recession caused an intorsion of theaxis of astigmatism of about 9.75&#x000b0;. Santiago <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> have shownoverall net change of 6.2&#x000b1; 4.8&#x000b0; in excyclotorsion after anteriortransposition of the inferior oblique adjacent to or anterior tothe inferior rectus insertion on objective measurement usingfundus photograph. Our findings also compared favorablywith the above studies. Both the procedures produced anequitable amount of intorsional shift, which is within the normalphysiological range. FR is a generalized weakening procedure,weakening all the functions (elevation, abduction and extorsion)of the inferior oblique equally. MEN procedure is also ageneralized weakening procedure but was expected to have anincreased effect on weakening the elevation and strengtheningthe extorsion because of the anteropositioning. However, itappears that the slack induced by the recession, neutralizesany significant increase in the extorsion produced by theanteropositioning. This also corroborates with the observationsform a previous study from the same center<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> wherein wecompared Parks&#x02032; method and the MEN anteropositioningwith pure anteropositioning. While Parks&#x02032; method produced atorsion change of 3&#x000b1;2.5&#x000b0; and the MEN procedure, a change of3.9&#x000b1;3.2&#x000b0;, &#x02032;pure&#x02032; anteropositioning produced a torsional changeof 0.36&#x000b1; 0.9&#x000b0;.</p><p>Some limitations of our study are a small sample size andinability to use subjective methods like DMR, due to the lackof binocularity. Further studies in acquired oblique muscleanomalies with binocularity may add to more useful data in afield with very few studies available.</p><p>We conclude that significant differences are seen in themeasurement of cyclotorsion by subjective and objectivemethods, implying the presence of compensatory mechanisms.The torsional changes produced by different oblique muscleweakening procedures vary, with the maximum effect seen inthe translation recession of the superior oblique. To preventsymptoms of postoperative cyclotorsion it is important tochoose procedures according to the amount of torsional changesproduced by them.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>The paper was
