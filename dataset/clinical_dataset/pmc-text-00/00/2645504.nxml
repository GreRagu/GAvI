For such spontaneous movements, a variety of different modes have been observed,                    including the amoeboid-like locomotion with protrusion of multiple pseudopods,                    the keratocyte-like locomotion with a widely spread lamellipodium, cell division                    with two daughter cells crawling in opposite directions, and fragmentations of a                    cell to multiple pieces. Mutagenesis studies have revealed that cells exhibit                    these modes depending on which genes are deficient, suggesting that seemingly                    different modes are the manifestation of a common mechanism to regulate cell                    motion. In this paper, we propose a hypothesis that the positive feedback                    mechanism working through the inhomogeneous distribution of regulatory proteins                    underlies this variety of cell locomotion and cytofission. In this hypothesis, a                    set of regulatory proteins, which we call cortical factors, suppress actin                    polymerization. These suppressing factors are diluted at the extending front and                    accumulated at the retracting rear of cell, which establishes a cellular                    polarity and enhances the cell motility, leading to the further accumulation of                    cortical factors at the rear. Stochastic simulation of cell movement shows that                    the positive feedback mechanism of cortical factors stabilizes or destabilizes                    modes of movement and determines the cell migration pattern. The model predicts                    that the pattern is selected by changing the rate of formation of the                    actin-filament network or the threshold to initiate the network formation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Actin is a globular protein, assembling (polymerizing) into filaments. This                    process is called actin polymerization. Cell biologists have revealed that actin                    polymerization plays a central role in eukaryotic cell locomotion. Stimulated by                    internal/external molecular signals, actin polymerization occurs just beneath                    the cellular membrane. Such actin polymerization gives rise to pressure to push                    the cellular membrane outwards, which pulls the cell body and induces cell                    locomotion. Here, an important question on the mechanism is how the area of                    actin polymerization in cell is determined. To answer this question, we                    introduce a simple computational model that includes actin and a control factor                    of actin polymerization, which we call &#x0201c;cortical                    factor&#x0201d;'. Cell shape deformation induces heterogeneous                    distribution of cortical factor, leading to the heterogeneous actin                    polymerization in cell, which further enhances cell shape deformation. This                    feedback mechanism consistently explains a variety of modes of spontaneous cell                    movement, including both cell locomotion and cell division-like behaviors. Those                    different modes of movement emerge depending on the rate of actin polymerization                    and the threshold of concentration of cortical factor to control actin                    polymerization.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dynamical assembly and disassembly of intracellular actin filaments play important                roles in the shape change of eukaryotic cells and in their locomotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Pollard1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. For                cell motility being stimulated by the external chemical signals, molecular                mechanisms of regulatory dynamics of actin filaments have been intensively studied                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Parent1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Ueda1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since the ability of spontaneous cell movement should be a basis for chemotactic                responses, it is important to investigate the underlying mechanism. In this paper,                we develop a theoretical model of spatio-temporal dynamics of actin filaments to                reveal the mechanism of spontaneous behaviors.</p><p>In spontaneous movements, cells often take a &#x0201c;polypodal&#x0201d; shape by                extending several pseudopods as can be found in a variety of cell types including a                cellular slime mold <italic>Dictyostelium descoideum</italic> and macrophages in                vertebrates. Their polypodal shapes are termed amoeboid because they resemble large                water amoeba, <italic>Amoeba proteus</italic>                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Weber1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Some                other cells move spontaneously without taking the polypodal shape but by exhibiting                a &#x0201c;crescent&#x0201d; shape. Fish epidermal keratocytes are examples of                this type of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Lee1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> cells                lacking <italic>amiB</italic> gene take the keratocyte-like shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Asano1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,                suggesting that amoeboid and keratocyte-like types are altered to each other by a                minor change in biochemical reactions.</p><p>Variety of spontaneous movement is not limited to the above cases. In usual                cytokinesis of animal cells, a contractile ring of actin and myosin II divides a                cell into two daughter cells. <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> cells                lacking myosin II, however, exhibit a cell-cycle-coupled division without a                contractile ring through a process that two daughter cells crawl to opposite                directions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Neujahr1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Heizer1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Cell division with the contractile ring is called                &#x0201c;cytokinesis A&#x0201d; and cell division induced by the amoeboid                crawling movement without the contractile ring is called &#x0201c;cytokinesis                B&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Neujahr1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Uyeda1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, when the                large, multi-nucleate cells are put on a substrate, they form multiple leading                edges, which tear the cell into fragments in a manner uncoupled to the cell cycle                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Spudich1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.                Uyeda and his colleagues found that <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> cells                lacking not only myosin II but either AmiA or coronin exhibit this type of                cell-cycle-independent division, which was classified into &#x0201c;cytokinesis                C&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Uyeda1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Nagasaki1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Since such                cytofission is driven by the amoeboid crawling of cells, we may expect that the                unified mechanism underlies both spontaneous cell locomotion and cytofission.</p><p>There are a lot of ways to treat large deformation of cell shape mathematically. An                efficient way to reduce the computational cost is to consider only the boundary of a                cell body. St&#x000e9;phanou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Stphanou1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Stphanou2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> expressed a cell                boundary by introducing a two-dimensional polar coordinate system, based on the                two-phase model of Alt and his colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Alt1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In this method the                boundary of a two-dimensional cell was expressed by distance from a center point as                a function of angle. Satulovsky et al. also used a similar polar coordinate                expression based on the local-activator-global-inhibitor model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Satulovsky1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, but the polar                coordinate system cannot express shapes whose center is out of the boundary. Another                way of expressing cell boundary is to use the level set method (LSM), in which the                boundary of a cell is defined by a closed contour in a potential function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Yang1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Those                methods to consider only the boundary, however, are not convenient to consider                chemical reactions in cell body. In order to treat a whole cell body, one should                consider elastic or fluid mechanics of the continuous media. There are two ways to                describe the mechanics, Euler and Lagrange descriptions. With the Euler description,                chemicals in a cell and the cell shape are observed at locations fixed in space, but                with the Lagrange description, cell is tracked as a specific body. In many examples                of modeling, the Lagrange description has been adopted by treating cell as a                viscoelastic body. With the Lagrange description, Rubinstein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Rubinstein1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>                constructed a two-dimensional model of fish epidermal keratocyte, with which the                local density of actin and myosin within a cell was calculated to explain the                displacement vectors of cell. Immersed boundary methods (IBM) is a variation of                Lagrangian models with which the elastic bonds of actin filaments are treated                together with the fluid dynamical description of cell medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Bottino1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In the many-particle                model of Lenz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Lenz1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, elastic bonds in membrane were also considered.                Discrete models such as cellular automata, on the other hand, provide quite simple                methods, which can largely reduce the computational cost. For example, Satyanarayana                et al. developed a simple expression of cell shape, in which membrane was defined as                a &#x0201c;chain&#x0201d; on the lattice space and actin proteins were treated                as particles moving between lattice points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Satyanarayana1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In discrete                models, a cell body can be defined by a set of connected lattice points, with which                the use of Euler description is rather natural. For example, Mar&#x000e9;e et al.                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Mare1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>                explained keratocyte's locomotion by using a cellular Potts model (CPM)                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Glazier1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,                in which the volume of a cell body was controlled by an energy-like cost function.                Though those theoretical attempts explained important features of cell locomotion                and deformation, unified treatment of both cell locomotion and cytofission has not                yet been quantitatively discussed. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model to                propose hypothesis that a single mechanism underlies a variety of different modes of                movement, including amoeboid and keratocyte-type locomotion and cytokinesis B and                C-type fission.</p><p>A unified description of cell locomotion and cytofission dates back to the review                paper of Bray and White on cortical flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Bray1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>: At the front edge of                moving cell, actin is actively polymerized into the branched network and various                protein factors such as Arp2/3 or uncapping proteins, which activate actin                polymerization, are accumulated. Apart from the front edge, polymerization of actin                network is somehow inhibited by accumulation of other protein factors, so that actin                filaments remain to form skeletal structure at the cortical layer of cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Pollard1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. As                cell moves forward, this cortical actin is sent to the rear of cell in a manner                similar to the flow of a caterpillar track and is dissolved into cytosol at the rear                edge of cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000310-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Such a                concerted flow of cortical actin has been called &#x0201c;cortical flow&#x0201d;                and proteins which interact with actin filaments should be transported to the rear                by this cortical flow. In the case of cytofission, the cortical flow runs from the                front to the equator of cell and there cortical actin is dissolved into cytosol.                Bray and White pointed out that cortical flow should play decisive roles not only in                amoeboid locomotion but also in cytofission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Bray1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This cortical flow                should give rise to the inhomogeneous distributions of bundled actin in the cortical                layer and proteins that can interact with this cortical actin. When cell moves on a                substratum, the bottom side of cell adheres to the substratum, so that the freely                running cortical flow is absent on the bottom side. Even in such a case, cell                movement should bring about the inhomogeneous distribution of cortical actin and                other proteins as was suggested by Bray and White <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Bray1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, and we here focus on                such inhomogeneous distributions of proteins as a basis of unified description of                locomotion and cytofission.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000310-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000310.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The model of cell movement.</title><p>(a) A schematic view of dynamics of cortex layer.

In order to treat such large scale                    cell deformation, computational efficiency is an important requirement. Such                    efficiency is fulfilled by coarse-graining variables to be calculated. Since we                    need to coarse-grain dynamical rules among those variables, we do not consider                    here the detailed balance among mechanical forces explicitly but instead, we                    adopt the simplified kinetic rules of reactions and cell deformation.</p><p>Our coarse-grained description is based on the model of cell polarization. When                    cell is guided by the gradient of chemoattractant, cell is polarized upon                    receiving the chemoattractant molecules at the cell surface: Receptors at the                    cell surface initiate a cascade of events by stimulating the intracellular                    signaling molecules, which leads to a distinctive localization of signaling                    molecules in a polarized manner in a cell. These signaling events finally                    activate regulators such as Arp2/3 complex, which then stimulates the nucleation                    for actin polymerization. Growth of the actin filament network induces                    protrusion of the leading edge, which pulls the cell body forward. In this way,                    accumulated at the front side of cell are the branched actin network, Arp2/3                    complex, proteins which uncap the barbed end of actin filaments, and other                    regulatory proteins to enhance polymerization of actin filament <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Pollard2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.                    At the rear side of cell, on the other hand, actin filaments are bundled to form                    skeletal structures. Myosin II is accumulated at the rear and the actin-myosin                    complex generates the mechanical force to retract the rear of cell. Thus, at the                    rear side of cell, cortical actin, capped ends of actin, myosin II, and other                    regulatory proteins are accumulated and collectively work to inhibit formation                    of a branched actin network and the actin nucleation sites. This polarization                    stabilizes the directional motion of the cell to ascend the gradient of                    chemoattractant.</p><p>In the case there is no external chemical guidance, the spontaneous movement                    should be stabilized by a similar but spontaneously formed polarization of                    cells. In fact, many regulatory components for cell locomotion are localized                    spontaneously in a polarized manner along the length of a moving cell under no                    external cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Wessels1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. To describe such stable polarization, we                    focus on protein factors which are accumulated at the rear and call them                    &#x0201c;cortical factors&#x0201d;. Among cortical factors we include                    proteins that inhibit formation of branched actin network and interact with                    cortical actin, and cortical actin itself. When cell moves forward, these                    cortical factors are diluted at the front and accumulated at the rear of cell.                    In the present coarse-grained model, cortical factors are collectively                    represented by a single variable. Although more precise descriptions of multiple                    variables which are accumulated at the rear should improve the model, we use a                    variable of cortical factor to represent the feedback effects in an efficient                    way in the present model.</p><p>We assume a flat substratum and a flat cellular membrane by neglecting the height                    from the surface, which leads to the two-dimensional model of cell. Cell is                    modeled on the two-dimensional plane that consists of discrete hexagonal sites.                    A cell is defined by a set of connected sites in this space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000310-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). We call those                    sites &#x0201c;cortical sites&#x0201d;, whereas other non-cellular sites are                    &#x0201c;external sites&#x0201d;. Cortical sites which are adjacent to at                    least one of external sites are called &#x0201c;membrane sites&#x0201d;.                    Cortical sites represent the side of cell that attaches to a substratum via                    adhesive molecules although we do not treat those molecules explicitly. In this                    model, the cell does not slide on the substratum but proceeds by creation of new                    adhesive bonds at the front and detachment at the rear of cell.</p><p>We assume that each cortical site can have two chemical species: Branched network                    of filamentous actin and the cortical factor, local concentrations of which are                    indicated by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e003.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e004.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, respectively, where the suffix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e005.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> specifies the site position.

Such                        a global constraint on the whole cell size should be a natural consequence                        of approximately constant mass of cell and has been indeed observed in                        experiments of Karen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Keren1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this way, the term <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e061.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> in the cost function is reasonable at least in the first                        order approximation. Resting cells, on the other hand, often exhibit rounded                        shapes because of their cortical tension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Dai1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000310.s001">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000310.s002">S2</xref>. We                    refer to the locomotion shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000310-g002">Figure 2</xref> as the amoeboid-like locomotion and the one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000310-g003">Figure 3</xref> as the                    keratocyte-like locomotion. In both two types, concentration of the cortical                    factor is lower at around the front of moving cell and higher at around the                    rear. This inhomogeneity can be explained by the feedback mechanism which we                    call the <italic>cortical feedback mechanism</italic>: As cell starts to move in                    a direction, addition of cortical sites at the front dilutes the cortical factor                    and removal of cortical sites at the rear concentrates the cortical factor. Thus                    generated inhomogeneity of distribution of the cortical factor prevents the cell                    from moving backward and further stabilizes the forwarding motion. In this way,                    once cell starts to move in a direction, the cell tends to keep moving in that                    direction for a while through this positive feedback of motion and reaction.</p><p>Difference between two types of locomotion is the degree of fluctuation: The                    simulated amoeboid-like locomotion is much more fluctuating than the simulated                    keratocyte-like locomotion. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000310-g002">Figure 2</xref>, shape of the amoeboid-like cell                    dramatically changes between the long polarized shape and the rounded shape. In                    contrast, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000310-g003">Figure                    3</xref>, the keratocyte-like cell keeps a laterally long shape. This difference                    in fluctuation is similar to the observed difference between the wildtype                        <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> cells and the keratocyte-like                    AmiB-null mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Asano1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In amoeboid-like locomotion, the threshold of actin polymerization, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e132.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, is small but the rate of actin polymerization, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e133.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, is large, which leads to the rapid actin polymerization in a                    localized region in the cell. Once the local region happens to have a large                    enough <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e134.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, then that part protrudes to lead the cell body. The cortical                    factor is diluted at that protruding region and is concentrated at the opposite                    side of the cell (see 250 s in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000310-g002">Figure 2a</xref>), which further enhances the protrusion at the front and                    contraction at the rear. In this way, the cell shape is elongated and the                    directed cell movement is stabilized through the cortical feedback. However,                    since diffusion of cortical factor is comparable with the speed of cell                    movement, the region where the cortical factor is diluted is not instantly                    filled by the diffusing cortical factor but is kept diluted behind the moving                    tip of cell after the movement lasts for a certain duration. Then, concentration                    of the cortical factor can be smaller than the threshold in this spread region                    and the actin network begins to be formed. Actin polymerization in this somewhat                    wide region promotes the protrusion around this area, which makes the cell shape                    round and the cell movement is slowed down. Then, the cortical factor is diluted                    at every protruding front, which further widens the region of small                    concentration of the cortical factor (325 s of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000310-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). At this stage of the rounded                    cell, if some localized region happens to have large <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e135.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> in its fluctuation, the cell begins to move in that direction,                    then the positive cortical feedback leads to the elongated shape again (at 375                    s). In this way, coupled oscillations of cell shape, speed of movement, and the                    cortical factor distribution are inevitable in amoeboid-like locomotion as a                    consequence of the cortical feedback mechanism. In keratocyte-like locomotion,                    on the other hand, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e136.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is large and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e137.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is small. Then, actin is polymerized in a wide area with a                    moderate speed, which forms a stable laterally-long moving front of the cell.                    Through cell deformation, the cortical factor is diluted in this wide spread                    region and is accumulated in the rear side of the cell. This coupled pattern of                    motion and the cortical factor distribution is stable enough to keep the                    direction of cell movement through the cortical feedback mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Statistical Analysis of Cell Locomotion</title><p>Differences between two types of locomotion can be quantified by measuring                    several statistical quantities.

Although our model does                    not treat cell cycle, we found that these phenomena are morphologically similar                    to cell division.

The probability of occurrence of the cytokinesis B-like pattern                    is highest in the middle of this region at which the cell has both                    characteristics of the amoeboid-like movement and the keratocyte-like movement                    and can not stay in one of these two locomotive states to show the cell-division                    like instability.</p><p>The cytokinesis C-like pattern as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000310-g007">Figure 7</xref> appears when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e204.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is set to (4.5,4.5).

This behavior is quite similar to the observed cytokinesis C                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Nagasaki1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-httpjcs.biologists.orgcgicontentfull115102241DC11">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In the model, enlargement of erosion is                    accelerated by accumulation of the cortical factor at the erosive front.                    Contraction at the erosive part concentrates the cortical factor there through                    the cortical feedback mechanism, that further promotes the erosion.

This ability of the model indicates that the cortical feedback                mechanism, i.e. the motion-reaction feedback mechanism is the unified mechanism                underlying a variety of patterns of spontaneous cell movement. This positive                feedback stabilizes the straight movement in keratocyte-like locomotion, induces the                oscillatory dynamics in amoeboid-like locomotion and destabilizes a single cell to                split into multiple domains via cytokinesis B or C-like movement. Different modes of                movements can be explained as variations in parameters that control the threshold                and the rate constant of actin polymerization. Effects of modulation of the                threshold should be experimentally tested by controlling the number of nucleation                sites of actin polymerization in cell. Effects of modulation of the rate constant                should be tested by regulating the concentration or affinity of proteins such as                profilin, which binds to G actin to control the speed of actin polymerization.</p><p>Together with our model, biochemical and genetic evidence in regulatory mechanisms of                actin polymerization may suggest a molecular basis for cortical factors. In the                model, we referred to a collection of proteins which have an inhibitory role in                actin polymerization as cortical factors. Then the model suggested that functional                defects in cortical factors enhance formation of lateral pseudopods leading to                destabilization of cellular polarity and motile persistency. In                    <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells, a series of mutant cell lines have been                subjected to characterization of cell shape and motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Wessels1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. A subset of mutants,                including the null mutants of myosin II, clathrin, sphingosin-1-phosphate lyase, and                PTEN, exhibit behavioral defects in which the mutant cells form a pseudopod more                frequently from the lateral regions than the wild type and exhibit locomotion with                less persistency, suggesting that these molecules are involved in the suppression of                lateral pseudopods in a polarized cell. Some of them, <italic>e.g.</italic> myosin                II and PTEN, may be cortical factors because those molecules are highly localized at                the rear of a polarized <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cell and around the                equatorial regions of the dividing cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Yumura1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Janetopoulos1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Accumulation of                myosin II at the rear has been also reported in other cell types. Verkhovsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Verkhovsky1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,                for example, showed the accumulation of myosin II at the rear of moving fragments of                a fish epidermal keratocyte cell. In Verkhovsky's experiment, cell movement                was induced by the mechanical pushing at the initial moment, which strongly suggests                that the accumulation of myosin II is not due to the chemical signaling but is                induced by the cell shape deformation. The fact that myosin II acts as an actin                depolymerization agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Haviv1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> also supports the idea that myosin II functions                as a cortical factor. Since other regulatory proteins or cortical actin structure                itself may also work as cortical factors, deletion of myosin II in mutants does not                lead to the complete deletion of cortical factors but should alter the functionality                of cortical factors, which can be reflected in the larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e210.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> in the model. Cytokinesis C-like movement explained by a large <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e211.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> in the model is consistent with the observed cytofission in myosin                II-null <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>.</p><p>Another mechanism which can explain a variety of patterns of cell movement is the                local-activator-global-inhibitor mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Satulovsky1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. This mechanism may                coexist with the cortical factor feedback mechanism of the present paper, but we                should stress that cortical factors can dynamically change their distribution                through change in cell shape or environment, so that the dynamical response of cell                should be more appropriately explained by the cortical factor feedback mechanism. A                similar mechanism of dynamical response was also discussed in the protocell model of                Suzuki and Ikegami <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Cell shape dynamics should be determined by integrating balance of mechanical forces                and chemical reactions at each local part of cell. In the present discretized model,                integration of such local balance was not explicitly pursued but was replaced by                many trials of updating sites under the Metropolis-like judgment. The cost function                used in the judgment represents the constraint to keep the global cell size by                making the peripheral length of cell small. A similar global constraint was                successfully used in the model of Mar&#x000e9;e et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Mare1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and the constraint was                indeed observed in the experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Keren1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Checking the robustness                of simulated results against detailed changes of the constraint would further                provide an evidence for the soundness of the constraint introduced in the model. We                repeated simulations by changing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e212.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e213.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> to examine this robustness. Increase in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e214.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> generates more rounded cell shapes in simulation, leading to the                increase in the minimum value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000310.e215.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.

Various modes of movement such as aggregation of <italic>Dictyostelium                discoideum</italic> cells exhibiting an elongated shape were not treated in this                paper but should be explained when the chemotaxis is taken into account in the                model. In an immobile cell under the influence of external chemical cues, existence                of the internal gradients of PI3K, PTEN, PIP3, and other proteins has been observed                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000310-Parent2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>,                which suggests that the intracellular chemical signaling works independently of                whether the cell is moving or not. The cortical feedback, on the other hand, works                through the cell movement. Interplay between the chemical signaling and the cortical                feedback should further explain the complex behavior of cells induced by the                external cues.</p></sec><sec
