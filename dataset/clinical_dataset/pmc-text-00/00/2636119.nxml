It is possible to elicit the duration only by history-taking, as the subjective method is likely to be inaccurate.The authors have not mentioned the details of this findingin the article. If the duration of macular detachment wasrecorded, a correlation with the location of break, and post-operative visual gain should have been expressed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The authors state that after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) was injected and immediatelyPFCL-air exchange was done, and endolaser was appliedunder air. This means that retina could flatten under air only.Why was then PFCL injected initially? Fluid-air exchangewith endo drainage would have been enough. Use of PFCLwas superfluous and if this was done, endolaser could havebeen applied under PFCL as it gives better visualizationthan air, closer approximation of neurosensory retina andretina pigment epithelium, making it possible to use lowlaser power.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Authors have mentioned the number of retinal breaks, andthe size of retinal detachment in Table 1 of their article, butnot the location. Only gas tamponade has been used andinferior breaks are not likely to close with gas tamponade andposture alone. Were all the breaks superior in location?</p></list-item><list-item><p>The authors mention the use of sodium hyaluronate 1%to fill up anterior chamber to prevent passage of air inanterior chamber. Air can come to anterior chamber onlyif posterior capsule has a break and in such a situation,viscoelastic also cannot prevent it. Viscoelastic is injectedin anterior chamber and will lie on the surface of IOLand the surrounding intact posterior capsule. Opening inposterior capsule is generally under IOL and will not beblocked by viscoelastic. Air enters the eye under pressureand will always move up, while viscoelastic will settledown with gravity. It is difficult to accept that viscoelasticwill prevent the entry of air in anterior chamber, exceptwhen there is tight fill of viscoelastic in anterior chambercreating high positive pressure to keep the air pushed back.This will mean injection of a large amount of viscoelasticin anterior chamber. The authors have not mentioned theamount injected by them. The authors state that a proneposture was maintained for five days. This as such willkeep the gas/air back, leaving viscoelastic in the anteriorchamber; this appears unnecessary and can give rise tocomplications.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The authors state &#x02032;increased patient comfort &#x02032;is anadvantage of this procedure, while they mention to keepprone posture for five days. In case of superior breaks andPPV with sutures, prone posture is not needed; rather anerect or a chin-down posture is needed, and there is norisk of gas leak as the sclerotomies are closed. Have theymaintained a prone posture to prevent leakage of gas asthe sclerotomies were not sutured? It is contrary to theirclaim of patient comfort or they have done so to take careof inferior breaks? In that case, they have not given anydetails of location of breaks, which to our mind is the mostimportant information about a case of retinal detachment?In any case, inferior breaks will require a buckle.</p></list-item></list></p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Horozoglu</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Yanyali</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Celik</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Aytug</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Nohutcu</surname><given-names>AF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Primary 25-guage transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy in pseudophakic retinal detachment.</article-title><source>Indian J Ophthalmol</source><year>2007</year><volume>55</volume><fpage>337</fpage><lpage>40</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17699941</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
