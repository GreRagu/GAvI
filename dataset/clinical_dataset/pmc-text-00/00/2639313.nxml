A total of 375 subjects&#x02014;335 with CKD and 40 with essential hypertension&#x02014;were included. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to detect SBI. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation, and cardiovascular risk factors were examined.</p><p><bold>Results.</bold> The prevalence of SBI was 56.5% in all subjects. Among causes of CKD, hypertensive nephrosclerosis had a strong association with SBI. According to the estimated GFR (eGFR) stage, the more severe the stage of eGFR, the higher the prevalence of SBI (age-adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] for eGFR 30&#x02013;59, 15&#x02013;29 and &#x0003c;15 versus &#x02265;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>: 1.34 [0.68&#x02013;1.99], 1.94 [1.30&#x02013;2.57] and 2.51 [1.91&#x02013;3.10]).

In most cases, SBI is found as a lacunar infarction that is a small, deep cerebral infarction caused by occlusion of small penetrating cerebral arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Therefore, SBI is categorized as small vessel disease and thus differs from other cardiovascular disease, such as ischaemic heart disease (IHD), aortic dissection and atherothrombotic cerebral infarction, because they are categorized as large vessel disease. SBI is seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) both in patients with an overt stroke and in healthy elderly persons. It has been reported that the prevalence of SBI in the general population was from 8% to 28%, with the differences mainly explained by age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The presence of SBI can predict clinical overt stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3 R4">3,4</xref>] or reduced cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5 R6">5,6</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that risk factors for SBI are not necessarily the same as those for clinical stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>], and several studies have consistently found that advanced age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3 R4">3,4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8 R9">8,9</xref>] and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] are the most common risk factors for SBI.</p><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been shown to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11 R12">10&#x02013;12</xref>], and cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in CKD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13 R14">13,14</xref>]. Similarly, several reports have indicated that CKD is associated with a high prevalence of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11">10,11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15 R16 R17 R18 R19">15&#x02013;19</xref>]. However, the association between CKD and SBI has not been clarified, and little is known about what factors are related to SBI in CKD patients.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence and risk factors of SBI in CKD patients with a wide range of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and to examine the strength of association between the prevalence of SBI and GFR stages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>To determine the implications of CKD for the prevalence of SBI, we examined 335 elderly patients with CKD (stages 1&#x02013;5) and 40 elderly patients with essential hypertension (EHT). A total of 375 subjects were enrolled, and all subjects attended the Department of Internal Medicine of Yokohama City University Medical Center, Japan, between August 2004 and October 2007. Exclusion criteria were subjects having a past history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) or having a past history of RRT and not in agreement with our study.</p><p>GFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, as follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="gfn419ueq1.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p>CKD was defined as either kidney damage or eGFR &#x0003c;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> for 3 or more months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. Kidney damage was defined as pathologic abnormalities or markers of damage, including abnormalities in blood or urine tests or imaging studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. CKD staging was based on eGFR. We classified eGFR into the following ranges: &#x02265;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (stage 1 or 2), 30&#x02013;59 mL/min/ 1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup> (stage 3), 15&#x02013;29 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (stage 4) and &#x0003c;15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (stage 5), according to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. All subjects with EHT had no kidney damage as described above, and their eGFR were not &#x0003c;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>The ethical committee of Yokohama City University Medical Center approved the protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Silent brain infarction</title><p>All subjects underwent MRI of the brain. We performed axial T1-, T2- and proton-density-weighted scans on 1.5-T MRI scanners (Siemens AVANTO, Germany). The slice thickness was 6 mm with an interslice gap of 1.5 mm. We defined SBI as a focal area &#x02265;3 mm and &#x0003c;20 mm in diameter in both T1- and T2-weighted scans that was visible as a low-intensity area on the T1-weighted image and as a high-intensity area on the T2-weighted image. Proton-density scans were used to distinguish infarctions from dilated perivascular spaces. Two trained physicians who had not been notified of any clinical information assessed the MR images independently. Their evaluation had an inter-reader intraclass correlation of 0.99.</p><p>We determined history of stroke and TIA by self-reporting, and by checking the medical records of all subjects, independent of their MRI outcome. We defined SBI as evidence on MRI of one or more infarctions, without a history of a stroke or TIA.</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Risk factors</title><p>At the baseline examination, each subject completed a self-administered questionnaire covering their medical history, drugs received at least over the last year, smoking habit and alcohol intake. Trained interviewers at the screening checked the questionnaire, and the study physicians performed a physical examination of each subject and rechecked their medical history to improve the accuracy of the information.</p><p>Smoking habit was classified as current, past and never. With smokers, the Brinkmann index (cigarettes &#x000d7; year) was calculated. Alcohol intake was converted to grams of ethanol per day. We checked history of IHD, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. IHD was defined as either angina, history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Diabetes mellitus was defined according to the criteria recommended by the American Diabetes Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], in addition to a medical history of diabetes mellitus. Hypertension was diagnosed when blood pressure (BP) was &#x02265;140/90 mmHg or patients were receiving antihypertensive treatments. BP was measured at least three times, after 5 min of rest, by trained observers using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer with the subject in the sitting position. The mean data were used for analysis.</p><p>Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast for the determination of serum creatinine, haemoglobin, fibrinogen, total protein, albumin, triglycerides, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), calcium concentration, phosphate concentration, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). These specimens were assayed within 1 h. Serum creatinine concentration was measured by an enzymatic method. Serum calcium concentration was corrected for the serum albumin concentration, and the calcium&#x02013;phosphate product was calculated. PTH measurements were based on an intact molecule assay. Proteinuria (g/day) was checked by collecting 24-h urine in CKD patients.</p></sec><sec id="S2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The SAS software package was used to perform all statistical analyses. All data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD. eGFR was classified into four categories, and baseline characteristics were compared among eGFR categories. The mean values of selected conditions were examined using chi-squared statistics for categorical variables and one-way ANOVA of variance for continuous variables. Differences in the prevalence of SBI between eGFR categories, causes of CKD and nature of antihypertensive drugs were tested by logistic regression analysis. Age- or multivariable-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were also estimated by the use of multiple logistic regression analysis. Differences between the two groups, patients with SBI and those without, were analysed by means of unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. Chi-squared test was used to calculate the <italic>P</italic>-value for categorical variables. Variables associated with SBI in univariable analysis were entered into a multivariable model using logistic regression methods to determine the power of each variable for predicting SBI. We performed multilinear regression analysis of factors related to the number of SBI. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S3"><title>Results</title><p>Clinical and demographic details of our study are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics by the eGFR category</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="5" align="left" rowspan="1">Estimated GFR (mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>)</th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Overall</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02265;60</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30&#x02013;59</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15&#x02013;29</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;15</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic>-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of patients</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">375</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">101</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">76</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">84</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">114</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of patients with SBI</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">212</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">38</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">43</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">53</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">78</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Men (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">45.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;0.001</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (year)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.5 &#x000b1;

Other traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as male sex, alcohol intake and diabetes mellitus, were not different in the two groups. In this study, we also investigated the relationships between SBI and non-traditional risk factors, such as proteinuria, anaemia, fibrinogen, albumin, hs-CRP and mineral metabolism of calcium and phosphate. Among these factors, only haemoglobin was different in the two groups; however, the difference was not significant after adjustment for eGFR. In relation to mineral metabolism of calcium and phosphate, we also investigated the association between SBI and the use of vitamin D (alfacalcidol and calcitriol) by comparing the prevalence ratio of these drugs between the two groups, but found no difference. Multivariable logistic analysis of factors that had a statistically significant relationship with SBI by univariable analysis revealed that eGFR had a graded association with the prevalence of SBI, in addition to age and sBP (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Characteristics of patients with and without SBI</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">With SBI</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Without SBI</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic>-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of patients</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">212</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">163</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Men (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.0</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NS</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (year)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.7 &#x000b1;

For each drug, we found no association with SBI. However, we found the following association by focusing on angiotensin (AT) II formation of each drug. We divided the patients receiving antihypertensive treatments into two groups: those receiving only drugs potentially increasing AT II (AT II type I receptor antagonists, diuretics and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists) and those receiving both drugs potentially increasing AT II and drugs potentially decreasing AT II (AT-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and long-acting non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists).

However, little information has been available on the relationship between kidney and brain compared to kidney and heart. In cerebral disease, SBI is asymptomatic, but is important as a predictor of stroke and dementia. To prevent these disorders and keep a good quality of life, the control of risk factors for SBI is necessary. In this regard, our report, showing the association between CKD and SBI, would be meaningful.</p><p>There are two types of cerebral small vessel disease: SBI and white matter lesions (WML). Recently, it has been shown that eGFR was associated with WML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23 R24">23,24</xref>]. However, the association between SBI and eGFR has not been clarified. Ikram <italic>et al</italic>. showed that there was no significant association between SBI and eGFR, despite showing a significant association between WML and eGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. However, the prevalence in severe stage CKD patients has not been sufficiently examined, and uraemia-related factors were not fully analysed because the study population had relatively good renal function (mean eGFR 54.8 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). On the other side, in patients with more severe CKD, Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the prevalence of SBI in patients with creatinine clearance (CCr) &#x0003c;40 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> was significantly higher than that in those with CCr &#x02265;40 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 51) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. However, their results were not adjusted for age and BP. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the high prevalence of SBI in CKD patients depends on age and/or BP, which are common strong risk factors for SBI and increase as eGFR declines, or whether other uraemia-related factors play a role in SBI in CKD patients. In addition, their sample was too small to reach a conclusion on the relationship between CKD and SBI, and patients with diabetes mellitus, which is a major cause of CKD, were excluded from their study.</p><p>In the present study, we confirmed that BP and age were related to SBI in CKD patients, similar to the general population. Moreover, we revealed that eGFR was also associated with SBI independent of age and BP. In addition, we analysed and compared all-cause CKD patients to show the prevalence of SBI in each group of CKD patients and revealed that patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis had a higher prevalence of SBI. It has been clarified that the prevalence of cardiac disease increases as the eGFR stage progresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11 R12">10&#x02013;12</xref>]. We showed that this association is also applied to SBI. These findings may indicate that there is a cerebro-renal association, similar to the cardio-renal association.</p><p>Yamamoto <italic>et al</italic>. showed that patients with multiple lacunar infarctions had a higher risk for cardiovascular disease than patients with a single lacunar infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Another group showed that the number of lacunae was related to the degree of brain atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. Therefore, we also performed analysis of the relationship between the number of SBI and eGFR. The results revealed that a decline of eGFR was associated with not only the prevalence of SBI but also the number of SBI independently.</p><p>Furthermore, we investigated the cause of the high prevalence of SBI in CKD patients. Reduced kidney function is associated with increased levels of inflammatory factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28 R29">28,29</xref>], enhanced coagulability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], anaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>] and calcium&#x02013;phosphate abnormality. Moreover, CKD patients often have proteinuria. Thus, we investigated these non-traditional factors: hs-CRP, albumin, fibrinogen, haemoglobin, mineral metabolism of calcium and phosphate and proteinuria. However, we could not find any influence of these factors on the prevalence of SBI. These results suggest that these factors do not play a major role in SBI alone and other non-traditional factors or the combination of multiple non-traditional risk factors affect the prevalence of SBI in CKD patients. However, more studies are needed to clarify why eGFR associates with SBI independently. For traditional factors, it has been cleared that smoking, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for stroke in addition to advanced age and hypertension, and CKD patients often share these risk factors. Although no relationship was seen between these factors and SBI in our study, the strict control of multiple cardiovascular risk factors including these factors may be necessary in CKD patients to prevent cerebral dysfunction.</p><p>Meanwhile, hypertension and sBP associated with SBI very strongly in CKD patients. We investigated the prevalence of SBI, categorized by eGFR and sBP. The results revealed that not only the prevalence of SBI increased as the eGFR category worsened, but also the prevalence of SBI was markedly lower in patients whose hypertension was appropriately treated. In addition, patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis had higher prevalence of SBI than those with other causes of CKD. This indicates that there is a link between vascular disease of the kidney and brain, and hypertension is important as a cause of the high prevalence of SBI in CKD patients. Blood vessels in the kidney and brain were reported to be highly susceptible to fluctuations in BP and flow because the vascular beds of both the kidney and brain have very low resistance and are passively perfused at high flow throughout systole and diastole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. Interestingly, this mechanism is present only in the kidney and brain, and it causes small-vessel injury in these organs. Therefore, BP control may be especially important to prevent small-vessel disease of the kidney and brain in CKD patients, and our results support this report.</p><p>We also considered whether the prevalence of SBI was different in the nature of antihypertensive treatments. Experimental data in rodents have documented that activation of AT<sub>2</sub> receptor of AT II may exert anti-ischaemic mechanisms in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32 R33 R34 R35">32&#x02013;35</xref>]. In addition, the meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials have hypothesized that drugs increasing AT II are more stroke protective than drugs decreasing AT II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. In our study, most patients were treated with combined antihypertensive drugs. Furthermore, most of them received at least one of the drugs potentially increasing AT II. Thus, we analysed the association between SBI and AT II formation by dividing patients receiving antihypertensive treatments into two groups: those receiving only drugs potentially increasing AT II and those receiving both drugs potentially increasing AT II and drugs potentially decreasing AT II. By using multivariable logistic regression analysis, we showed that the prevalence of SBI in the latter was statistically higher than that in the former even after adjustment for factors that were associated with SBI independently in our study. Our results may support the hypothesis that drugs increasing AT II have a protective effect on brain ischaemia.</p><p>However, our study has several limitations. Firstly, it was cross-sectional, and therefore, a prospective study concerning the development of SBI may warrant the results. Secondly, we chose EHT patients as controls to consider whether eGFR associated with SBI independently, because most CKD patients had hypertension, which was a strong risk factor for SBI. Thus, we did not adopt the age-matched healthy subjects in the present study. However, it is an important and interesting point to gather and compare CKD patients to the age-matched healthy volunteer. We would like to reveal this problem in the future study. Finally, GFR was estimated by the MDRD equation. The equation we used is widely accepted. However, it may not be accurate across racial groups because of difference among races in creatinine generation. In order to compensate the MDRD equation, we re-analysed our data using the MDRD equation modified for Japanese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>] and the Cockcroft&#x02013;Gault equation for CCr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>] and confirmed that the results were the same as those using the MDRD equation (data not shown). This reproducibility would guarantee the results of our study.</p><p>Despite these limitations, we described the graded association between eGFR and SBI in patients with a wide range of eGFR and reported the prevalence of SBI according to eGFR stage and cause of CKD. Moreover, we showed the importance of CKD as a predictor not only of SBI but also of the number of SBI.</p><p>In conclusion, CKD associates with SBI independently. Furthermore, the prevalence of SBI and the number of SBI increased markedly as eGFR decreased. Our findings suggest that CKD patients should be considered as a high-risk population for SBI, which is a risk for stroke and dementia, and be recommended for more intensive preventive management, including active detection of SBI and strict treatment of multiple cardiovascular risk factors, especially hypertension.</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement.</italic> None declared.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vermeer</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Longstreth</surname><given-names>WT</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Koudstaal</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Silent brain infarcts: a systematic review</article-title><source>Lancet Neurol</source><year>2007</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>611</fpage><lpage>619</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17582361</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Lacunar strokes and infarcts: a review</article-title><source>Neurology</source><year>1982</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>871</fpage><lpage>876</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7048128</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="R3"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagenknecht</surname><given-names>LE</given-names></name><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Cigarette smoking and other risk factors for silent cerebral infarction in the general population</article-title><source>Stroke</source><year>1998</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>913</fpage><lpage>917</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9596234</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="R4"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kobayashi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Okada</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Koide</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Subcortical silent brain infarction as a risk factor for clinical stroke</article-title><source>Stroke</source><year>1997</year><volume>28</volume><fpage>1932</fpage><lpage>1939</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9341698</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="R5"><label>5</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Price</surname><given-names>TR</given-names></name><name><surname>Manolio</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name><name><surname>Kronmal</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><collab>The Cardiovascular Health Study.
