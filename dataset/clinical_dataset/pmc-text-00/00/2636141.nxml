Dry eye in HIV infection isdue to decreased tear production associated with diminishedlactoferrin and lysozyme and is of mild to moderate severityand can be treated with artificial tears.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> A detailed searchon MEDLINE of previously recorded literature of ocularmanifestation of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)did not reveal keratomalacia as the initial presenting featureof HIV/AIDS.</p><sec sec-type=""><title>Case Report</title><p>A 50-year-old male reported to the ophthalmic outpatientdepartment (OPD) with complaints of inability to see with theleft eye for the past three months and with the right eye for thepast one month. Onset was associated with pricking sensationin each eye. He gave history of difficulty in seeing after sunsetfor the past few years.</p><p>He gave history of chronic diarrhea, especially followingmeals, associated with marked weight loss for the past fouryears. He was not a known diabetic. He denied history of oculartrauma, fever, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, breathlessnessor any systemic medication.</p><p>Patient belonged to poor socioeconomic strata and his dietconsisted of only rice with occasional curry. He denied historyof alcohol or tobacco abuse. On general examination he wasmarkedly emaciated, weighing only 44 kg [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The vitalparameters were stable. The skin was ichthyotic. The hair overthe body was sparse and coarse. There was marked pallor,koilonychia and generalized lymphadenopathy. There wasno edema, oral thrush or oral hairy leukoplakia. Abdominalexamination revealed hepatosplenomegaly. The respiratory,cardiovascular and central nervous systems were essentiallynormal.</p><p>Patient had severe photophobia. There was bilateralmadarosis with tylosis [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. He had minimal circumcornealcongestion. There was dry keratinization of the palpebralconjunctiva with a corrugated appearance akin to skin. Therewere Bitot&#x02032;s spots at the temporal limbus with marked xerosis.The visual acuity was reduced in each eye to perception of lightwith accurate projection of rays.</p><p>The cornea of the right eye was reduced to a thinopaque membrane seen in parts only and was covered withmucopurulent strands. There was a gutter involving thewhole of the limbus. The anterior chamber was flat with irisvisible in areas of absent cornea. The entire iridocorneal masswas protuberant with a whitish/pinkish-appearing patch inthe center [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>]. The intraocular pressure could not beassessed.</p><p>The cornea of the left eye was shrunken to about 6 mmin diameter, opaque, thinned out and flattened with nasalvascularization. The anterior chamber was flat with iris seenadherent to the cornea. Rest of the details of the anterior chambercould not be made out [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. The eye was hypotonous.</p><p>Patient was provisionally diagnosed as keratomalacia righteye and atrophic bulbi with xerophthalmia left eye. He wasevaluated to determine any contributory causes for loss ofweight and chronic diarrhea.</p><p>Investigations revealed hemoglobin 9.8 gm/dl. Blood sugar,serum electrolytes, stool examination, renal and liver functiontests and chest X-ray were normal. HbsAg and C-reactiveprotein were negative, electrocardiogram showed sinusbradycardia and abdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly.enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HIV waspositive.</p><p>He was given intramuscular injection of vitamin A 200,000IU on the day of admission, the next day and then after oneweek. In addition he was treated with topical antibiotics andartificial tears. Within a week of the treatment there was areversal of all changes of conjunctival xerosis and keratinizationand the conjunctiva became pink and velvety [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>].However, there was no change in the corneal condition. Thepatient sought discharge against medical advice despite beingadvised about his condition.</p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Discussion</title><p>AIDS caused by HIV is characterized by the deficiency of Thelper (CD4) lymphocytes, leading to an inability to combatopportunistic infections.</p><p>A provisional diagnosis of AIDS was made based on theworld health organization criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> which, was subsequentlyconfirmed in accordance with the National Aids ControlOrganization guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Besides two major features, weightloss and chronic diarrhea, and one minor feature in the formof generalized lymphadenopathy, the patient was serologicallypositive too, established by positive ELISA.</p><p>He presented with xerophthalmia X3B. The diagnosis ofkeratomalacia was based on the findings of a melted corneain a relatively quiet eye associated with clinical features ofxerophthalmia with reversal of the conjunctival signs onparenteral vitamin A therapy. The patient could not affordserum retinol levels and CD4 cell count or plasma viral loadestimation.</p><p>Vitamin A deficiency is the direct cause of xerophthalmia.Hypovitaminosis A is well documented in children, especiallyfollowing severe measles where vitamin A stores are rapidlydepleted due to increased metabolism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Active cornealxerophthalmia is extremely rare in older children and adults,except in severe famines. They are a medical emergencyand require urgent treatment by high-dose vitamin Asupplementation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Retinol deficiency is quite frequent in thepopulation of HIV-infected individuals. Serum retinol levels ofless than 1.05 micromol/L determine a 3.5 to five times higherdeath risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> The recommended treatment for HIV-positiveindividuals is similar to their HIV-negative peers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p><p>Liang <italic>et al</italic>., have found that hypovitaminosis A, E,and B<sub>12</sub> accelerated the development of AIDS, whereastheir normalization retarded the development of immunedysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p><p>In Ethiopia, vitamin A deficiency is recognized as a seriouspublic health problem among patients with chronic diarrhea,with or without HIV infection. Vitamin A deficiency (VAD,serum retinol &#x0003c;0.70 micromol/L) was observed in 52.7% and45.5% of diarrheic patients with and without HIV co-infection,respectively. About 13% of healthy controls and 29.3% ofasymptomatic HIV-infected blood donors were deficient invitamin A.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></p><p>Though hypovitaminosis A is well documented in patientswith HIV infection and is aggravated by the associateddiarrhea, keratomalacia as presenting ocular manifestation ofAIDS was not found on a MEDLINE search of literature. Thiscase is being reported on account of the unusual presentingocular manifestation of AIDS.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Whitcup</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Nussenblatt</surname><given-names/></name><name><surname>Whitcup</surname><given-names>Scott M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome</article-title><source>Uveitis fundamentals and clinical practice</source><year>2004</year><edition>3rd ed</edition><publisher-loc>SA</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Mosby</publisher-name><fpage>185</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Sihota</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Tandon</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ocular manifestation of systemic disorders</article-title><source>Parson&#x02032;s diseases of the eye</source><year>2003</year><edition>19th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Oxford</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Butterworth Heinemann</publisher-name><fpage>565</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><source>National AIDS Control Organization.
