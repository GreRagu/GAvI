We now demostrate that C/EBP&#x003b1; or a C/EBP&#x003b1;LZ oncoprotein bind the bcl-2 P2 promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and induce the promoter dependent on the integrity of a &#x003ba;B site.

Bcl-2 is central to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, while FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP) modulates caspase-8, the initiator caspase of the extrinsic pathway. C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b1;LZ also bind the FLIP promoter and induce its expression dependent upon NF-&#x003ba;B p50. Moreover, induction of FLIP by C/EBP&#x003b1; protects splenocytes from Fas ligand-induced apoptosis, but only if p50 is present. We also demonstrate direct interaction between bacterially produced C/EBP&#x003b1; and NF-&#x003ba;B p50, mediated by the C/EBP&#x003b1; basic region. These findings indicate that C/EBP&#x003b1; or its oncoproteins activate the bcl-2 and FLIP genes by tethering to their promoters via bound NF-&#x003ba;B p50.

Here we show that C/EBP&#x003b1; or a C/EBP&#x003b1;LZ oncogenic variant interact directly with NF-&#x003ba;B p50 to bind and activate the endogenous bcl-2 promoter. Interaction with NF-kB p50 is shown to be essential for activation of bcl-2 by C/EBP&#x003b1;. In addition, C/EBP&#x003b1; or its C/EBP&#x003b1;LZ mutant also bind and activate the FLIP promoter dependent on the presence of NF-&#x003ba;B p50, and induction of FLIP by C/EBP&#x003b1; reduces apoptosis and cell death induced by Fas ligand, indicating that C/EBP&#x003b1; and NF-&#x003ba;B p50 cooperate to regulate both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. We also demonstrate using purified proteins that C/EBP&#x003b1; and NF-&#x003ba;B contact each other directly. The potential for targeting interaction of these proteins as an approach to therapy for AML or other malignancies will be discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cells, plasmids and transient transfection</title><p id="P4">Ba/F3 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS) and 1 ng/mL IL-3 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA).

Together, these data indicate that 42 amino acids (residues 273&#x02013;315) that encompass the C/EBP&#x003b1; BR and the first &#x003b1;-helix of its LZ are important for its interaction with NF-&#x003ba;B family members.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P30">The key conclusions of this study are that C/EBP&#x003b1; binds and activates the endogenous <italic>bcl-2</italic> or <italic>FLIP</italic> promoters via direct interaction of the C/EBP&#x003b1; BR with NF-&#x003ba;B p50. A C/EBP&#x003b1;LZ myeloid oncoprotein that cannot interact with DNA also binds and activates the endogenous <italic>bcl-2</italic> and <italic>FLIP</italic> promoters. These findings have important implications for the role of C/EBP&#x003b1; and other C/EBPs in malignant transformation and for the potential utility of targeting the C/EBP:NF-&#x003ba;B interaction to favor apoptosis of malignant cells.</p><p id="P31">Previously, we found that C/EBP&#x003b1; inhibits apoptosis of Ba/F3 cells upon IL-3 withdrawal and induces endogenous bcl-2 protein in Ba/F3 cells or murine splenocytes; in addition, mutation of the C/EBP&#x003b1; BR prevented trans-activation of the bcl-2 P2 promoter in cooperation with NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and obviated interaction of C/EBP&#x003b1; with NF-&#x003ba;B p50 but not p65 in co-ip experiments using extracts from transfected 293T cells. However, several issues were left unsettled.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> First, the bcl-2 gene has two promoters, both of which have &#x003ba;B sites, and it was unclear whether one, the other, or both was the key target of the C/EBP&#x003b1;:NF-&#x003ba;B p50 complex. We, now demonstrate that C/EBP&#x003b1; or the F3901 C/EBP&#x003b1;LZ oncoprotein specifically induces transcription from the bcl-2 P2 promoter and that these activities are greatly diminished upon mutation of the &#x02212;170 bp &#x003ba;B site. Second, although C/EBP&#x003b1; induces bcl-2 RNA expression and activates the bcl-2 P2-LUC reporter, it was uncertain whether induction of bcl-2 was via direct interaction with the endogenous gene. We now demonstrate using ChIP that C/EBP&#x003b1;, F3901, and NF-&#x003ba;B p50 each localize to the endogenous bcl-2 P2 promoter. Third, although we had correlated loss of C/EBP&#x003b1; interaction with NF-&#x003ba;B p50 and inability to induce bcl-2, we had not proven that interaction with NF-&#x003ba;B p50 is actually required. Now, we find that C/EBP&#x003b1; does not induce endogenous bcl-2 expression or bind the endogenous bcl-2 P2 promoter in cells derived from <italic>nfkb1</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice lacking NF-&#x003ba;B p50. Fourth, although C/EBP&#x003b1; and NF-&#x003ba;B interact when expressed in 293T cells, we had not eliminated the possibility of a bridging protein. Now we demonstrate direct interaction using purified proteins expressed in bacteria. Fifth, although we had implicated the C/EBP&#x003b1; BR as being required for interaction with NF-&#x003ba;B p50 by showing that BR point mutations prevent interaction, we had not assessed whether the BR was sufficient. We now demonstrate that the bZIP domain alone interacts with NF-&#x003ba;B p50. The bZIP domain only includes the BR and LZ. When we replaced the C/EBP&#x003b1; LZ with the homologous region from GCN4, interaction with NF-&#x003ba;B p50 was maintained, although reduced. Together, these data suggest the BR largely accounts for the contact between C/EBP&#x003b1; and NF-&#x003ba;B p50, although further mutagenic studies and perhaps co-crystallization are required to completely map the C/EBP&#x003b1; BR or LZ amino acids that contribute to affinity for NF-&#x003ba;B p50. Interestingly, the bZIP domain also interacted with NF-&#x003ba;B p65, and substitution of the GCN4 LZ in C/EBP&#x003b1; did not reduce affinity for p65, suggesting that NF-&#x003ba;B p65 also predominantly contacts C/EBP&#x003b1; via its BR.</p><p id="P32">Finally, we envision that C/EBP&#x003b1; cooperates with NF-&#x003ba;B p50 to activate additional genes to regulate apoptosis or other pathways and that induction of at least a subset of these requires tethering of C/EBP&#x003b1; to NF-&#x003ba;B p50 bound to DNA, as we surmise occurs on the bcl-2 P2 promoter. We now provide evidence indicating that the FLIP gene falls into this category: Not only C/EBP&#x003b1; but also the F3901 C/EBP&#x003b1;LZ oncoprotein, that cannot bind DNA but retains the ability to bind NF-&#x003ba;B p50, strongly induces FLIP mRNA in Ba/F3 cells; both C/EBP&#x003b1; and F3901 interact with the endogenous FLIP promoter, as does NF-&#x003ba;B p50; and interaction of C/EBP&#x003b1; with the FLIP promoter in the ChIP assay is markedly reduced in cells from <italic>nfkb1</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. In addition, just as we previously found that C/EBP&#x003b1; inhibits apoptosis via the intrinisic pathway upon cytokine withdrawal, we now find that C/EBP&#x003b1; also reduces apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway induced by Fas-FasL interaction.</p><p id="P33">The bZIP domains of C/EBP&#x003b2; and C/EBP&#x003b4; are highly similar to the C/EBP&#x003b1; bZIP domain, and their BR segments are virtually identical. In fact, C/EBP&#x003b2; also inhibits apoptosis of Ba/F3 cells withdrawn from IL-3 (I.P.P. and A.D.F., unpublished). As C/EBP&#x003b2; is widely expressed, we suggest that many cell types, and their malignant counterparts, express bcl-2, FLIP and other genes due to C/EBP:NF-&#x003ba;B cooperation. NF-&#x003ba;B most commonly exists as p65:p50 or p50:p50 dimers in cells. Each of these complexes includes an NF-&#x003ba;B p50 subunit available to interact with the C/EBP BR, and the p65 subunit also interacts with C/EBP&#x003b1; or C/EBP&#x003b2;, though potentially with reduced affinity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> A subset of C/EBP:NF-&#x003ba;B target genes are regulated by binding of both a C/EBP and an NF-&#x003ba;B dimer to separate <italic>cis</italic> DNA elements in their regulatory regions, whereas an additional subset of genes bind NF-&#x003ba;B which then potentially attract one or more C/EBP family member to the promoter via protein:protein interaction, expanding the repertoire of C/EBP target genes. Of note, F3901 retains the ability to induce bcl-2 and FLIP but cannot activate the NE gene, whose promoter does not bind NF-&#x003ba;B p50, indicating a mechanism that allows this C/EBP&#x003b1; oncoprotein to inhibit apoptosis without inducing myeloid differentiation. In fact, <italic>CEBPA</italic> LZ mutation reduces expression of wild-type C/EBP&#x003b1;, thereby interfering with normal differentiation.</p><p id="P34">Besides genes that regulate apoptosis, C/EBP and NF-&#x003ba;B cooperatively bind and activate multiple genes that contribute to inflammation, including those encoding IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, serum amyloid, ICAM-1, superoxide dismutase, and Mediterranean fever promoter.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Notably, the C/EBP&#x003b2; bZIP domain alone increases the activity of the IL-6 promoter and does so only if the adjacent NF-&#x003ba;B binding site is intact.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> We propose that direct interaction of C/EBP family members with NF-&#x003ba;B dimers inhibits both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways via induction of bcl-2, FLIP, and other genetic targets and is also important for induction of inflammation.
