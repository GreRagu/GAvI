Of specific interest are &#x003b1;II-spectrin breakdown products (SBDPs), which are produced by proteolytic events in traumatic brain injury and have been used as biomarkers to predict the severity of injury in humans and other mammalian brain injury models. This study describes and demonstrates the successful use of antibody-based mammalian SBDP biomarkers to detect head injury in migrating juvenile Chinook salmon (<italic>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</italic>) that have been injured during passage through high-energy hydraulic environments present in spillways under different operational configurations. Mortality and injury assessment techniques currently measure only near-term direct mortality and easily observable acute injury. Injury-based biomarkers may serve as a quantitative indicator of subacute physical injury and recovery, and aid hydropower operators in evaluation of safest passage configuration and operation actions for migrating juvenile salmonids. We describe a novel application of SBDP biomarkers for head injury for migrating salmon. To our knowledge, this is the first documented cross-over use of a human molecular biomarker in a wildlife and operational risk management scenario.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The migration of juvenile salmonids downriver on the Columbia and Snake Rivers has been contested to be compromised due to the multiple hydropower facilities located on these rivers. Physical injury resulting from impacts with spillway structures and turbines and hydraulic forces associated with spill and sudden depth changes are two main hazards associated with hydropower-related passage. Laboratory studies of the effect of exposure to severe hydraulic events on juvenile salmonids have found a variety of adverse effects caused by strike, shear, pressure gradients, and disorientation. Recent studies have also found that fish exposed to high shear and turbulence are subject to direct injury and are more susceptible to predation than migrating fish which have non-turbulent passage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Neitzel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Current efforts to assess these and strike-related injuries are performed using a direct injury and mortality approach by gross observation up to 48 hours post passage or condition treatment. Subacute injuries are not routinely measured as there is no available metric to determine non-visible injuries short of assessments for disorientation following laboratory treatment, and this type of observation is not used in field studies for testing hydropower structure configurations. Injury-based biomarkers may serve as quantitative indicators of injury severity. Because head injury likely results from physical trauma, such as impacting a physical structure or extreme high velocities, the development of a biomarker assay to quickly assess subacute physical injury and recovery is essential to determine the impact of hydropower structures on fish health.</p><p>Recent advances in biomedical research have resulted in the development of a specific mammalian biomarker to rapidly assess traumatic brain injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Wang1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Pineda1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Subsets of fish were collected from different passage conditions according to facility guidelines based on US Fish and Wildlife Service fish hatchery management practices, and in accordance with approved animal care and use protocols. A control group consisted of a subset of the fish obtained for the study that were handled similarly to the passage treatments, but were released through the juvenile fish bypass facility chute at Ice Harbor Lock and Dam, and did not experience spillway passage hydraulic conditions or deflector obstructions. The control group in the field tests essentially served as a sham group to assess impacts from spillway conditions and not from tagging and handling conditions. Bypass chute conditions essentially consisted of a horizontal raceway flume with a 2 foot drop from discharge to collection. Fish were collected post-passage, examined for visible external injury (eye hemorrhage, eye loss, descaling, and abrasions) and sampled for brain tissue following the conclusion of the standard 48-hour holding time for direct mortality (i.e., balloon-tag) observations. Twenty fish each from different passage scenarios and 10 control fish were collected and euthanized in 250 mg/L tricaine methane sulfonate followed by decapitation prior to excising whole brain tissue.

In addition the exogenous caspase-3 produced a 120 kDa (SBDP120) in salmon brain lysate that is normally seen in the rat. Both enzymes produced the 150 kDa (SBDP150) in the fish brain. These observations suggest that &#x003b1;II-spectrin of salmon contains several of the preferred cleavage sites for mammalian caspase-3 to produce SBDP120 and SBDP150, but that it has additional sites that are sensitive to both the mammalian and endogenous caspase enzymes.</p><p>In the case of calpain, both the exogenously added enzyme and the endogenous enzyme (activated by the addition of CaCl<sub>2</sub>) produced a fragment of 150 kDa, as seen in the rat.

While disease and vector transmission implications to human health are the drivers for this type of risk management, the animal populations in question are monitored for disease exposure, overall health and productivity.

However, the specificity of many of these markers, or biomarkers, remains questionable for wildlife management practices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Robbens1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Perkins1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Aside from biological or chemical exposures, there has been no documented assessment of acute or sub-lethal injury impacts resulting from physical trauma in wildlife. The importance of this study illustrates the success in using a biomarker for mammalian or human head injury to determine head injury in migrating juvenile salmon as a result of hydropower passage management; and represents the first study to examine the efficacy of a human-based molecular biomarker metric for risk management.</p><p>Unique and differential &#x003b1;II-spectrin breakdown products were first shown to be generated by calpain and caspase proteases in cell culture neurotoxic models and <italic>in vitro</italic>, producing SBDP150/SBDP145 and SBDP150i/SBDP120, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Nath2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Wang4">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Pike and colleagues were also the first to observe the same major SBDPs in different affected rat brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Pike2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Pike1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> following experimental traumatic brain injury (controlled cortical impact). In the current study, spillway force-induced brain injury in salmon brain robustly produces SBDPs parallel to those produced by their mammalian counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004491-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004491-g004"><bold>4</bold></xref>). When compared with the visible injury observations 48 hours post passage, the trends in passage impact correlate with the presence of SBDP120. In particular, the abundance of SBDP120 shows increasing expression with increasing visible injury. Predicted amino acid sequence homology for the SBDP120 cleavage site, and binding of the specific SBDP120 antibody provide strong evidence for conservation of functional homology. Based on the known mammalian expression pattern, the increase in expression is hypothesized to be evidence of apoptotic breakdown of intact &#x003b1;II-spectrin, a likely event that would occur following physical trauma to brain tissues. The lack of complete homology of mammalian SBDPs in salmon brain tissues may be related more to the evidence of genome duplication in the salmonids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-deBoer1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and the loss of function due to redundancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Bergthorsson1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, or adaptation for different functions. Without a complete &#x003b1;II-spectrin sequence in salmon, these remain assumptions.</p><p>Two different pathways that lead to brain cell death are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004491-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref><bold>,</bold> showing how calpain and caspase proteases may break down salmonid brain cellular proteins during both acute necrosis and delayed apoptosis phases of salmon head injury, respectively. Therefore, &#x003b1;II-spectrin was degraded by these two proteases, producing SBDPs as possible spillway force-mediated salmon brain injury biomarkers. Based on this study, there appears to be basal levels of SBDPs expressed in salmon brain tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004491-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>), which may indicate a normal turnover of neuronal cells experienced during juvenile growth. Indeed, Zupanc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Zupanc1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> reviews the capability of teleost brain tissues to display continuous neurogenesis postembryonically and into adulthood. Soutschek and Zupanc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Soutschek1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Soutschek2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> describe the neuronal turnover process as apoptotic regulation, but increased apoptosis is also seen in response to injury and removal of injured or affected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-Zupanc1">&#x0005b;reviewed in 31&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the difference in hydraulic force is orders of magnitude lower than passage through the spillway structures, it is possible that the bypassed fish used as a field control experienced some mild injury, and may account for the presence of SBDPs. However, the hatchery control fish used for the protease digests did not experience any field-related hydraulic forces, and the presence of SBDPs in the control fish lends support to the neurogenesis hypothesis. The increase in SBDP120 appears to correlate with observations of head injury and could be used as a potential biomarker for subacute brain damage induced by migration passage. These results have increased significance following the recent Biological Opinion for the Federal Columbia River Power System <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004491-NOAA1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> for cooperating agencies to develop configuration and operations plans that detail overall survival improvements for in-river migrating fish.</p><fig id="pone-0004491-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004491.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Schematic for protease-mediated salmon brain injury and the production of SBDP biomarkers in the brain.</title><p>For details, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Discussion</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004491.g006"/></fig><p>Although currently there is no threshold head injury biomarker expression level known that would indicate an outcome such as recovery, impaired health, or delayed mortality, the results can be compared among passage types to determine optimal passage trajectories, and are an improvement over current assessments that involve visible injury assessment for hundreds of fish per passage type.

However, CSF is not a viable alternative for juvenile fish that range in total size from 80&#x02013;140 mm. Blood samples (including serum or plasma) may be a preferable biofluid for salmon brain injury biomarker monitoring. We are working to get salmon specific antibodies to enable the detection of the biomarker in blood. In addition, future work to assess degree of injury in relation to specific outcomes are underway and will include temporal studies under defined, laboratory simulations to determine more specific biomarker metrics for longer-term prognosis of fish outcome.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Normandeau and Associates Inc. and the US Army Corps of Engineers for allowing us to subsample fish involved in field tests at Ice Harbor Lock and Dam.
