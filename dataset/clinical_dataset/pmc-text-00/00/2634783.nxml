The Food and Drug Administration and American Dental Association recommend screening radiography for every newly edentulous patient because of high prevalence of findings such as root fragments and radiolucencies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-0020283">8</xref> Panoramic radiography is commonly used in large intuitional settings as a method of screening partially and fully edentulous patients. It is reported that in Japan 10 million panoramic radiographs are taken annually,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-0020283">9</xref> and it is reported that between 1998 and 1999, approximately 2.05 million panoramic radiographs were taken in the general dental service in England and Wales.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-0020283">9</xref> Researchers have developed a number of panoramic based mandibular indices, image processing and analyzing techniques for quantification of mandibular bone mass and trabecular architecture to discriminate osteoporotic patients from non-osteoporotic ones.

In a study, Horner and Devlin evaluated whether a relationship exists between mandibular cortical index and bone mineral density of the body of the mandible as measured by dual energy X-ray dual absorptiometry. They reported that MCI was significantly related to bone mineral density of the body of the mandible but there were limitations in its repeatability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-0020283">14</xref> Taguchi et al evaluated MCI and mandibular cortical width on panoramic radiographs and compared them with bone mineral density of either the lumbar spine or the femoral neck. They concluded that the odds ratio of having osteoporosis was 5.90 in women identified by cortical width and 8.66 in women identified by cortical shape of the mandible.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-0020283">15</xref> Again, in another study, Taguchi et al evaluated the effectiveness of MCI in discriminating osteoporotic patients with 60 observers from 16 countries of the world and reported that the overall mean sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the 60 observers in identifying women with osteoporosis by cortical erosion panoramic radiographs were 82.5, 46.2, 46.7, and 84% respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-0020283">16</xref> The repeatability of this index is also evaluated and while some studies were reporting satisfactory levels of agreement,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-0020283">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-0020283">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-0020283">17</xref> others were reporting lower levels of agreement, especially between different observers even among expert observers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-0020283">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-0020283">18</xref> As a consequence of this finding, the authors reported that this limits the technique&#x02019;s applicability clinically.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-0020283">18</xref></p><p>Fractal analysis is a mathematical technique which is helpful in the quantification of complex structures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-0020283">19</xref> The fractal dimension describes how an object occupies space and is related to the complexity of its structure: it gives a numerical measure of the degree of boundary irregularity or surface roughness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-0020283">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-0020283">21</xref> Lacunarity was initially introduced by Mandelbrot as a means of further classifying fractals and textures which had the same FD and a very different visual appearance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-0020283">21</xref> Lacunarity is a measure of how the fractal fills space, if the fractal is dense the lacunarity is small, the lacunarity increases with coarseness. Higher lacunarity values indicate wider range of sizes of structures within an image.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-0020283">22</xref> An advantage of lacunarity is that it is not predicated on fractalness or self similarity, and is therefore useful for natural images and also medical images that may show at most only a limited fractalness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-0020283">22</xref> These techniques are quantitative techniques and have no observer dependency. Evaluating the mandibular cortical shape with these techniques would eliminate the observer dependency and might improve the usefulness of mandibular cortical shape in screening osteoporotic patients.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity can discriminate patients having different MCI classifications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Randomly selected panoramic radiographs of 52 patients which were taken during routine dental examination were included to the study (2002 CC Proline PlanMeca Helsinki Finland). None of the patients had systemic disease which effects bone metabolism and their ages were between 40&#x02013;64. In the first part of the study, the panoramic radiographs were evaluated for MCI classification by the same observer three times with four weeks intervals. The agreement between the observations was calculated with weighted Kappa statistics.</p><p>Among these panoramic radiographs, 22 of them which were evaluated as Class 1 in at least two observations were accepted as Class 1; accordingly 20 panoramic radiographs were accepted as Class 2 and 10 panoramic radiographs were accepted as Class 3. These radiographs were scanned in 300 dots per inch resolution with a scanner having transparency adaptor. Image processing and analyzing was performed with ImageJ program.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-0020283">23</xref> On these radiographs region of interests (ROI), where best represents the mandibular cortical morphology were created both in left and right side. FD in box-counting method and Lacunarity were calculated from these ROIs and the mean values of them were used in the study.</p><p>The radiographs were arbitrarily rotated until the basal cortical bone where the ROI will be created becomes parallel to the horizontal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-0020283">Figure 1</xref>). The ROIs extended in the medio-lateral direction and when creating ROIs, great care was shown to include only the inferior cortical bone of the mandible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-0020283">Figure 2</xref>). Digital images were segmented to binary image as described by White and Rudolph.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-0020283">24</xref> The ROIs were duplicated and blurred by a Gaussian filter with a diameter of 35 pixels. The resulting heavily blurred image was then subtracted from the original, and 128 was added to the result at each pixel location. The image was then made binary, thresholding on a brightness value of 128 and inverted. With this method, the regions which represent trabecular bone were set to white and porosities of the cortical bone were set to black (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-0020283">Figure 3</xref>). The aim of this operation was to reflect individual variations in the image such as cortical bone and porosities.</p><p>Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity were calculated with ImageJ plugin named FracLacCirc (First Version). FracLacCirc calculates the box counting Fractal Dimension using a shifting grid algorithm that does multiple scans on each image, and it is suitable for analyzing images of biological cells and textures. It works on only binarized images, so images must be thresholded prior to analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-0020283">23</xref></p><p>Weighted Kappa index, which was calculated with a program named ComKappa,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-0020283">25</xref> was used as a measure of intra-observer agreement for cortical index evaluation. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Levene&#x02019;s tests were used to check for the normality and homogeneity of the data. ANOVA was used to evaluate whether Fractal Dimension differs significantly between the patients having Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 MCI morphology using P value as 0.05 with 95% confidence interval. As multiple comparisons were made, Bonferroni was used as post-hoc test. The data of Lacunarity (P:0.012) did not have normal distribution in mandibular cortices which were classified as Cl 2, so Kruskal Wallis test was used to evaluate whether Lacunarity differs significantly between the patients having Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 and Mann Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction was used for paired comparisons. SPSS 10.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for the statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The agreements between the observations are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-0020283">Table 1</xref>.

The data of Fractal Dimension was showing normal distribution (P:0.200 for Cl 1, P:0.112 for Cl 2, and P:0.200 for Cl 3); and it was homogeneous (FD P:0.744). However, the data of Lacunarity did not show normal distribution in radiographs which were classified as having CL 2 mandibular cortical shape (P:0.200 for Cl 1; P:0.012 for Cl 2; and P:0.200 for Cl 3).</p><p>ANOVA test results showed that there were statistically significant difference between Fractal Dimension (P=0.000) values in patients having different MCI morphology (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-0020283">Table 3</xref>). As multiple comparisons were made, Bonferroni was used as post-hoc test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-0020283">Table 4</xref>). It was found that there were statistically significant difference between the Fractal Dimension of radiographs which were classified as having Cl 1 and Cl 2 (P=0.000); and Cl 1 and Cl 3 cortical morphology (P=0.008); but there was no statistically significant difference between Fractal Dimension of radiographs which were classified as having Cl 2 and Cl 3 cortical morphology (P=1.000). For Lacunarity, Kruskal Wallis test was used and it was found that there was also statistically significant difference between different MCI groups for Lacunarity (P=0.001). The mean differences were significant at the 0.05 level (P=0.05) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-0020283">Table 5</xref>). For paired comparisons between the groups, Mann Whitney U statistics with Bonferroni correction was used. It was found that there was statistically significant difference between Cl 1 and Cl 2 (P=0.003) and Cl 1 and Cl 3 (P=0.001) but there weren&#x02019;t statistically significant difference between Cl 2 and Cl 3 (P=0.758) as in FD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-0020283">Table 5</xref>).</p><p>According to the results of this study, the mandibular cortex having Cl 1 cortical morphology is less complex and more heterogeneous than Cl 2 and Cl 3. That means, there is wider range of sizes of structures within the cortices which are classified as Cl 1 and contrary to this, the cortices which are classified as having Cl 3 cortical morphology are more complex and homogeneous, that is the sizes of the porosities within the cortices are similar to each other.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Panoramic mandibular index (PMI),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-0020283">27</xref> mandibular cortical width (CW),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-0020283">28</xref> antegonial AGI),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-0020283">29</xref> gonial index (GI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-0020283">30</xref> and mandibular cortical index (MCI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-0020283">12</xref> are panoramic based indices which are developed to discriminate osteoporotic patients from non-osteoporotic ones. Some of the researchers reported that, these indices were effective in discriminating osteoporotic patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-0020283">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-0020283">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-0020283">30</xref> but there are other studies in which some of these indices were reported to be not useful in identifying osteoporotic patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-0020283">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-0020283">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-0020283">31</xref> Some measurements and calculations are necessary in PMI, CW, AGI and GI. Among these indices, MCI is relatively simple because no measurements or calculations are required but it depends on visual assessments. Its repeatability has been evaluated and especially inter-observer agreement is reported to be poor in some of the studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-0020283">19</xref> However, Bollen et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-0020283">11</xref> Klemetti et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-0020283">12</xref> Taguchi et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-0020283">13</xref> have reported satisfactory levels of inter and intra-observer agreement. Visual perception of human eye and brain has an inevitable role in all kinds of evaluations performed on radiographs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-0020283">32</xref> This limits the repeatability and as a consequence of this, clinical application of these measurements or evaluations.</p><p>As in other fields of medicine,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-0020283">33</xref> Fractal Dimension has also found applications in dental studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-0020283">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-0020283">35</xref> It is found to be efficacious in discriminating osteoporotic patients from non-osteoporotic ones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-0020283">36</xref> and both Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity could discriminate dentate from edentulous regions in mandibular posterior region.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-0020283">37</xref> In MCI evaluations, the porosity of mandibular cortical bone is evaluated visually and a limitation in its repeatability, especially between different observers, is reported to be a serious problem for the method to be used clinically.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-0020283">18</xref> Contrary to the subjective nature of MCI evaluations, Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity are quantitative measurement methods and have no dependency on observers. According to the results of this study, it can be concluded that both Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity can discriminate patients having Cl 1 from Cl 2 and Cl 1 from Cl 3 mandibular cortical morphology but they cannot differentiate Cl 2 from Cl 3. The mandibular cortex has more complex structure in patients having Cl 2 MCI classification than Cl 1. So the finding of this study is concordant with the description of Fractal Dimension because more complex objects have a higher Fractal Dimension. Lacunarity is related to the distribution of gap sizes: the objects having low lacunarity are homogeneous because all gap sizes are the same, whereas high lacunarity objects are heterogeneous.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-0020283">22</xref> Lacunarity is low in objects having higher Fractal Dimension.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-0020283">22</xref> According to the results of this study, the structure of the cortical bone which is classified as Cl 1 has less porous structure than Cl 2 and Cl 3 cortices, and the sizes of the gaps are less similar to each other in Cl 1 than Cl 2 and Cl 3 radiographically.</p><p>As reported in a study performed by Taguchi et al, mandibular cortical shape which is defined as Cl 2 has a greater range of appearances radiographically than Cl 1 and Cl 3 because early cases can sometimes be defined as Cl 1 by some observers and also some late cases of Cl 2 can be defined as Cl 3 by other observers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-0020283">38</xref> In this study there was no case which was classified as Cl 1 in one observation and Cl 3 in the other observation. However, there were some cases which were classified as Cl 1 in one of the observations and Cl 2 in the other or Cl 2 in one of the observations and Cl 3 in the other. This means that, probably some early cases of Cl 2 may be classified as Cl 1 and similarly, some late cases of Cl 2 may be classified as Cl 3 in some observations. Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity can differentiate Cl 1 from both Cl 2 and Cl 3 but they cannot differentiate Cl 2 from Cl 3. The appearance of Cl 1 and Cl 3 are widely different from each other but the appearance of Cl 3 and late Cl 2 cases may resemble each other so Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity cannot discriminate them. In this study, the number of radiographs which were classified as Cl 3 was relatively less than the radiographs which were classified as Cl 1 and Cl 2 and this might also have a role on not discriminating Cl 2 from Cl 3.</p><p>Halling et al compared mean bone mineral density measurement by heel DEXA in the osteopenic (MCI 3 group) and normal groups (MCI 1 and MCI 2 groups were combined) and they reported that a negative finding is highly predictive of the absence of osteopenia/osteoporosis as defined by the DEXA measurements.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-0020283">39</xref> Combining this finding with the results of this study, a threshold value for Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity can be generated by studying with large sample sizes and patients having higher Fractal Dimension and lower Lacunarity values from these thresholds can be conveyed to bone densitometry clinics for further evaluation to rule out the possibility of osteoporosis especially when the patient has other risk factors in addition. Calculating Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity may somewhat be time consuming and prevent the method to be a real time method because the radiographs should be scanned first. However, digital panoramic machines are replacing the conventional machines in many of the countries and this would increase the applicability of the procedure. Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity are quantitative measurements and they don&#x02019;t have observer dependency as radiomorphometric indices based on panoramic radiographs. The only part that depends on the observer is to choose the place of the ROI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, contrary to other radiomorphometric indices, such as PMI, MCW, AGI and GI; in MCI no measurements and calculations are needed but visual assessment plays a significant role and this creates a major limitation in the application of the technique clinically, especially in inter-observer agreement. It is possible to differentiate mandibular cortices having Cl 1 cortices from Cl 2 and Cl 3 cortices by evaluating MCI quantitatively with Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity however Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity could not differentiate Cl 2 cases from Cl 3. The reason of this might be the relatively small number of cases having Cl 3 cortices and it can be advised that Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity can be used as supportive diagnostic techniques to MCI in cases where inter-observer agreement is important and desired because these techniques are independent from observers and they can overcome the limitation of disagreement among observers in MCI classification. The Kappa values of this study were varying between 0.718&#x02013;0.805 and this may be seen as visual evaluation of MCI is superior to Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity because these techniques could not differentiate Cl 2 cases from Cl 3, but the real limitation of visual evaluation of MCI is reported to be in inter-observer agreement in various studies and these techniques would overcome this limitation of MCI evaluation by eliminating observer dependency. As it was aimed to evaluate whether Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity could differentiate different shapes of mandibular cortical bone in this preliminary study, the bone mineral density status of the patients were not known. Further study is needed with osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic patients and greater sample size especially for Cl 3 cases. In that case it would be possible to evaluate whether Fractal Dimension and Lacunarity can discriminate osteoporotic patients from non-osteoporotic ones.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by Scientific Research Projects (BAP) of Selcuk University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-0020283"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><collab>NIH Consensus Development Panel</collab><article-title>Osteoporosis prevention, diagnosis and therapy</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2000</year><volume>285</volume><fpage>785</fpage><lpage>795</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="b2-0020283"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Eddy</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Jonston</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Cummings</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><name><surname>Dawson-Hughes</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindsay</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Melton</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Osteoporosis: Review of the evidence for prevention, diagnosis and treatment and cost effectiveness analysis.
