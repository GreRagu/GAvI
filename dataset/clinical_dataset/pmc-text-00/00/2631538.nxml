H<sub>2</sub>-blockers, PPI and enterokinesis activators were commenced elsewhere. Two weeks later, she was referred to us for intractable vomiting and epigastric pain. There was no family history of peptic ulcer. Abdominal radiology was suggestive of pyloric obstruction but ultrasonography showed a normal pylorus. On barium meal, there was no passage of barium from the stomach to the duodenum and the stomach was distended with increased peristalsis. On endoscopy, the antrum was so narrowed circumferentially that the endoscope could not be passed through, but surprisingly, the mucosa was normal without scarring (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Serum gastrin was normal, and serology and biopsies for <italic>H pylori </italic>were negative. Imaging analyses and laparoscopic investigation revealed no obvious compression from surrounding organs. Endoscopic balloon dilatation was performed twice without improvement so surgery was planned. At laparotomy, gastrotomy was performed transversely over the antrum just proximal to the stricture and the lesion delivered through the incision (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The mucosa was incised circumferentially 5 mm proximal to the antral stricture and dissected free from underlying fibrotic scar tissue which was then excised with great care to not perforate the gastric wall. After excising the fibrotic tissue, the stricture was released and the antrum expanded nicely. The mucosa, submucosa, and healthy muscle layers were then approximated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). An endoscopic finding 6 months after surgery, no stricture is seen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Endoscopic finding before surgery</bold>.

There are some reports of children with GOO secondary to peptic ulceration being treated successfully with vagotomy combined with pyloroplasty, anterectomy, or gastrojejunostomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and Billroth I, Billroth II, or pyloroplasty have also been used to treat GOO with good results. In these reports, peptic ulceration did not recur and failure to thrive was not seen in any of these cases in childhood. However, anterectomy is relatively invasive in children, and gastrojejunostomy has a risk for peptic ulceration on the anastomotic site. Pyloroplasty may change the angle of the pyloric canal which may disrupt the smooth passage of stomach contents into the duodenum postoperatively. We experienced such complications in patients who had pyloroplasty elsewhere. Some authors have advocated balloon dilatation of the pylorus in adults, but its long-term efficacy has not been proven in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In adults, the short-term failure and long-term recurrence rates for balloon dilatation have been reported to be as high as 30&#x02013;84% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In our case, balloon dilatation was not effective, and we perform the procedure described here for GOO in children.</p><p>In the present case, we did not perform vagotomy because serum gastrin was normal and <italic>H pylori </italic>was negative. Surprisingly, the mucosa of the antral stricture was normal and no mucosal scar was identified on preoperative endoscopy or intraoperatively, although mucosal scarring is usually present after treatment of peptic ulceration according to other reports in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our procedure is simple and does not cause any anatomic or physiologic changes.</p><p>We believe our procedure is suitable for patients with GOO secondary to peptic ulceration and should be considered as one of the indications for surgical intervention in children with GOO with normal serum gastrin.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>GOO: Gastric outlet obstruction; H<sub>2</sub>: Histamine-2; PPI: Proton Pump Inhibitors; H pylori: Helicobacter Pylori</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.
