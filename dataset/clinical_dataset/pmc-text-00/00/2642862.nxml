Fifteen patients fulfilling the criteria set by international researchers in the field at the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in 1994 for chronic fatigue syndrome, were included in the study. The patients had high fatigue severity scores and high disability scores. During the first two weeks baseline observations without treatment were assessed, succeeded by four weeks of intake of a probiotic product and a four-week follow-up period. The fatigue, health and physical activity was assessed by the use of the Visual Analogue Scales and the SF-12 Health Survey. Faecal samples were collected and the normal microflora was analysed. Neurocognitive functions improved during the study period while there were no significant changes in fatigue and physical activity scores. No major changes occurred in the gastrointestinal microflora. At the end of the study 6 of 15 patients reported that they had improved according to the assessment described. The findings in this study that improvement of health is possible to achieve should encourage further studies with interventions with probiotics in patients with CFS.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a medically unexplained illness characterized by persistent and debilitating fatigue with a minimum duration of six months. The current case definition set by an international expert group 1994 includes at least 4 of 8 designated symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The prevalence of CFS range between 0.2 and 2.6% in patients attending primary care and in community based surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In a recent nationwide study from Sweden the prevalence of CFS-like illness (defined as meeting all self-reported criteria for CFS but lacking the physical examination) was 2.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The aetiology and pathophysiology of the syndrome remains unknown but several factors have been discussed. Among factors that have been implicated in triggering or mediating the course of the disease are infective disorders, immune system disorders, neuroendocrine abnormalities and neuropsychological impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It has been suggested that immune dysfunctions that has been observed in CFS patients account for a number of the described symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The CFS patients have a cytokine imbalance in the peripheral blood compartment and the system is biased towards a T-helper (Th) 2 type immunity-oriented pattern. This is reflected in the high incidence of allergies in CFS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, comorbidity between CFS and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been identified in a number of studies and a high degree of overlapping symptoms has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The irritable bowel syndrome is a functional bowel disorder characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain or discomfort that is associated with disturbed defecation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. There is evidence suggesting that the intestinal microflora of patients with IBS differs from that of healthy individuals and that the patients have an abnormal fermentation of food residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The intestinal microflora in CFS patients have also been shown to be altered with low levels of <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>and <italic>Bifidobacterium </italic>species and with significant increased numbers of enterococci compared to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. An elevated number of Candida albicans in the faecal microflora of CFS patients during the acute phase of illness has recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Recently it has also been pointed out that oxidative stress and food intolerance might be involved in the pathogenesis of CFS and in the symptom presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is still uncertain whether oxidative stress is a cause or a result of the disease. However, various antioxidants have shown promise as a part of CFS treatment protocols. The information concerning food intolerance and CFS is limited but there are indications of alleviation of symptoms and reduction in fatigue when food elimination protocols have been followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>There is increasing evidence that consumption of foods containing microorganisms is beneficial in prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Several trials have been performed on the effect of probiotics in IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The administration of probiotics resulted in reduced flatulence and abdominal pain in three of the studies. However, in one study where enterocoated tablets were used and in one where a lower concentration of probiotic lactobacilli were administered, no effect was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria have been investigated for their antioxidative activity. Several species have been identified that are capable of chelating metal ions, scavenging reactive oxygen species and that possess reducing activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Human intestinal isolates of lactobacilli have also been shown to be strong stimulators of interleukin 12 (IL-12) from monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It has been suggested that supplements with lactic acid producing bacteria apart from modifying the microflora also deviate the immune phenotype and correct the Th2-type bias that promotes allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Probiotic lactobacilli have further been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of food allergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Lactic acid producing bacteria have recently been suggested as therapeutic agents in the treatment of CFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Potential benefits for CFS patients could be regulation of the composition of the microflora, the impact on the cytokine balance and the action of the probiotic strains as antioxidants. There are no studies performed on the effects of probiotics in CFS.</p><p>The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei </italic>ssp. <italic>paracasei </italic>F19, <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus </italic>NCFB 1748 and <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis </italic>Bb12 on fatigue and physical activity in CFS patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Fifteen patients (10 females and 5 men) fulfilling the 1994 CDC criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome were included in the study.

After incubation different colony types were counted, isolated in pure cultures and identified to genus level.

Also, the high impact on society points at the necessity to find treatments through other mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As the bowel is an important organ for equilibrium in health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] the use of probiotics as "anti-fatigue-food" is a temptating treatment both from the point of cost and availability as from biological functions as the neurocognitive system can be influenced through immune reactions involving cytokines and anti-oxidants. The theoretical background is thus solid enough to justify a performance of an intervention. Disturbances reported in the gut flora could not be reproduced in this study. The design included a period of baseline observation, treatment and a follow-up period. The patients became their own controls. The advantage here is that confounding factors that exist between individuals affecting the flora as diet and other daily behaviours are controlled for. However, as CFS has a fluctuating natural course it could affect the outcome. By including a satisfying large number of patients this could be controlled for. The present study is a pilot study.</p><p>Another comment that is frequently made is that the placebo effect should be high in this condition as it is of subjective nature. However, it has been demonstrated that the placebo effects in CFS is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The different responses in patients demonstrate the heterogeneity of the patient population. Recent studies have pointed out the need for subgrouping of patients or maybe even a new definition of the syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. When the average is calculated there is no influence of the intervention but for individuals it can have a clear effect whether it is improvement or worsening. The low number of subjects makes it impossible to study gender differences. There is a significant improvement for the studied population for neurocognitive functions with sustainability as it is demonstrated at the end of the follow-up (day 70). Also almost half of the subjects report improvement on the four-item scale and a number of subjects report improvement in general health according to SF-12.</p><p>What is very clear is the severity of the condition as described through SF12 for both physical and mental health. For both women and men their report of physical and mental health is less than the norm for the general Swedish population age 75 years and above. Studies from the US show that CFS can be as disabling as multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, end-stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and similar chronic conditions.</p><p>The high cost for society has been calculated by the Center for Disease Control, Atlanta to be more than 9 billion dollars in the US in lost productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], not including medical costs or disability benefits.
