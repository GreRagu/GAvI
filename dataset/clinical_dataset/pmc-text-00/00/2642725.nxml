To study this crucial type of infection, its specific environment needs to be taken into account, in particular the mechanical forces generated by the blood flow. In a previous study using <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> as a model, we observed that bacterial microcolonies forming on the endothelial cell surface in the vessel lumen are remarkably resistant to mechanical stress. The present study aims to identify the molecular basis of this resistance. <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> forms aggregates independently of host cells, yet we demonstrate here that cohesive forces involved in these bacterial aggregates are not sufficient to explain the stability of colonies on cell surfaces. Results imply that host cell attributes enhance microcolony cohesion. Microcolonies on the cell surface induce a cellular response consisting of numerous cellular protrusions similar to filopodia that come in close contact with all the bacteria in the microcolony. Consistent with a role of this cellular response, host cell lipid microdomain disruption simultaneously inhibited this response and rendered microcolonies sensitive to blood flow&#x02013;generated drag forces. We then identified, by a genetic approach, the type IV pili component PilV as a triggering factor of plasma membrane reorganization, and consistently found that microcolonies formed by a <italic>pilV</italic> mutant are highly sensitive to shear stress. Our study shows that bacteria manipulate host cell functions to reorganize the host cell surface to form filopodia-like structures that enhance the cohesion of the microcolonies and therefore blood vessel colonization under the harsh conditions of the bloodstream.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Certain infectious agents reach the bloodstream and succeed in surviving and multiplying at this site. This stage of the infection is associated with a life-threatening condition. The Gram-negative bacterium meningococcus, responsible for septicemia and meningitis, stands out as a paradigm of such a pathogen. Despite the characteristic flow-generated hydrodynamic forces of the bloodstream, meningococci have the striking ability to bind to the endothelium and to multiply in bacterial aggregates called microcolonies. Meningococci form aggregates in absence of eukaryotic cells, but we show that such aggregates are sensitive to mechanical stress, indicating that the presence of host cells enhances microcolony cohesion. Consistently, analysis of meningococcal microcolonies growing on the host cellular surface reveals that these structures are dense with cellular material in the form of cellular protrusions. Blocking this bacteria-induced cellular response renders microcolonies sensitive to blood flow. We then identify a bacterial component located on the outside of the bacteria and in direct contact with host cells as a key factor in the induction of this cellular response. This bacteria-induced cellular response is therefore a striking example of how pathogens exploit cellular functions as a survival strategy, in this case in the particular context of the bloodstream.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infectious diseases leading to colonization of the blood by the infectious agent are a major burden to society. Such infections lead to devastating clinical manifestations including septic shock, hemorrhagic syndromes or infection of the brain (meningitis). Pathogens triggering such diseases are diverse and include viruses, bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative), parasites and fungi. The common characteristic of these pathogens is their presence in the bloodstream at a given point of the infection process. Such pathogens are exposed to mechanical forces exerted by the blood flow, which follows a complex pattern throughout different blood vessels. This specific environment is increasingly recognized as a determining factor during pathogenesis and implies an adaptation of the pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Cooke1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Antia1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. One such infectious agent, used as a model in this study, is the Gram-negative bacteria <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Mairey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>N. meningitidis</italic> infection leads to two distinct clinical manifestations, a rapidly evolving form of septicemia or meningitis. The only known reservoir is the human nasopharynx, where the bacterium multiplies without causing symptoms in 10&#x02013;20&#x00025; of the human population who serve as carriers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Caugant1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. At a low frequency, bacteria cross the epithelial barrier and access the bloodstream, causing septicemia. In the bloodstream, <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> interact with endothelial cells, cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and proliferate in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Mairey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Nassif1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>One property of this pathogen thought to be key both in nasopharynx colonization and in disease development is its ability to adhere to host cells. As is the case for numerous pathogens, adhesive properties of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> are mediated by filamentous organelles designated type IV pili <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Swanson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to adhesion, type IV pili allow bacteria to spontaneously form large aggregates in suspension and on the cellular surface. In <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, expression of functional type IV pili on the bacterial surface requires 22 <italic>pil</italic> genes. The main and structural component of a pilus is the pilin, a protein encoded by the <italic>pilE</italic> gene in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>. After being cleaved by the prepilin peptidase PilD, pilin subunits assemble in a helical fiber in the periplasm and exit the outer membrane through a pore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Wolfgang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic> species, there are seven pilin-like proteins, so-called due to their conserved N-terminal PilD cleavage sequences: PilH, PilI, PilJ, PilK, ComP, PilV and PilX (referred to as PilL in <italic>N. gonorrheae</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-WintherLarsen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, <italic>comP</italic>, <italic>pilV</italic> and <italic>pilX</italic> mutants are piliated, so the corresponding proteins are thought to insert in the pilus fiber and mediate specific type IV pili dependent functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-WintherLarsen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Helaine1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-WintherLarsen2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We previously demonstrated the importance of mechanical forces generated by the bloodstream on the process of pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Mairey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In the bloodstream, shear stress levels vary between 5 and 100 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> with values reaching 40 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> in capillary networks commonly colonized by <italic>N. meningtidis</italic> during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Pries1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Initial binding to host cells is strongly inhibited by shear stress and can only occur in capillaries where shear stress occasionally decreases to values below 0.5 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> for short periods of time before increasing back to values around 40 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>. After initial binding, bacteria proliferate on the cell surface and form large microcolonies strikingly resistant to high external forces generated by the bloodstream. These microcolonies eventually fill the entire lumen of the capillaries and could strongly affect the barrier function of the endothelium. The ability of these large bacterial colonies to resist blood flow on the surface of endothelial cells in brain capillaries is therefore a probable determining factor in subsequent crossing of the BBB. The mechanical environment of microcolonies is also important during nasopharynx colonization. Bacterial microcolonies forming on the epithelium are exposed to high levels of shear stress due to mucus flow, sneezing and coughing.</p><p>Like several extracellular pathogens including Group A <italic>Streptococci</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Cywes1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>Bartonella spp.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Dehio1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> triggers a local remodeling of the eukaryotic cell membrane.

We first show that bacterial auto-aggregation is insufficient to explain the mechanical resistance of microcolonies growing on the host cell surface. Pharmacological compounds targeting specific cellular functions were then used to identify processes involved in increasing microcolony cohesion. Finally we identified bacterial factors involved in triggering the cellular response underlying the increased mechanical resistance of microcolonies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Type IV pili&#x02013;dependent bacterial autoaggregative properties are insufficient to explain the mechanical resistance of microcolonies growing on the cellular surface</title><p>We previously showed that <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> growing in tight bacterial aggregates on eukaryotic cellular surfaces are highly resistant to external forces exerted by the harsh conditions found in the nasopharynx or in the bloodstream <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Mairey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. As this property of meningococci is likely to be a determining factor of nasopharynx colonization and pathogenesis we undertook to further explore its molecular basis. When proliferating in suspension, <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> form bacterial aggregates of different sizes, spontaneously and independently of the adhesion to host cells; this process depends on type IV pili. Our first hypothesis was therefore that bacteria-bacteria interactions could explain the mechanical resistance of bacterial colonies growing on the cellular surface. To test this we compared cohesive forces involved in bacterial aggregates growing on the cellular surface <italic>vs.</italic> forces for aggregates growing in suspension by studying their rupture under controlled shear stress.</p><p>Bacteria were exposed to shear stress in a laminar flow chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000314-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Mairey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. GFP-expressing bacteria were allowed to grow on cells until they formed microcolonies, at which point mechanical force was introduced with liquid flow. As expected, shear stress could be increased to 10 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> for a period of 5 min without any sign of detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000314-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, compare left and right panels). To quantify the effect of flow, bacteria growing on cells were collected and plated to determine the number of colony forming units (CFU, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000314-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The number of CFUs did not change after the introduction of flow. Bacterial colonies were in fact resistant to shear stress levels of 100 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>, a value which represents the highest forces operating in large blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000314-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Under the assumption that bacteria behave as spherical beads, it can be estimated that a shear stress of 100 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> exerts a force of about 300 pN on a single bacterium, or 30 nN on a 10 &#x000b5;m wide colony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Goldman1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Bacteria were grown in suspension under conditions allowing the formation of aggregates of various sizes, similar to those found on the surface of human cells (7&#x02013;15 &#x000b5;m in diameter). Under the same conditions, a mutant lacking type IV pili did not form any aggregates (not shown). Introduction of 10 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> dramatically decreased the number of aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000314-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, compare left and right panels). To quantify the effect, the size distribution of the aggregates was then determined microscopically by automatic image analysis. In absence of shear stress, aggregates ranged over a wide size distribution with the smallest aggregates involving only a few bacteria and others occasionally reaching sizes up to 10,000 bacteria. For further analysis we limited our analysis to a window of sizes between 500 and 5000 bacteria to match aggregate sizes found on the cell surface. Such suspensions of bacterial aggregates were submitted to different levels of shear stress varying between 2.5 and 10 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> and the number of aggregates was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000314-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Shear stress levels as low as 2.5 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> were sufficient to significantly affect the number of aggregates in the suspension and the effect increased with the intensity of shear.

As a comparison, the effect of shear stress on aggregates formed by the <italic>pilT</italic> mutant was determined. The <italic>pilT</italic> mutant is characterized by a defect in pilus retraction, bacteria are hyperpiliated and the <italic>pilT</italic> strain forms aggregates that are unusually large and numerous.

In the case of wild type bacteria, and in contrast to the <italic>pilV</italic> mutant, every bacterium in the aggregate has the opportunity to directly come into contact with the host cells through the bacteria-induced projections. Reorganization of the host cell plasma membrane induced by the bacteria would therefore stabilize the adhesion of additional bacteria. To describe this collective behavior we propose the term &#x0201c;cooperative adhesion&#x0201d;, to convey the sense that initial adhesion triggers the host cell structural rearrangement that allows subsequent bacteria to adhere in a mechanically resistant microcolony.</p><p>An important implication is that the process known as bacterial adhesion is in fact a multistep process. A first consequence of the present findings is that before adhesion, bacteria proliferating in suspension in the bloodstream cannot form aggregates simply because of level of shear stress. In the bloodstream, shear stress levels range between 10 and 100 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>, and already at 10 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> bacterial aggregates disassemble. In the blood, initial attachment therefore likely takes place with individual bacteria or possibly small aggregates. Adhesion starts with the establishment of contact with the host cells by pioneer diplococci followed by proliferation with the formation of aggregates through bacteria-bacteria contacts and concomitantly the induction of cellular projections that maintain direct contact between bacteria and host cells and thus strengthen cohesion. Interestingly certain of these steps can be genetically distinguished, as the <italic>pilV</italic> mutant is only deficient for the step involving the strengthening of microcolony cohesion whereas mutants such as <italic>pilC1</italic> are deficient for the initial attachment step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Mairey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Previous work showed the importance of <italic>Neisseria spp.</italic> type IV pili in triggering a cellular response. Pilus retraction has been implicated in triggering host cell response as a <italic>pilT</italic> mutant exhibits decreased signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Merz1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. From the biophysical point of view it is important to note that the forces created by pilus retraction are in the same range than the forces generated by shear stress if one considers that several pili bundles are involved in contacts with each host cell. According to Goldman <italic>et al.</italic>, under flow-generated shear stress, a rough estimate of the force exerted on a 10 &#x000b5;m wide colony at 100 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup> would be 30 nN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Goldman1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas a single pilus bundle can exert forces in the 1 nN range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Biais1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations prompted us to evaluate the mechanical resistance of aggregates formed by the retraction deficient <italic>pilT</italic> strain. We show here that in contrast to the wild type strain, application of shear stress to <italic>pilT</italic> mutant aggregates does not lead to their disruption. This result highlights the unusual properties of <italic>pilT</italic> aggregates and explains why despite a decreased cellular response, <italic>pilT</italic> aggregates growing on a cellular surface are resistant to shear stress. Absence of detachment in the presence of shear stress could also be due to the fact that the effect of the <italic>pilT</italic> mutation on bacteria-induced cellular response is less pronounced than the <italic>pilV</italic> mutation. However, pretreatment of cells with M&#x000df;CD and infection with the <italic>pilT</italic> mutant led to the formation of shear stress resistant colonies (data not shown) confirming that aggregative properties of the <italic>pilT</italic> mutant are sufficient to explain the absence of detachment upon shear stress application.</p><p>Here we show that deletion of a single pilin-like protein PilV severely affects signaling although retraction and twitching motility are not affected in this mutant (not shown and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-WintherLarsen2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>). Pilin-like proteins are thought to insert in the pilus fiber primarily composed of the major pilin PilE. Three such proteins are described in the <italic>Neisseria spp.</italic>, PilX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Helaine1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, ComP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Wolfgang2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and PilV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-WintherLarsen2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Colocalization of the protein with the pilus fiber has been demonstrated directly for PilX by imunogold labeling and electron microscopy and this protein is necessary for bacteria-bacteria aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Helaine1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Helaine2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. ComP is necessary for the natural competence of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>, probably for the initial step of DNA uptake. In <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, it was found that the <italic>pilV</italic> mutant is deficient for adhesion although shear stress was not applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-WintherLarsen2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This apparent discrepancy with our results could be due to a difference between bacterial species or to reproducible differences in experimental technique. We found that fixing samples with glutaraldehyde, as was done in the Winter-Larsen <italic>et al.</italic> study, rendered microcolonies formed by the <italic>N. meningitidis pilV</italic> mutant sensitive to washing procedures, suggesting although not proving the two organisms do manifest the same <italic>pilV</italic>-related properties. We found that in the absence of PilV in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, type IV pili are unable to trigger efficient reorganization of the host cell membrane. Our results do not formally exclude the possibility that in addition to its defect in inducing a cellular response, the <italic>pilV</italic> mutant also has an aggregation defect revealed by the application of mechanical stress. Further biophysical studies will be needed to address this point. The simplest model to explain the role of PilV in the induction of the cellular response, is that PilV integrates in the pilus fiber outside of the bacterial body and interacts with a receptor on the cellular surface, which in turn stimulates a cellular signaling pathway leading to the reorganization of the cellular surface. Current efforts are focused on demonstrating this direct relationship and identifying a target receptor.</p><p>The signaling pathway triggered by type IV pili leading to the formation of cellular protrusions displays distinct properties from the classical pathway for actin-dependent filopodia formation. The actin cytoskeleton has been shown to participate in the pili-dependent process but inhibition of filamentous actin with cytochalasin D or Latrunculin A does not reduce the ability of bacteria to recruit Ezrin or to trigger the formation of cellular projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Eugene1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and data not shown). Although it is difficult to formally exclude a role for the actin cytoskeleton in the <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>-induced cellular response, our results do suggest that this bacterium takes advantage of unusual cellular pathways to initiate the response. Consistent with its lack of effect on the bacteria-induced cellular projections, cytochalasin D did not render microcolonies sensitive to mechanical stress (data not shown). In contrast, we show here that removing cholesterol from the plasma membrane has a strong effect on the ability of the bacteria to trigger a response and that cholesterol is abundantly recruited below bacterial microcolonies. The recruitment of CD44 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Eugene1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, src kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Hoffmann1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and ezrin under microcolonies also supports a role for lipid microdomains, as these proteins are typically found in these structures. Interestingly, lipid rafts are known to be necessary for a growing list of signal transduction pathways, some of which could be involved in the bacteria-induced process investigated here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Simons1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively the effect of cholesterol depletion could be through a modification of the biophysical properties of the membrane. In any case, several pathogens are known to interact with lipid rafts at different stages during the course of pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Lafont1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Related to this study, rafts are also important for the initial adhesion of individual bacteria, for instance in the case of the Internalin A-dependent interaction of <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> with host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Seveau1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> or the example of the initial interaction of <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> with host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Lafont2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In other instances, rafts were found to be necessary for invasion of host cells or for intracellular survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Lafont1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Interaction of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> with endothelial cells is a new illustration of how bacteria have evolved to exploit host cell function. Intracellular bacteria are known to directly divert cellular pathways to generate a safe niche for the bacteria. In the case of extracellular bacteria such as <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, adhesion is generally viewed as a passive process reduced to adhesin-receptor interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Dumenil1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results show that even in the case of extracellular bacteria, an intense dialogue takes place with host cells and that the nature of this dialogue influences the properties of the interaction. Interestingly <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> is not the only pathogen to induce the formation of cellular protrusions while proliferating on the cellular surface. The Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (group A Streptococcus) responsible for streptococcal sore throat and invasive soft tissue infection was also found to induce the formation of cellular projections while proliferating at the epithelial surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Cywes1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Another example is <italic>Bartonella henselae</italic>, a Gram-negative bacillus responsible for the formation of tumors on the skin surface characterized by proliferating endothelial cells associated with clumps of bacteria. Colonization of endothelial cells by aggregates of <italic>B. henselae</italic> is associated with the formation of cellular projections closely resembling those observed with <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Dehio1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to other apicomplexans, the parasite Cryptosporidium resides in an extracytoplasmic parasitophorous vacuole on the cellular surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Borowski1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. After adhesion, long and thick microvilli that cluster around developing trophozoites are analogous to the cellular projections induced by N. meningitidis. Furthermore, host cell membrane reorganization and attachment is also dependent on lipid microdomains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Nelson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The &#x0201c;pericellular&#x0201d; lifestyle adopted by <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> could be a general process adopted by various pathogens. It will be of interest to test whether certain viruses could also utilize a similar strategy. In any case our results provide a framework for the analysis of the functional significance of pathogen-induced host cell membrane reorganization: these cellular responses provide mechanical resistance to the harsh conditions encountered by extracellular pathogens in their hosts.</p><p>From the evolutionary point of view, properties of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> are positively selected to favor their life in the nasopharynx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000314-Taha1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> and certain of these properties then play an important role in the context of pathogenesis. Processes described here can be viewed as the result of such evolutionary pressure. Under pressure to survive in the nasopharynx, <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> has evolved a mechanism to maintain adhesion of microcolonies on the epithelial surface despite harsh mechanical conditions. This adaptive feature becomes a key virulence factor when the bacterium enters the blood and adheres to the cerebral endothelium before invading the brain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Ezrin was detected using selective rabbit polyclonal antisera kindly provided by P.

We used primers PilV forward primer <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;- A<underline>GAATTC</underline>TACATCCGGCGCGCCCGCCTG -3&#x02032;</named-content> and PilV reverse primer <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;- ATA<underline>CTGCAG</underline>TTAGTCGAAGCCGGGGC-3&#x02032;</named-content>, which contained overhangs corresponding to underlined restriction sites for EcoRI and PstI, respectively. The PCR product was first cloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen, USA) and then excised from pCRII-TOPO with EcoRI and PstI, and subcloned into pMAL-p4x (New England biolabs, USA) already digested by EcoRI and PstI. The final construct contains the coding sequence for maltose binding protein fused upstream and in-frame with the truncated <italic>pilV</italic>. The protein was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21::DE3, purified using maltose-agarose, digested with factor X and submitted to ion exchange chromatography. The protein was injected into New Zealand rabbits (Centre Lago, Vonnas, France). For western blot detection, anti-PilV serum was diluted 1/2000 in PBS containing 0.1&#x00025; Tween20 and 1&#x00025; milk, secondary antibody HRP-linked anti IgG antibodies was diluted in the same buffer 1/10000. Detection of immobilized antigens was performed by chemiluminescence using ECL Plus detection reagents (Amersham biosciences).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000314.s001"><label>Video S1</label><caption><p>Video microscopy analysis of the resistance of microcolonies formed by a wild type strain of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> on endothelial cells.
