As the ultimate goal is to achieve successful implantation of a single high quality embryo, much effort has been invested in the search for and validation of reliable non-invasive techniques for assessing embryo quality.</p><p>Embryos for embryo transfer (ET) are routinely selected after 2 to 5 days of cultivation using one of a several embryo quality scoring systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Embryo quality is generally determined by cleavage rate, regularity of blastomeres and a low degree of fragmentation. Originally, embryos for transfer were chosen on the basis of their cleavage stage morphology, such as the number and equality of blastomeres, or the presence and grade of fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A non-invasive embryo quality scoring system based on the timing of the first cleavage was introduced by Shoukir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and Sakkas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Zygotes which reached the first mitotic division between 25 and 27 hours after insemination, called Early Cleavage (EC) embryos, exhibited more than twice the pregnancy rate and three times the implantation rate compared to non-EC (NEC) embryos.</p><p>Meanwhile Tesarik and Greco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] reported that IVF outcome could be predicted from morphological examination of human zygotes. They classified zygotes into 6 different patterns (0 &#x02013; 5) based on size and on the number and distribution of nucleoli or their precursors. This system is somewhat impractical for routine use, particularly in a busy IVF laboratory, because it has a very detailed classification and therefore is too time consuming. Consequently, various simplified zygote scoring systems emerged after this publication, using either the number and position of nucleolar precursor bodies (NPB) or nucleoli, or the alignment of NPB which was classified as either polarized or non-polarized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>There is still no consensus on which of these scoring systems best predicts pregnancy outcome, though several studies including our preliminary ones have demonstrated the benefits of introducing the EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] or a combination of EC and pronuclear morphology scoring systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] into clinical practice. Our retrospective study aims to confirm these observations. The outcome parameters evaluated include biochemical pregnancy rate (bPR), clinical pregnancy rate (cPR) and implantation rate (IR) for each of the scoring systems used for the selection of embryos for ET.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Stimulation protocols</title><p>Evaluation included 364 IVF cycles in women under the age of 39 at our infertility centre between the years of 2004 to 2006. The main causes of infertility of the couples were male factor (39% of cases) followed by tubal factor (35% of cases), either alone or in combination with other factors. The majority of patients (n = 292) underwent a long follicular depot stimulation protocol. GnRH agonists were applied on Day 1 or 2 of the menstrual cycle, followed by an individualized stimulation with recombinant FSH (rFSH) after achieving down-regulation. Oocyte maturation by hCG was induced when at least 1 follicle reached 20 mm diameter and at least two others were larger than 17 mm. In the remaining 72 patients the stimulation protocol with 100 mg of clomiphene citrate per day from the 3<sup>rd </sup>to the 7<sup>th </sup>day of the cycle and hMG or rFSH administration according to individual response in follicular development were used. When two or more follicles reached a diameter of &#x02265; 18 mm, final oocyte maturation was induced by hCG. In both protocols oocytes were retrieved 36 h later by ultrasound-guided ovum pick-up. Oocytes were fertilized by conventional IVF (n = 96), ICSI (n = 239) or mixed IVF/ICSI (n = 29). Embryo transfer was performed on day 3 of cultivation. Since 2004, the evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in ejaculate by the chemiluminescence method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] has been included in the routine semen evaluation. None of the subjects who entered the study after introducing ROS measurement had excessive ROS levels.

The contemporary tendency is to decrease the number of transferred embryos to prevent multiple pregnancies while still achieving an acceptable success rate. The ultimate goal is to transfer, whenever possible, only one top quality embryo. Therefore much effort has been invested in the search for a suitable non-invasive method of scoring embryo quality. Besides improving outcome parameters, recognizing high quality embryos may save pointless costs of cryopreserving low quality embryos, some of which may be damaged due to oxidative stress and/or other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In the hands of an experienced embryologist, both zygote and EC scoring and morphological evaluation of embryos require only basic laboratory equipment and are therefore well suited for routine clinical use. Unfortunately, data derived from <italic>in vitro </italic>cultured human embryos suggest that the quality of embryos often changes from day to day. Top quality zygotes may become low quality embryos after <italic>in vitro </italic>cultivation and <italic>vice versa </italic>and with this in mind we have retrospectively evaluated the merits of these two scoring systems individually and in combination.</p><p>There is no consensus yet on the preference of these two basic scoring systems. In our earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] some benefits of introducing the EC scoring systems into clinical practice were shown. Later we implemented the pronuclear zygote morphology for evaluation of embryo quality. In the group where embryos were transferred according to their pronuclear zygote morphology no difference in outcome parameters between pattern "0" and "other" pattern embryos (cPR 46% versus 46% and IR 35% versus 30%) was found, even though there were significantly more embryos transferred in the "other" pattern group. This is in line with observations by Salumets et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] who did not find any significant differences in implantation and pregnancy rates between the different pronuclear zygote morphology patterns after the elective single embryo transfer. Similarly, James et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] found no correlation between zygote morphology and live birth rate. On the other hand, a significant difference in IR with regard to the polarization of NPB was found by Lukaszuk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Nagy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] observed a strong correlation between polarization of the NPB in both pronuclei and faster cleavage when the evaluation was done earlier than usual, as little as 15 hrs after insemination. The timing of evaluation may have an important effect. It has been shown that pronuclear morphology changes over time as the number of small pronuclear precursor's declines when they merge into larger nucleoli, with polarization of NPB in both pronuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Our present study confirmed the greater predictive value of the EC embryo quality scoring system as compared to pronuclear zygote morphology. Significantly better outcome parameters for clinical pregnancy rate (56% versus 38%) and for implantation rate (38% versus 27%) were achieved after transfers of EC embryos compared to NEC embryos. The possibility that early embryo cleavage, a highly significant biological indicator of embryo growth potential, may predict IVF outcome was first proposed by Shoukir et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and Sakkas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Lundin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] also showed that early cleavage was a strong independent predictor of birth, especially after ICSI procedures. In a study which included analysis of 178 elective single embryo transfers Salumets et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] also showed that EC embryos possess a significantly higher developmental competence than NEC embryos. One of the mechanisms that determine the speed of embryo development may be the quality of the spermatozoon, as was suggested by Chen and Kattera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The best outcome in terms of pregnancy rate (56%) and implantation rate (43%) in our study was found when only Pattern "0" and EC embryos were used for transfer in spite of the lower average number of transferred embryos (1.5). This observation is supported by Petersen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] who used similar combined criteria for embryo quality. In 36 patients where 100% implantation rate was achieved, 82% of transferred embryos had optimal zygote morphology and cleaved early.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The ultimate goal of multiple pregnancy prevention in IVF is elective single embryo transfer. This trend stimulates further research in refining methods to assess embryos with the best implantation potential. Our results indicate that early cleavage is a better independent marker of implantation potential than zygote morphology. But the best outcome can be achieved if both embryo scoring systems are used jointly and the embryo is classified as EC and Pattern "0".</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JB designed the study, carried out all embryo evaluation and selection for transfer, provided data collection and drafted the manuscript; IO selected the stimulation protocols, provided clinical information, performed embryo transfers and coordinated the study; MS participated in the daily routine embryology; HF supervised the manuscript design, language corrections and prepared data for statistical evaluation and gave final approval.
