In 2008, the estimated 5-year relative survival rate for MBC is 27% which compares favorably to rates in stage IV lung (3%) and pancreatic cancers (1%). Despite these advances, MBC remains an incurable disease, often associated with many symptoms and a decreased quality of life (QoL). Therefore, therapy goals in the treatment of MBC include prolonging both progression-free survival and overall survival rates, while at the same time improving QoL by palliation of symptoms. Therefore, systemic chemotherapy ideally should not induce unnecessary toxicities. Once chemotherapy is indicated, a number of drugs and regimens are available but only a few offer both palliation of symptoms (responses to therapy) and overall survival benefit. The addition of novel biologic compounds to chemotherapy has been shown in phase III trials to improve all the above mentioned clinical outcomes in MBC. This review will discuss data supporting the use of gemcitabine/taxane combinations in the treatment of MBC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>metastatic breast cancer</kwd><kwd>gemcitabine</kwd><kwd>taxanes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer remains a major public health problem for women. For 2008, in the US alone, there are estimated to be 180,460 new cases of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-tcrm-4-1157">Jemal et al 2008</xref>). Despite many advances in the treatment of breast cancer, it remains the second most common cause of cancer related mortality with 40,480 estimated deaths to occur this year alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-tcrm-4-1157">Jemal et al 2008</xref>). Although metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains largely incurable, as is the case in most other advanced solid tumors, improvements in systemic chemotherapy and endocrine therapy have prolonged the average life expectancy of patients with MBC. Estimated 5-year relative survival rate for MBC is 27% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-tcrm-4-1157">Jemal et al 2008</xref>). While not as good as the 5-year rates for stage IV testicular cancer (70%), which in many cases is curable with systemic chemotherapy, in comparison with survival rates for lung (3%) and pancreatic cancers (1.7%), MBC is a very treatable disease. In all patients regardless of HER-2/neu or hormone receptor status, chemotherapy remains an important component of the treatment of MBC. Taxane-nucleoside analog combinations remain among the most active drugs for the treatment of MBC and have been shown in randomized phase III trials to be superior to single agent therapy in anthracycline-pretreated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-tcrm-4-1157">O&#x02019;Shaughnessy et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-4-1157">Albain et al 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Gemcitabine and rationale for combination over single-agent therapy in MBC</title><p>The nucleoside analog gemcitabine (2&#x02019;, 2&#x02019;-difluoro-deoxycytidine) is activated intracellularly by phosphorylation into di- and tri-phosphates by the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase. The tri phosphate form of gemcitabine competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate for incorporation into DNA and the di-phosphate form inhibits ribonucleotide reductase inhibiting DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-tcrm-4-1157">Huang et al 1991</xref>). Once incorporated, it determines fragmentation with consequent cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-tcrm-4-1157">Plunkett et al 1995</xref>). Gemcitabine has significant clinical activity in MBC and other solid tumors. Results from a recent phase III randomized trial demonstrated that gemcitabine in combination with paclitaxel as first-line therapy in MBC resulted in significant improvements in both median overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) over that of paclitaxel alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-4-1157">Albain et al 2008</xref>).

By contrast, the E1193 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-tcrm-4-1157">Sledge et al 2003</xref>), while showing significant improvements in overall response rates (ORR) and time to treatment failure with combining doxorubicin and paclitaxel, this did not translate into a significant difference in TTP and OS compared to either drug alone in a sequential fashion. This study was instrumental in changed practice early 2000s: the preferential treatment of MBC was single sequential use of drugs. This changed substantially when the combination of capecitabine and docetaxel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-tcrm-4-1157">O&#x02019;Shaughnessy et al 2002</xref>) and gemcitabine and paclitaxel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-4-1157">Albain et al 2008</xref>) were presented and published both demonstrating the advantage in response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. The latter study demonstrated considerably less adverse toxicities thus making it the preferred chemotherapy combination regimen for first-line MBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-tcrm-4-1157">Moinpour et al 2004</xref>).</p><p>However, despite the superiority of taxane-nucleoside analog combinations, there are several clinical situations where single agent therapy would be preferable to combination therapy in MBC which we will also discuss in this review.</p></sec><sec><title>Rationale for non-anthracycline-containing regimens in MBC</title><p>The widespread use of anthracyclines in the adjuvant setting, coupled with their cardiac and leukemogenic toxicities, has warranted the investigation of non-anthracycline alternatives. Non-anthracycline regimens are being studied in comparison with anthracycline-containing regimens in MBC and have been shown to be equal in efficacy. An example of one such study is the combination of capecitabine/paclitaxel (XP), which was compared with epirubicin/paclitaxel (EP). The results showed that the median PFS for EP was 11.8 months vs 12.3 months for XP (p = ns). There was no difference in OS. Response rates were 41% for EP and 41.5% for XP, supporting the argument that non-anthracycline-containing regimens are at least as effective as anthracycline-containing regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-tcrm-4-1157">L&#x000fc;ck et al 2007</xref>). In this article we will review currently available data in the treatment of MBC with gemcitabine in combination with docetaxel, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel. We will also review the preclinical evidence supporting the use of gemcitabine/taxane combinations in the clinical setting of MBC.</p></sec><sec><title>Single-agent gemcitabine in MBC</title><sec><title>Phase II data</title><p>Monotherapy with gemcitabine has been studied in many phase II studies with reported ORR between 14% and 37% as first-line therapy, and approximately 12% and 30% as second-line therapy after prior taxanes or anthracyclines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-tcrm-4-1157">Silvestris et al 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Gemcitabine and taxanes</title><p>Taxanes are a class of drugs that do not have overlapping side effects with gemcitabine and hence combinations of these agents with gemcitabine are feasible.

In the second-line setting, gemcitabine/paclitaxel had a response rate of 45% to 55% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-tcrm-4-1157">Murad et al 2001</xref>). A phase II study by S&#x000e1;nchez-Rovira used biweekly combination of doxorubicin at 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (day 1), paclitaxel at 135 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (day 2), and gemcitabine at 2500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (day 2 after paclitaxel) administered biweekly in a 28-day cycle for 6 cycles has been shown to have ORR of 83% with median TTP of 13.9 months as first-line therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase III registration trial</title><p>Based on the response rates and safety data, a phase III study was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-4-1157">Albain et al (2008)</xref> comparing gemcitabine/paclitaxel with paclitaxel alone. Ninety-eight centers in 19 countries participated in this trial and enrolled 529 patients with unresectable, locally recurrent, or measurable MBC. Patients were randomized to receive paclitaxel (175 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on day 1 or paclitaxel (175 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on day 1 with gemcitabine (1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on days 1 and 8 every 21 days until disease progression. The primary endpoint was OS; secondary endpoints included TTP, ORR, and safety. The vast majority of enrolled patients had received prior adjuvant anthracyclines (96% in each arm). All those who had received prior adjuvant taxanes or prior therapy for MBC were ineligible. Patients had a median age of 53 years (range 23&#x02013;83), and most patients had metastatic (97% per arm) and visceral disease (73% per arm). Based on the interim results in May 2004, the US FDA approved the combination of gemcitabine/paclitaxel for first-line therapy in MBC in patients who had received prior anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The final results of this study were recently published. Demographic data in each were similar with a median age of 53 years. Gemcitabine was associated with significantly improved median OS (18.6 months vs 15.8 months; p = 0.048), median TTP (6.1 months vs 4.0 months; p = 0.00002), and ORR (41.4% vs 11.5% p = 0.00002), compared with paclitaxel. Toxicity data shows that hematologic toxicities, especially grade 3&#x02013;4 neutropenia was worse in the combination (47.9% vs 11.5%) and thrombocytopenia. However, febrile neutropenia rates were low in both arms (&#x02264;5%). The combination had manageable non-hematological toxicities that were higher in the gemcitabine arm (fatigue, motor neuropathy, and elevation of transaminases). Dose reductions were 8% for gemcitabine and 8% for paclitaxel in the combination arm and 2% in the paclitaxel arm. Gemcitabine was omitted in 7% in the gemcitabine arm compared with less than 1% in paclitaxel arm. Fourteen percent in the paclitaxel arm went on to receive gemcitabine as part of subsequent therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-4-1157">Albain et al 2008</xref>). Another very important aspect was that quality of life (QoL) as measured by Rotterdam Symptom checklist Score was significantly improved with combination chemotherapy than with single agent paclitaxel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-tcrm-4-1157">Moinpour et al 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Gemcitabine and docetaxel</title><sec><title>Phase II studies</title><p>Published phase II data with gemcitabine and docetaxel report objective response rates of 59% to 79%, and median TTP between 8.5 and 11 months in the first-line setting.

Patients with MBC who had received prior anthracyclines either in the adjuvant or metastatic setting were randomized to receive either gemcitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (days 1 and 8) plus docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (day 1) [GD] or capecitabine 1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily (days 1&#x02013;14) plus docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (day 1) every 3 weeks [XD]. The primary endpoint of this randomized trial was PFS. Secondary endpoints included: safety, QoL, OS, and ORR. Patients were stratified based on: first- or second-line therapy for metastatic disease, presence or absence of visceral metastasis, and prior taxane therapy. Arms were well balanced; median age was 55 years; 86% had visceral involvement; 81% had &#x02265;2 metastatic sites; 67% were ER/PR+; 17% were HER2 over-expressed; 17% received prior taxane; 34% received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. There was no statistically significant difference in both the arms for efficacy or adverse effects. PFS was 8.2 months in both arms and ORR was 32%. There was also no difference whether the drugs were used in first- or second-line settings. Hematological toxicities were similar including febrile neutropenia (8% vs 13%), grade 3&#x02013;4 neutropenia (85% vs 82%). Grade 3&#x02013;4 thrombocytopenia was more common with GD (11% vs 3%). Overall, there were significantly greater grade 3&#x02013;4 non-hematologic toxicities with XD than GD including: diarrhea (17% vs 7%), hand-foot syndrome (26% vs 0%), and mucositis (17% vs 4%), respectively. It is likely that the dose of capecitabine explains the excess of non-hematologic toxicities with XD in this trial. Although the approved dose of capecitabine is 1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, it is quite rarely used in clinical practice at these doses, particularly in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-tcrm-4-1157">Chan et al 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-tcrm-4-1157">Rossi et al (2007)</xref> showed that lower and better-tolerated doses of capecitabine show similar activity to the FDA-approved dose of 2500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given daily for 2 of 3 weeks.</p><p>A QoL analysis of the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-tcrm-4-1157">Chan et al (2005)</xref> was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-tcrm-4-1157">Fumoleau et al (2006)</xref> using the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL).

The investigators assessed response independently of treating physician. RECIST criteria were used. Three patients received nab-paclitaxel and bevacizumab at the following doses: nab-P 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, B 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and 3 patients also received gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; all 3 drugs were given every 2 weeks.

Median time to progression is 13.7 months, whereas median survival was not reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-tcrm-4-1157">Fountzilas et al 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Scheduling of gemcitabine/taxanes</title><p>The optimal biologic dosing schedule for taxanes and nucleoside analogues is still unclear. Results from several preclinical studies have suggested that the administration of paclitaxel prior to gemcitabine results in an increase in the 2&#x02019;,2&#x02019;-difluoro-deoxycytidine-5&#x02019;triphosphate, the active metabolite of gemcitabine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-tcrm-4-1157">Kroep et al 2000</xref>). In another preclinical study performed in breast cancer cell lines it was shown that when gemcitabine was administered 48 hours after doxorubicin/paclitaxel combination, there was synergism. The explanation was that doxorubicin/paclitaxel causes G2-M phase block and that the cells re-enter the cell-cycle 8 hours after paclitaxel administration, and as they enter G-S phase, gemcitabine exerts its cytotoxic activity. Based on these preclinical observations, paclitaxel followed by gemcitabine is the most commonly used sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-tcrm-4-1157">Zoli et al 1999</xref>).</p><p>The majority of gemcitabine/taxane regimens in MBC use every-3-week cycles. However, it had been shown that if chemotherapy could be given more frequently at the same or lower dose, it would lead to higher responses and greater cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-tcrm-4-1157">Fornier and Norton 2005</xref>). In the adjuvant setting, it is widely accepted that every-2-week dose dense chemotherapy with filgrastim support improves disease-free survival and improved tolerability, with less neutropenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-tcrm-4-1157">Citron et al 2003</xref>). A phase II study was conducted to evaluate gemcitabine (2500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1) and paclitaxel (150 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1) with or without prophylactic filgrastim (G-CSF). Forty-three patients were enrolled. An ORR of 78% was observed and 11 patients had CR (26%) and, most interestingly, G-CSF was not required for this combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-tcrm-4-1157">Colomer et al 2004</xref>). A lower response rate (59%) was obtained when the dose of gemcitabine was reduced to 1500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in combination with docetaxel in a phase II study, suggesting that a lower dose of gemcitabine every 2 weeks may be too low for an effective anti-tumor effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-tcrm-4-1157">Pelegri et al 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Alternative dosing of gemcitabine/taxanes</title><p>A phase II randomized trial comparing three regimens was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-tcrm-4-1157">Khoo et al (2004)</xref>. The study compared paclitaxel given on days 1 and 8 with the standard regimen of every 3 weeks and with docetaxel given on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. A total of 8 cycles were administered and prophylactic G-CSF was not routinely allowed. Efficacy was similar between each gemcitabine/taxane combination and toxicity was similar for paclitaxel given weekly or once every 3 weeks. Anemia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, infectious episodes, and diarrhea were more pronounced in the gemcitabine/docetaxel combination and were associated with higher use of blood transfusions, G-CSF, and antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-tcrm-4-1157">Khoo et al 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Single-agent sequential therapy vs combination therapy: when is one drug enough in MBC?</title><p>Despite emerging evidence that combination chemotherapy, including here a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, eg, bevacizumab and trastuzumab, there are situations when single-agent sequential therapy would be more appropriate in MBC and clearly 2 or 3 drugs are &#x0201c;too much&#x0201d;: (i) poor performance status patients and/or elderly or non-elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities that would increase the likelihood of adverse toxicities with combination chemotherapy; (ii) patients with rather minimal signs or symptoms and/or with few metastasitc sites, who are thus asymptomatic from their disease. Consequently, in these situations single sequential drug use would have less propensity for adverse toxicities and consequently would help to maintain improved QoL in patients as long as possible.</p><p>Moving specifically to combinations of biologic and targeted agents to gemcitabine-taxane doublets in the treatment of HER-2 unamplified MBC, although many studies are underway only the addition of bevacizumab to weekly paclitaxel has been shown to significantly improve PFS. In the ECOG 2100 randomized phase III trial the addition of bevacizumab to weekly paclitaxel (3 out of 4 weeks) improved PFS by almost 6 months (11.8 vs 5.9 months; p &#x0003c; 0.001) with no difference in OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-tcrm-4-1157">Miller et al 2007</xref>). Many other studies are ongoing, such as the combination of bevacizumab and docetaxel, the combination of paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and bevacizumab, and many others. At this point no phase III data are available to indicate whether the addition of gemcitabine to a bevacizumab/taxane doublet as first-line therapy for HER-2 unamplified MBC results in superior clinical outcomes. Therefore, the treating medical oncologist should have an open discussion with the patient to determine the goals of therapy and the limitations of the current clinical data. Nevertheless, there are certain situations where it may be reasonable to recommend combination bevacizumab/taxane chemotherapy with or without gemcitabine for first-line treatment of HER-2 unamplified MBC: (i) patients with more metastatic tumor burden; (ii) symptomatic patients; (iii) triple negative disease; (iv) younger age; (v) other poor prognostic factors, eg, &#x0003e;5 circulating tumor cells, short interval between adjuvant therapy, and diagnosis of MBC. Subsequent lines of treatment would probably be equivalently treated with a single sequential approach as in the past unless new data emerge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite recent advances in chemotherapeutic agents for MBC, it is still an incurable disease and the purpose of chemotherapy remains that of relieving symptoms and improving QoL. It is also widely realized that response rates do sometimes correlate with survival and hence rational drug combinations for effective cytotoxicity with good tolerability are essential for the management of MBC. The combination of gemcitabine and taxanes is an effective regimen that is well tolerated with good response rates, as illustrated in this review. This is all the more true in anthracycline-resistant or anthracycline-refractory cases. The combination of gemcitabine/paclitaxel has been approved by the FDA for MBC and the other two combinations (gemcitabine/docetaxel and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel) are also reasonable alternatives given the phase II data reviewed in this article.</p><p>We can conclude that a gemcitabine/taxane combination is very promising and in one study has shown an overall survival advantage. Other gemcitabine/taxane combinations with agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor need to be further explored in phase III trials. We can also conclude that the era of single-agent sequential therapy for MBC is over for many patients, based on several studies showing superiority. It remains to be seen in what sequence these drug combinations used in first-, second-, third-, and fourth-line settings offers the best potential for time to progression, response rates, and survival while preserving QoL.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>AJM is on the speakers&#x02019; bureau for Eli Lilly, Abraxis Oncology, and Veridex.
