Following review of the existing literature the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency required a rigorous investigation conducted under standardized procedures. <italic>X. laevis</italic> tadpoles were exposed to atrazine at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 25, or 100 &#x003bc;g/l from day 8 postfertilization (dpf) until completion of metamorphosis or dpf 83, whichever came first. Nearly identical experiments were performed in two independent laboratories: experiment 1 at Wildlife International, Ltd. and experiment 2 at the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB). Both experiments employed optimized animal husbandry procedures and environmental conditions in validated flow-through exposure systems. The two experiments demonstrated consistent survival, growth, and development of <italic>X. laevis</italic> tadpoles, and all measured parameters were within the expected ranges and were comparable in negative control and atrazine-treated groups. Atrazine, at concentrations up to 100 &#x003bc;g/l, had no effect in either experiment on the percentage of males or the incidence of mixed sex as determined by histological evaluation. In contrast, exposure of larval <italic>X. laevis</italic> to 0.2 &#x003bc;g 17&#x003b2;-estradiol/l as the positive control resulted in gonadal feminization. Instead of an even distribution of male and female phenotypes, percentages of males:females:mixed sex were 19:75:6 and 22:60:18 in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. These studies demonstrate that long-term exposure of larval <italic>X. laevis</italic> to atrazine at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 &#x003bc;g/l does not affect growth, larval development, or sexual differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>atrazine</kwd><kwd>amphibians</kwd><kwd>endocrine</kwd><kwd>sexual differentiation</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-<italic>s</italic>-triazine) is a widely used triazine herbicide that inhibits photosynthesis in plants and algae. The ecotoxicity profile of atrazine has been well characterized and a recent comprehensive, probabilistic risk assessment concluded that direct effects on aquatic animals were very unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Giddings <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Although atrazine has been reported to affect sexual development and gonadal differentiation in the African clawed frog, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, the results of different studies have been inconsistent. One report indicated that exposure of <italic>Xenopus</italic> larvae to concentrations of atrazine ranging from 0.1 to 200 &#x003bc;g/l (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hayes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) caused 16&#x02013;20% of the males (subsequently revised as 32&#x02013;40% in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hayes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) to form multiple gonads. Other gonadal findings were reported as indicative of adverse development such as decreased ovarian melanophores. In a single dose study with a nominal atrazine concentration of 21 &#x003bc;g/l, histological effects on gonads were reported in both male and female <italic>X. laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tavera-Mendoza <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Carr <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref> reported a significant increase in intersex animals and discontinuous gonads at 25 &#x003bc;g atrazine/l, however, re-evaluation of the morphological findings by histology confirmed that neither intersex, defined as ovarian and testicular tissue present as separate structures within an animal, or mixed sex, defined as ovarian and testicular tissue present within the same gonad occurred in that study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epa.gov/oscpmont/sap/meetings/2007/october/transcript2007-10-11.pdf">http://www.epa.gov/oscpmont/sap/meetings/2007/october/transcript2007-10-11.pdf</ext-link>). Further studies concerning potential effects of atrazine on <italic>X. laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hecker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">b</xref>) have not detected any effect on gonads.</p><p>In 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviewed all available pertinent scientific literature to assess potential effects of atrazine on amphibian development and concluded &#x0201c;there is not sufficient scientific evidence to indicate that atrazine consistently produces effects across the range of amphibian species examined&#x0201d; (EPA White Paper on Potential Developmental Effects of Atrazine on Amphibians, FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel, June 17, 2003; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/sap/2003/june/finaljune2002telconfreport.pdf">http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/sap/2003/june/finaljune2002telconfreport.pdf</ext-link>); (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/sap/2003/june/junemeetingreport.pdf">http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/sap/2003/june/junemeetingreport.pdf</ext-link>).</p><p>EPA required that design, methods, and quality limitations exhibited by the existing studies be addressed and additional investigations conducted. To resolve uncertainties and discrepancies among various published reports, a dual-experiment laboratory study to assess potential effects of atrazine on larval development and sexual differentiation in <italic>X. laevis</italic> was conducted. The study was conducted under &#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d; conditions, in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards and utilized validated flow-through exposure systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lutz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Both negative and positive control groups were included in each experiment. Endpoints evaluated histologically included sex ratio, and the prevalence of mixed sex (defined as both gender tissues within a single gonad), intersex (defined as left/right gonads of different gender), and testicular oocytes (testicular ovarian follicles).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The two experiments that constitute the in-life, exposure portion of the study were conducted independently at the facilities of Wildlife International, Ltd. (WLI, MD) and the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB, Berlin, Germany). Experimental Pathology Laboratories, Inc. (EPL, Sterling, VA) performed the histopathological evaluations for both experiments. Sielken and Associates (Bryan, TX) conducted all statistical analyses. Water and stock samples were analyzed for E2 concentrations by WLI and for atrazine concentrations by Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc.

Larvae originated from 10 pairs of adult breeders for each experiment. At the supplier's facility, eggs were reared until day 3 postfertilization (dpf) and shipped to each laboratory. The experimental design and husbandry conditions are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. The larvae were acclimated in 50-l glass tanks and fed with Sera micron (Sera GmbH, Heinsberg, Germany). On dpf 8, tadpoles were randomly assigned to test tanks each containing finally 25 individuals. Tadpoles were fed three times daily with 300 mg Sera micron per tank and adjusted according to their development up to 900 mg per feeding. Exposures were initiated at dpf 8 and continued until metamorphosis was completed or until tadpoles had been exposed for dpf 83. Each experiment consisted of a total of seven groups, a positive control group [0.2 &#x003bc;g E2/l dissolved according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lutz <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> without solvent], a negative control group (dilution water), and five groups exposed to technical grade atrazine (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 25, and 100 &#x003bc;g atrazine/l). Each group consisted of eight tanks per group, except the negative control group, which included 16 tanks. The tanks in each treatment group were arranged in two clusters of four tanks, whereas negative control exhibited four clusters of four tanks. In experiment 1 (WLI), trace levels of atrazine were found in one cluster of four negative control tanks. A microbial bloom occurred in an additional cluster of negative control tanks and consequently data derived from both affected clusters were excluded from all statistical analyses. Despite the elimination of these two clusters, the built-in redundancy in the experimental design ensured that there were still eight negative control tanks and eight tanks per treatment group, and therefore the statistical analysis and interpretation were not adversely affected.</p><p>The clusters of tanks in the water baths (IGB) or environmental chamber (WLI) were randomly assigned to treatments. 25 larvae were randomly assigned to each test tank (<italic>n</italic> = 200 larvae per E2 or atrazine group and <italic>n</italic> = 400 larvae in the negative control group). Thus, a total of 1600 larvae were used in each laboratory.

After removal, frogs were euthanized by immersion in Finquel (MS-222, Argent Chemical Company, Redmond, WA) and given a unique identifier.

Tadpoles found dead prior to reaching Nieuwkoop and Faber stage 58 of metamorphosis were not examined for sexual differentiation.</p><p>The length of each frog (snout-to-vent) was measured to the nearest millimeter using a graduated grid.

The gonads of each frog were observed using a dissecting stereomicroscope, gonadal, and extragonadal anomalies were reported, and gonads from each individual were photographed <italic>in situ</italic> using a digital camera. Each photograph included a millimeter measurement scale placed adjacent to the gonads so that measurements of gonadal image area could be made from the image. The area of each gonad was calculated using Image-Pro Plus, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD.</p><p>After gross assessment of the gonads, each frog was fixed for 18&#x02013;36 h in Bouin's solution, rinsed with 70% ethanol and transferred to 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Following tissue processing, the trunk segment of each frog containing the gonads was embedded in paraffin. Step sections of 4- to 5-&#x003bc;m thickness were microtomed from each block at 12-&#x003bc;m intervals until gonads were completely sectioned. All sections that contained gonadal tissue were mounted on glass slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Prior to evaluation by the pathologist, slides were randomized and masked with coded numbers so that the pathologist was unaware (&#x0201c;blinded&#x0201d;) of the treatment group for each frog. The pathologist evaluated for potential abnormalities that included, but were not limited to, mixed sex, intersex, and testicular oocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Terminology.</title><p>Differences in descriptive terminology have contributed to the difficulties in interpreting the results of studies of gondal abnormalities in <italic>X. laevis</italic> and therefore, a consistent set of terms was developed to describe both gross and histological gonadal features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lutz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). For example, the term mixed sex was used to identify the co-occurrence of both ovarian and testicular tissue in a single gonad, whereas the term intersex was reserved to describe the contralateral occurrence of one testis and one ovary in one individual.</p></sec><sec><title>Sex determination and histopathology.</title><p>The phenotypic sex of each frog was identified as male, female, or mixed sex (intersex frogs were not observed in this study). Sex determinations were made based on both gross and histological basis, but only the histologically determined gender was used for as the basis for grouping frogs for analysis. A comparison between the gross and histopathological findings demonstrated that histopathology was far more accurate and sensitive for detecting gonadal abnormalities in <italic>X. laevis</italic>; therefore only the histopathological results are reported here.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>The tank was considered to be the primary experimental unit and statistical analyses used tank means (continuous endpoints) or tank percentages (incidence-based endpoints). To control the experiment-wise error rate for each endpoint at &#x003b1; = 0.05, statistical analysis of atrazine effects was performed in a stepwise fashion. First, a protective screening test comparing all groups except the positive control was performed. If this protective test detected significant heterogeneity among groups, comparisons of each atrazine group with the negative control were performed. For endpoints requiring two-sided control-treatment comparisons, the protective test used a 5% significance level threshold. When one-sided comparisons with control were appropriate, the protective test used a 10% significance threshold. Continuous variables (such as body weight) were analyzed using the one-way ANOVA as the preliminary test. When the ANOVA <italic>F</italic>-test was significant at the 5% significance level, each atrazine treatment was then compared with the negative control using pair-wise ANOVA contrasts at the 5% significance level. Incidence-based endpoints were analyzed using nonparametric statistical methods. The protective test for such endpoints was the Kruskal-Wallis test. If significant, this was followed by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney treatment-control comparisons at the 5% significance level.</p><p>Comparisons of the single E2-positive control with the negative control did not require protective tests. For female and combined-sex endpoints, the E2-control comparisons were analyzed using either a <italic>t</italic>-test (continuous) or a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (incidence) at the 5% level of significance. Analysis of incidence data among males in the E2-positive control group was an exception to these above procedures. Because feminization of the males in this group reduced the number of males per tank, analysis of incidence data for these frogs was performed using Fisher's Exact Test with individual frogs treated as the experimental unit.</p><p>All endpoints were also analyzed using a step-down procedure based on the Jonckheere-Terpstra nonparametric trend test. This procedure was used to determine if there was evidence of a monotonic dose related trend in responses for atrazine, and also to determine the concentration at which any existing trend test was no longer significant.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Environmental Conditions and Test Compound Concentrations</title><p>Environmental parameters remained within acceptable ranges throughout both experiments.

Therefore, <italic>X. laevis</italic> is a suitable model for testing the potential effects of atrazine. Consistent with this contention is our observation that E2 readily causes feminization of frogs under experimental conditions similar to those used in the current experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lutz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The clear feminization of <italic>X. laevis</italic> tadpoles exposed to 0.2 &#x003bc;g E2/l in a flow-through exposure system, demonstrated that these animals were very sensitive to moderate estrogenic influences.</p><p>Long-term exposure (75 days) of <italic>X. laevis</italic> to atrazine at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 &#x003bc;g/l had no effects upon the developmental endpoints (general condition, body weight, snout-to-vent length, time to completion of metamorphosis) or upon endpoints related to sexual differentiation (percentage of males and females, occurrence of mixed sex, intersex, or testicular oocytes). The absence of effects in atrazine exposed <italic>X. laevis</italic> indicates that atrazine neither feminizes nor demasculinizes frogs, as has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hayes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The results from the present study are also contrary to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hayes <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> who reported that 32&#x02013;40% of frogs exposed to atrazine at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 200 &#x003bc;g/l had multiple gonads. There is no obvious explanation for the differences between Hayes findings and the findings of the current study, however, the latter clearly indicates that atrazine does not cause gonadal feminization of <italic>X. laevis</italic>. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oka <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> demonstrated also clearly that atrazine had no estrogenic effects including a lack of potential to induce aromatase expression. Despite the clear absence of any estrogenic mode of action at two concentrations of atrazine, 10 and 100 &#x003bc;g/l, the authors noted a higher percentage of female phenotypes after larval exposure compared with negative controls having a higher percentage of male phenotypes and no mixed sex has been determined in any atrazine treatment. It has also been proposed that atrazine causes feminizing effects in males via upregulation of aromatase in testicular tissue, resulting in reduced testosterone and increased estrogen levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hayes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hayes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002, 2006</xref>).

In a similar study with a 46-day exposure to 10 or 100 &#x003bc;g atrazine/l, there were no significant differences between atrazine-treated frogs and negative controls in endpoints such as plasma testosterone, plasma E2, testicular aromatase activity or testicular ultrastructure at either dose level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hecker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Coady <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> failed to find any effect on the incidence of mixed sex, intersex, discontinuous gonads, plasma testosterone levels, or brain aromatase activity (brain, gonads) in <italic>X. laevis</italic> exposed to atrazine from 72-h posthatch through metamorphosis at concentrations of 0.01&#x02013;25 &#x003bc;g/l.</p><p>Field studies in South Africa with native African clawed frogs did not demonstrate significant differences in sex ratio, snout-to-vent length, body-mass, or age profiles between frogs exposed to atrazine in high-use areas versus nonuse control areas.

However, none of the effects associated with a moderate E2 exposure in the positive control frogs were seen in atrazine-treated frogs. In conclusion, the results of this large, multilaboratory, highly replicated study demonstrate that long-term exposure to atrazine at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 &#x003bc;g/l, over a period of time that included the critical window of sensitivity for sexual differentiation of <italic>X. laevis</italic>, has no effect on the growth, larval development, or sexual differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc</funding-source>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was conducted under the guidance and inspection of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
