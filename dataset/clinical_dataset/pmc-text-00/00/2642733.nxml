The assay relies on a novel monoclonal antibody (5F8) that binds to an epitope comprising amino acid residues 274&#x02013;281 (CNTKCQTP) in the HA1 region of H5 hemagglutinin. Database search analysis of publicly available sequences revealed that this epitope is conserved in 100&#x00025; of the 163 H5N1 viruses isolated from humans. The sensitivity and specificity of the epitope-blocking ELISA for H5N1 were evaluated using chicken antisera to multiple virus clades and other influenza subtypes as well as serum samples from individuals naturally infected with H5N1 or seasonal influenza viruses. The epitope-blocking ELISA results were compared to those of hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and microneutralization assays. Antibodies to H5N1 were readily detected in immunized animals or convalescent human sera by the epitope-blocking ELISA whereas specimens with antibodies to other influenza subtypes yielded negative results. The assay showed higher sensitivity and specificity as compared to HI and microneutralization.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The epitope-blocking ELISA based on a unique 5F8 mAb provided highly sensitive and 100&#x00025; specific detection of antibodies to H5N1 influenza viruses in human sera.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 was first detected among poultry in China in 1996.

Indonesia has reported a high case fatality rate; 112 deaths among 137 cases of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-WHO3">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-WHO4">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Based upon the available epidemiologic surveillance data, the world is now in phase 3 (of 6) of a pandemic alert, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-MounierJack1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-Sedyaningsih1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Serological investigations to detect specific antibodies from H5N1 infection or vaccination in humans and poultry are critical to the success of disease prevention and control programs. Several serologic tests are available, including hemagglutination inhibition (HI), microneutralization, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and agar gel precipitation. However, HI tests have limited value for detecting antibodies against H5N1 viruses in humans and other mammals because of their low sensitivity, subtype cross-reactivity, and inter-assay variability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-Julkunen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-Massicot1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The microneutralization assay is currently recommended for detection of antibodies to HPAI H5N1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-WHO5">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this test is labor-intensive and requires access to biocontainment facilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-Petric1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, rendering it impractical for rapid and high-throughput diagnostics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-StlzerBraid1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The H5N1 ELISA (indirect ELISA) has been widely used in serologic surveillance of chicken and turkey flocks. However, cross-reacting antibodies elicited by infection or vaccination with seasonal influenza virus can yield false positive H5N1 test results that reduce the value of indirect H5N1 ELISA in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-StlzerBraid1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We developed epitope-blocking ELISA (EB-ELISA) to detect serum antibodies to H5N1 viruses with high sensitivity and specificity. This assay yields a positive result when antibodies to the H5 hemagglutinin (HA) in test sera block binding of a labeled monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the H5 antigen. In practice, the intensity of the colored reaction product resulting from antigen-bound mAb is inversely proportional to the amount of epitope-specific antibody present in test serum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-Hall1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-Blitvich1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The biological significance of the test is determined by the epitope specificity of the mAb used in the EB-ELISA, and its broad applicability depends on the conservation of the epitope among H5N1 viruses. Further, the epitope recognized by the mAb should be highly antigenic so that antibodies to this epitope are consistently elicited in infected or vaccinated hosts. Here, we describe an EB-ELISA based on a mAb that meets these requirements. We evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this method using experimental chicken anti-sera and demonstrate its advantages with H5N1 convalescent human sera.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Viruses</title><p>Human (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;24) and avian (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2) influenza A viruses (subtype H5N1, clade 2.1) isolated in Indonesia were obtained from the Ministry of Health (MOH), Republic of Indonesia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004566-t001">Table 1</xref>).

To develop this assay, we relied on serum panels from normal and influenza-immunized chickens. First, a panel of 126 normal chicken serum samples lacking antibodies to influenza virus was used to determine the baseline of non-specific reduction in 5F8 binding to H5 antigen in the EB-ELISA. Mean reduction of EB-ELISA readings (i.e. blocking) was 8.5&#x00025; for this serum panel, with a standard deviation (SD) of 9.3. Specific blocking activities can be determined with 95&#x00025; confidence if a &#x0201c;cut-off value&#x0201d; of &#x02265;30&#x00025; is set for chicken serum samples. The latter was obtained by adding 2 SD to the mean 8.5&#x00025; blocking (8.5&#x0002b;18.6&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;27.1&#x00025;).</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of the mAb 5F8-based EB-ELISA was investigated using a panel of antisera from experimentally immunized chickens. Chicken sera collected 10 days after the 2<sup>nd</sup> immunization were first diluted to obtain HI titer of 16 to the homologous virus to normalize antibody concentrations prior to use in EB-ELISA. The EB-ELISA endpoint of the HI-normalized sera was then determined by further analysis of log2 serial dilutions. Sera from chickens immunized with H5N1 reassortant influenza viruses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004566-t002">Table 2</xref>) yielded mAb 5F8 blocking values above the 30&#x00025; cutoff in EB-ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004566-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Many samples showed &#x0003e;65&#x00025; inhibition at dilutions well below detection by HI titer (&#x0003c;4) indicating that the EB-ELISA detected low levels of antibody to H5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004566-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Moreover, sera from chickens immunized with H1&#x02013;H4, H6&#x02013;H10 and H12 showed maximum blocking of &#x0003c;10&#x00025;, well below the 30&#x00025; threshold established for samples containing specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004566-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). These results indicate that the EB-ELISA could positively identify serum samples containing antibodies to H5 and most importantly, sera containing antibodies to other HA subtypes tested negative for H5N1.

The conventional subtype-specific methods for serological surveillance are HI, microneutralization assay and ELISA, but these tests have significant limitations.

In particular, development of a blocking-ELISA for specific detection of antibodies to low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) subtype H5N2 viruses was reported recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-Chen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The 5F8 mAb selected for this study was found to recognize an epitope including the sequence CNTKCQTP in the HA1 region of the H5 HA. Analysis of this epitope in 4143 influenza A viruses HA sequences from the known subtypes (H1 through H16) revealed that this epitope is highly conserved in H5N1 viruses. The conservation rate of the epitope was absolute (100&#x00025;) among H5N1 viruses isolated from humans, indicating that this 5F8 mAb-based blocking-ELISA could be used for universal detection of H5N1 antibodies in human sera. The epitope is also highly conserved in H5N1 viruses isolated from avian sources (96.9&#x00025;). The 5F8 epitope was also found in 54&#x00025; of low pathogenic avian H5 viruses (H5N2-N9), therefore, the 5F8 mAb-based blocking-ELISA could not distinguish between HPAI H5N1 viruses and low pathogenic H5 subtypes in animals. However, low pathogenic H5 subtype viruses in poultry are also a serious concern due to their propensity to mutate and acquire high virulence. Therefore, detection of H5N1 antibodies using this EB-ELISA can also be especially useful in serological surveillance for H5 virus infection in poultry and wild birds. Of the 2812 non-H5 subtype viruses analyzed, only 14 H1 subtype viruses (2.3&#x00025;) were found to contain the 5F8 epitope (CNTKCQTP). Interestingly, these H1 subtype viruses were isolated between 1990 and 1999, suggesting that this epitope has become extinct in this subtype. We postulate that the H1N1-elicited 5F8 cross-reactive antibodies that could interfere in the H5 EB-ELISA can be considered relatively low.</p><p>The H5 HA genes of HPAI influenza viruses are classified into distinct phylogenic clades and subclades, many of which were targeted for development of H5N1 vaccine candidates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-The1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

In agreement with chicken antisera results, the 5F8 blocking-ELISA detected H5N1 antibodies in convalescent human sera and yielded no false-positive test with convalescent sera from seasonal influenza virus injections. Further studies are planned to determine whether the EB-ELISA will be useful to measure humoral antibody responses elicited by inactivated H5N1 pre-pandemic vaccines.</p><p>In summary, the EB-ELISA developed in this study has significant advantages relative to HI and microneutralization assay for the detection H5N1 antibodies. Consistent blocking of the 5F8 epitope by antibodies sera from chickens immunized with divergent H5 HA clades as well as convalescent human sera highlights the high antigenicity of this epitope. The conservation of this epitope (CNTKCQTP, aa 274&#x02013;281; equivalent to 277 to 284 in H3 numbering) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004566-Ha1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> in influenza H5 HA and its near complete absence in other subtypes indicates that mAb 5F8 meets the critical requirement for diagnosing H5 influenza virus infections using the epitope-blocking assay format. Taken together, these data suggest that this EB-ELISA is an attractive option for detection of antibodies to H5N1 viruses in human and animal sera with potential application for sero-diagnosis and surveillance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004566.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004566.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004566.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004566.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004566.s003"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004566.s003.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004566.s004"><label>Table S4</label><caption><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004566.s004.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful for the financial support received from Temasek Life Science Laboratory, Singapore.
