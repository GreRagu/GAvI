In <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, this amino acid is involved in energy metabolism, differentiation processes and resistance to osmotic stress. In this study, we analyzed the effects of interfering with L-proline metabolism on the viability and on other aspects of the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> life cycle using the proline analogue L- thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (T4C). The growth of epimastigotes was evaluated using different concentrations of T4C in standard culture conditions and at high temperature or acidic pH. We also evaluated possible interactions of this analogue with stress conditions such as those produced by nutrient starvation and oxidative stress. T4C showed a dose-response effect on epimastigote growth (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.89&#x000b1;0.02 mM at 28&#x000b0;C), and the inhibitory effect of this analogue was synergistic (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) with temperature (0.54&#x000b1;0.01 mM at 37&#x000b0;C). T4C significantly diminished parasite survival (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) in combination with nutrient starvation and oxidative stress conditions. Pre-incubation of the parasites with L-proline resulted in a protective effect against oxidative stress, but this was not seen in the presence of the drug. Finally, the trypomastigote bursting from infected mammalian cells was evaluated and found to be inhibited by up to 56&#x00025; when cells were treated with non-toxic concentrations of T4C (between 1 and 10 mM). All these data together suggest that T4C could be an interesting therapeutic drug if combined with others that affect, for example, oxidative stress. The data also support the participation of proline metabolism in the resistance to oxidative stress.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> is the causative agent of Chagas' disease, which affects approximately 12&#x02013;14 million people in endemic areas throughout Mexico, Central, and South America <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-WHO1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The illness is characterized by an acute phase with patent parasitemia and non-specific symptoms (if any), followed by a life-long chronic phase with subpatent parasitemia and scarce tissue parasitism. In the symptomatic phase, the heart is primarily affected, developing hypertrophy and dilatation, in addition to the digestive tract &#x02013; predominantly the esophagus and large intestine &#x02013; with the appearance of megaviscera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Tempone1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the invertebrate host (the triatomine insect belonging to the family Reduviidae, order Hemiptera), the parasite replicates as a non-infective form called epimastigote, which can differentiate into a metacyclic trypomastigote, an infectious but non-replicative form. This process is called metacyclogenesis. When these forms infect a vertebrate host, they invade host cells and differentiate into amastigotes, which then divide in the cell cytoplasm and differentiate again into trypomastigotes, passing through a transient epimastigote-like stage termed the intracellular epimastigote <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-AlmeidadeFaria1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Tyler1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Tonelli1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The main transmission route of the parasite is via insect vector bites on any region of the host skin. During its feeding, the insect vector deposits feces and urine containing metacyclic forms, which are usually self-inoculated by the host when scraping the wound caused by the insect bite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Alves1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The successful survival of the parasite in different environments throughout its life cycle (e.g. the vector intestinal tract, the mammalian host blood stream and the host cell cytoplasm) depends on its ability to maintain intracellular homeostasis of ions and nutrients and the ability to catabolize different substrates to obtain energy. Thus, the activity of transporters allowing the uptake of solutes across the parasite cytoplasmic membrane and the metabolism of certain amino acids are crucial processes at various points in the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> life cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Zilberstein1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Silber1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Landfear1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Among these nutrients, several amino acids play important roles in many biological processes. Some metabolic pathways are particularly important under stress situations such as the interconversion between arginine and phosphoarginine by the enzyme arginine kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Pereira1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This enzyme is regulated throughout the different growth phases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Pereira2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and is involved in resistance to pH and nutritional stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Pereira3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and in oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Miranda1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

In particular, L-proline is an important metabolite that is involved in the differentiation of intracellular epimastigote to trypomastigote forms, which is required for the establishment of infection in the mammalian host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Tonelli1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Previous work showed that L-proline was taken up from the extracellular environment through two active transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Silber2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and converted into five intermediates of the Krebs cycle (e.g., citrate, isocitrate, malate, succinate and oxaloacetate), pyruvate and the amino acids glutamate and aspartate, which are rapidly metabolized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004534-Sylvester1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, this parasite faces environmental temperature variations and the high temperature of the mammalian body (up to 37&#x000b0;C). Epimastigotes grow optimally at a temperature of 28&#x000b0;C, a condition in which a cell density of 94&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml was reached at the stationary phase. Our data showed, however, that cell growth reached a higher density at 33&#x000b0;C (120&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml), while cell growth at 37&#x000b0;C was even less than that obtained at 28&#x000b0;C (70&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml).

Both cultures were treated or not (controls) with T4C, then cell viabilities were determined using the MTT assay.

Between these two essential nutrients incorporated in PBS, the most significant effect was obtained with glucose because it served as a carbon and energetic source.

To better understand both the involvement of proline metabolism in resistance to oxidative and metabolic stresses and the interaction between these factors and T4C treatment, a three-variable experiment was performed: cell viability was evaluated as a function of oxidative and metabolic stress challenges and T4C treatment. Preliminary results forced us to diminish the metabolic stress by diminishing the starvation time from 72 (the time used above for metabolic stress experiments) to 48 h, since 72 h of starvation combined with oxidative stress and T4C treatment reduced viability to immeasurable levels. The parasites (20&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) were incubated for 48 h in PBS, supplemented or not with 3 mM proline.
