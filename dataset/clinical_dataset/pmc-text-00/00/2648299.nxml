INTRODUCTION</title><p>Acute infectious diarrhea is a worldwide public health problem with a long list of differentialdiagnoses. In the US, major pathogens responsible for most cases include <italic>Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, Escherichiacoli</italic> O157:H7, and <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>Vibrio, Yersinia, Listeria, Cyclospora, Clostridium difficile, Giardia</italic>, rotavirus, and <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> are also reported at lower rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Enterotoxigenic,enteropathogenic, enteroaggregative, and enteroinvasive strains of <italic>E. coli,</italic> toxin-producing <italic>Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcusaureus, Bacillus cereus,</italic> and norovirus also cause infectious diarrheas, butmay not be included in routine testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Main etiologies for acutediarrhea in the dog are the same or similar to organisms seen in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Other known pathogens of dogs include <italic>Clostridiumpiliforme</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], <italic>Brachyspira</italic> (<italic>Serpulina</italic>) spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and <italic>Helicobacter</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In both humans and dogs, anumber of bacteria, such as <italic>Enterococcus</italic>spp. and certain <italic>Clostridia</italic> spp., are recognized as opportunistic pathogens or enhance disease from otherorganisms when conditions are ideal for their growth and when competitors areabsent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Most cases of acute infectious diarrhea areself-limiting illnesses and resolve in a few days with or without symptomatictreatment with rehydration along with antimicrobial or antiparasitic drugstargeting the &#x0201c;etiological agent&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The presence of known GItract pathogens recovered or demonstrated is used to attribute an etiologyduring a diarrheic episode; however, causation is seldom proved.</p><p>Few animal modelsof functional GI disorders exist, but the dog GI tract and microbiota bear manysimilarities to those of humans. Dogs are monogastric omnivores in whichdietary manipulations are easy to achieve and a small-sized cecum provides onlya small component of hind gut fermentation. Dogs are litter bearers with ashort reproductive interval, where families of related individuals are easy toacquire and where management can be manipulated to control environmentalexposures. Early work has been done to describe GI microbiota in healthy dogs. Microbial community analysis of feces from 4 Labrador breed dogs was performed using culture followed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">17</xref>]. Despite intensive efforts, these methods underestimated community diversity andskewed results toward organisms more successful on particular culture media. Theseresults did support the use of molecular-based methodologies for determiningcommunity profiles, but at the time, sequences of many isolates were not foundin the Ribosomal Database Project and EMBL databases. Suchodolski et al. described the microbial community in duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and coloncontents from six healthy unrelated dogs using near-full-length 16S rRNA genePCR and cloned libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">18</xref>]. Here, <italic>Firmicutes</italic> was the most diverse and abundant phylum; <italic>Clostridiales</italic> was the most diversebacterial order, forming several <italic>Clostridium</italic> clusters; anaerobic <italic>Fusobacteriales</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidales</italic>increased in their relative abundance along the intestinal tract, peaking inileum and colon; and <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> occurred commonly in all parts of the intestine. These results on <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and <italic>Clostridiales</italic> were similar in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">19</xref>] with <italic>Clostridium</italic>cluster XIVa being the predominant contributor to <italic>Clostridiales</italic>sequences in both dogs and humans. Furthermore,<italic>Fusobacteria</italic> appeared to be a minor part ofthe intestinal community in other species, including humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">19</xref>]. Also, <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>&#x02014;including <italic>E. coli</italic>-like organisms&#x02014;predominated inthe duodenum and were sparse in the colon in both dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">18</xref>] and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">19</xref>]. In another study designed todefine host distribution patterns of fecal bacteria of the order <italic>Bacteroidales</italic> as markers for fecalsource identification in aquatic environments, human, dog, cat, and gull sequenceswere clustered together in phylogenetic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">20</xref>]. Swanson et al. performed astudy using healthy dogs to examine whether prebiotic (fructooligosaccharides)or probiotic (<italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic>)treatments would alter gut microbial populations, fermentative end products,and nutrient digestibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">21</xref>]. In one experiment,fructooligosaccharide treatment decreased <italic>C. perfringens</italic> and increased fecal butyrate and lactate concentrations, whilein a second experiment, this treatment increased bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, andfecal lactate and butyrate and decreased fecal ammonia, isobutyrate,isovalerate, and total branched-chain fatty acid concentrations. Finally, recentglobal vertebrate gut microbiota studies showed that captive (zoo) bush dogs oncarnivorous diets had microbial communities that clustered with othercarnivores, and that primates on omnivorous diets had fecal microbiota mostlike humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">23</xref>]. In these studies usingtree-based and network-based analyses of microbial communities, clustering bydiet (herbivore, omnivore, or carnivore) was highly significant. However, theseinvestigators did not consider the microbiota of modern pet dogs on highlyprocessed diets and cohabiting with humans. Taken together, these studies showthat dogs are a reasonable model for study of the role of microbiota in GIdisorders and that understanding of the GI microbial community in dogs is at astage of readiness for this to be pursued.</p><p>Many diarrhealdiseases are attributable to specific pathogens, to polymicrobial interactions,or to shifts or imbalances in the resident microbial community in response toexternal stress(s). Thus, acute diarrheas can result from myriad etiologiesmaking attribution difficult. Lately, attention has been focused on the role ofthe microbiota. The normal gut biota or &#x0201c;enterome&#x0201d; is a complex microbialecosystem that plays a crucial role in maintaining GI homeostasis and incertain disease states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">24</xref>]. However, 300&#x02013;500 differentbacterial species are estimated to inhabit the human colon, many of which arenot cultivatable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">25</xref>]. This estimate of diversityhas changed little over the years, even with the application of moleculartechniques to the study of the colonic microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">27</xref>]. Eckburg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">26</xref>] used collector's curves to estimate that extensive sequencing would reveal at least 500 species. Adding to complexity duringanalysis are the sheer numbers of GI organisms, which can reach a density of 10<sup>12</sup> organisms/gram of feces, with a total gut population of 10<sup>14</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>15</sup> microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">28</xref>]. In the dog, breed and agewere shown to have significant effects on particular aerobic and anaerobicbacterial counts using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR amplified16S ribosomal fragments. Here, each individual dog harbored a characteristicfecal bacterial community which was independent of diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">29</xref>]. We hypothesized that dogshave a stable composition of the colon microbial community and that episodes ofdiarrhea lead to long lasting changes in community composition and/or function;furthermore, treatment for specific pathogens cancompound these effects. To address this hypothesis, we required (1)diarrheic perturbations of the GI tract with or without treatment to study, (2)documentation of the presence of pathogens in the GI tract, (3) acost-effective technique for assessing shifts in the GI tract microbiota, and(4) the assurance that the microbiota in an individual is stable enough for usto be able to detect meaningful changes. We used diagnostic PCR assays todocument the presence of pathogens in the GI tract. The GI tract perturbationswe studied were (1) acute episodes of diarrhea with or without antibiotictreatment and (2) changes in diet and medications. The technique we chose forassessing shifts in the GI tract microbiota was terminal restriction fragmentlength polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis.</p><p>T-RFLP is one of a family of relatedtechniques used to describe microbial communities containing large numbers oforganisms that are undescribed and/or difficult to cultivate. T-RFLP is basedon PCR amplification and restriction enzyme digestion of 16S rDNA PCR productsfollowed by capillary electrophoresis on a DNA sequencer. Here, data wereanalyzed using exploratory statistical techniques that help reveal patternsrather than the more familiar inferential statistics that help discriminatebetween hypotheses. Community studies using these techniques that have beenreported to date have involved small numbers of samples. For example, Nielsen et al. characterizedpopulations of lactic acid bacteria and total bacterial communities in onesample each from three colon segments in four human subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">30</xref>]. In this study, the totalcommunities from different parts of the colon in the same individual weresimilar to each other, but total communities varied between individuals. Inanother trial, fecal communities were studied in eight individuals of differentages and sexes; five adults and two children had similar arrays ofmicroorganisms in their fecal communities but different proportions of the bacterialspecies, while a two-week-old infant had a much simpler community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">31</xref>]. Thus, T-RFLP data revealedvaluable results even though attribution of gains or losses of specificbacterial genera or species was not possible. Also, we recognize that manyfactors may affect the results obtained with the T-RFLP technique; thesefactors include choice of primers; choice of restriction enzymes; and variousamplification biases due to PCR reaction parameters such as amount andcomplexity of the template DNA, annealing temperature, and number of cycles inthe amplification reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">35</xref>]. Nevertheless, T-RFLP israpid, sensitive, and reproducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">34</xref>], and, unlike many othercommunity analysis techniques, it yields both taxonomic information regardingorganisms in the community and estimates of their relative proportions in thetotal microbial population. It is considered a useful tool in the study ofmicrobial communities and can be used to generate data that help to determinewhether further studies employing more precise, laborious, and expensivetechniques, such as targeted real-time PCR for the detection and quantizationof specific microorganisms or the generation, sequencing, and analysis ofcloned 16S rDNA libraries, are justified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">31</xref>].</p><p>To address ourhypothesis, we studied the microbialcommunities of dogs during diarrheic episodes and compared them to those ofhealthy control dogs to make a preliminary assessment of the contribution ofmembers of the normal community to acute diarrheal disease processes. Results of these studies showed that fecal microbiotas variedamong dogs, even those that were closely related, and were largelyinfluenced by diet. A dog treated for diarrhea with metronidazole did exhibitloss of richness followed by return to a stable microbiota; the same treatmentaimed at a second bout of diarrhea resulted in an unstable microbiota thatultimately lost richness and evenness. Thus, our hypothesis, that dogs haverelatively stable colon microbial communities and episodes of diarrhea lead toinstability which is compounded by antimicrobial treatmentsfor specific pathogens, can be addressed using these methods particularlyif environmental exposures are limited. This work demonstrates that dogs can beused to study changes in microbial communities associated with naturally occurringdiarrheas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

Enrollment of study dogs and experimental design</title><p>We established a standard operating procedure forsample collection and processing that was approved by the Michigan StateUniversity Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (2-16-2006). The studyalso followed all guidelines and standard protocols of the Michigan StateUniversity (MSU) Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH). Information on all animalsincluded in the study is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. A panel of eight household pet dogs was enrolled in the study over oneyear. These eight dogs included two pets from a single household (Pets 1 and 2in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>; Pet 1 suffered one episode of diarrhea), a single pet from a secondhousehold (Pet 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>; this pet suffered two episodes of diarrhea whichwere treated at the MSU VTH), a single healthy pet from a third household(Pet 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>), two healthy pets from a fourth household (Pets 5 and 6 in<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>), and two pets from different households presenting to the MSU VTH withdiarrhea (Pets 7 and 8 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Fivecontrol dogs from an extended genetically related family were enrolled thatwere housed in an MSU-closed research colony, were fed the same food daily, andwere exercised indoors to prevent infections. Feces were collected from thesedogs to assess repeatability and technical quality of our protocols and toprovide comparisons to diarrhea cases.</p><p>All diagnostic tests (except for an ELISA testfor <italic>Giardia</italic>) and T-RFLP analyses were conducted on DNA isolated fromfecal samples. DNA of sufficient quality for T-RFLP analysis could not beisolated from one of two samples from Pet 4 or from Pets 5, 6, 7, or 8. Diagnostic PCR results are presented for all thirteen dogs: T-RFLP results arepresented for the five research colony dogs and four household pet dogs (Pets1, 2, 3, and 4). For T-RFLP analysis of fecal microbiota over time, wecollected repeated fecal samples from three household pet dogs to assessvariability of the microbiota based on housing and feeding regimes. Asmentioned above, two of these three dogs experienced diarrhea, one of themtwice. Therefore, we collected samples from these dogs during and after treatment,if any, with the prescribed antibiotic.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2.

Sample handling and DNA isolation</title><p>Preliminary studies were conducted to define the bestmethod of handling fecal samples to optimize T-RFLP analysis. Using cleangloves for each animal, samples from research colony dogs and Pets 1 and 2 weretaken as free catch or rectal samples; samples from other dogs were taken fromthe ground immediately after defecation taking care to avoid taking any part ofthe sample that touched the ground. Subsamples were taken from the interior ofthe fecal mass for analysis. The feces was placed into tryptose soy broth with15% glycerol, mixed well, aliquoted into at least 4-5 identicalsubsamples; three were frozen back at &#x02212;80 and one had DNA extracted that day. Samples were subjected to one of the following treatments: holding on ice onlylong enough for transport to the laboratory, holding at room temperature for 24hours prior to DNA extraction, holding on ice for 24 hours prior to DNAextraction, refrigeration for 24 hours prior to DNA extraction, and freezingfor 24 hours prior to DNA extraction. These conditions were intended to mimicthe possible fates of clinical specimens prior to submission to thelaboratory. DNA could be recovered inquantities sufficient for diagnostic PCR and T-RFLP analysis from samplessubjected to all treatments, although yields were greater when samples wereheld on ice only long enough for transport to the laboratory. Freezing waspreferred when samples could not be processed immediately in order to avoidchanges in microbiota that have been documented in samples held at room orrefrigeration temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">38</xref>].</p><p>Bacterialpopulations were recovered from 200 mg of feces by suspending samples in 300 mMsucrose solution followed by two low-speed centrifugations as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

Episodes of diarrhea occurred beginning on days 61 and 168; bothepisodes were treated with metronidazole (1st treatment starting on day65 (14.0 mg/kg BID, for 10 days) and 2nd treatment starting on day 172 (14.0 mg/kg BID for 6 days)), and a brief period on a low-residue diet. Because thesecond episode of diarrhea occurred 107 days after the first and the microbiotareturned to its starting composition during the interval, the second episodewas probably not an antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

On the last day of sampling, representatives of all the orderspreviously present were detected, but their proportions were altered from thosein the normal samples. The dendrogram showing the similarities of thecommunities at different times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, Panel (b)) also demonstrates thispattern: most of the samples taken prior to day 168 cluster together and awayfrom the diarrheic samples and the normal samples taken after the secondepisode of diarrhea.</p><p>Changes incommunity richness parameter <italic>Rr</italic> valuesare shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, Panel (c).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Marzorati et al. characterized %change values around 0.10 as indicating that the community is stable; new organismsare able to become established but do not interfere with community function. Very high % change values were associated with the diarrheic episodes in Pet 3,and after the second episode, the % change values continued to fluctuate,indicating that the community did not return to stability. This period of instability coincided with theperiod of repeated changes in medications and diet.</p><p>Temporalvariability in the T-RFLP data was also analyzed using the regression method ofCollins et al.

DISCUSSION</title><p>Screening for specific pathogens by PCR revealed that most animals carried one or morepotential enteric pathogens in their fecal microbiota even when they had noclinical signs. Thus, many cases of &#x0201c;spontaneous&#x0201d; diarrhea in dogs&#x02014;and by extension,sporadic diarrhea in humans&#x02014;may be caused byorganisms already present in the GI tract following perturbation of themicrobiota by an environmental factor rather than by a pathogen acquired fromanother source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. The hypothesis thatalterations in the microbiota may inhibit or facilitate disease processes hasbeen invoked in the context of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases; our resultssupport the idea that there may be a significant role for the microbiota inacute infectious disease processes. Other clinical and experimental studiessuggest that the relative balance of aggressive and protective bacterialspecies is altered in inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease (CD),ulcerative colitis (UC), and pouchitis. In a reviewof current work in this area, it was postulated that overly aggressiveimmune responses to a subset of commensal (nonpathogenic) enteric bacteria ingenetically predisposed individuals result in disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Recently, Frank et al. showed that CD patients, UC patients, and noninflamed controls hadstatistically significantly different microbiotas based on culture-independentrRNA sequence analysis of cloned libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Because it was based onsurgical samples of colon, this study provided a survey of gut-wall associatedmicrobiota relevant to Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Here, as in all studiesusing methods based on SSU rRNA, bacterial &#x0201c;numbers&#x0201d; were recognized to berelative estimates reflecting gene copy numbers and not indicative ofcausation. However, microbiota surveys can provide candidates for hypothesistesting of causation. In our study, fecal samples could be argued to bestrepresent &#x0201c;diagnostic&#x0201d; samples that would be taken from a host presenting withacute diarrhea. It is acknowledged that further work will be needed to documentthe ability of readily available fecal samples to represent different locationswithin the colon to document the etiologies of these diarrheas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>].</p><p>The influence of diet and medication on the intestinal microbiota has been studied directlyin animals and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Although it was not ourintent to study such effects, our results confirm that the composition of theintestinal microbiota is quite sensitive to changes in environmental factorssuch as changes in diet and/or medications as well as exposure to themicrobiotas of other animals. The relatively consistent microbiotas of theresearch colony dogs are in marked contrast to the fluctuations observed in Pet1, which roamed freely in a rural environment. The microbiotas of Pets 2 and 3,which were more closely supervised when out of doors, showed less variabilitythan that observed in Pet 1 but more than in the research colony dogs. Finally, fluctuations in the microbiota ofPet 3 became much more pronounced when diet and medication were changed.</p><p>Comparison of results from T-RFLP and Q-PCR results for Pet3 showed that both methods can detect variation in the microbiota associatedwith events such as diarrheal episodes and changes in diet and medication. Theextensive variability in the abundances of the different groups of organismsevident in the T-RFLP data was also evident in the Q-PCR results for individualgroups and organisms; population variability (PV) values for all organismsassayed by Q-PCR were high. This result is not surprising given the wide rangeof target DNA concentrations detected by this assay (lowest detected level, 3.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> ng for <italic>E. faecalis</italic>;highest detected level, 1.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>2</sup> ng for <italic>Bacteroides</italic>).</p><p>The T-RFLP analysis indicated that there was a largeincrease in <italic>Clostridiales,</italic> including the <italic>Bsl</italic>I 749 bp peak definedby Nagashima et al.

This result suggests that the instability of themicrobial community during this period facilitated the growth of this potentialpathogen.</p><p>T-RFLP analysis also indicated large increases in <italic>Bacillales;</italic> which includes lactobacilli, streptococci, and enterococci; subsequent to metronidazole treatment. In Q-PCR analysis, both <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> exhibited repeated substantial increases after theinitiation of metronidazole treatment, and after the second episode ofdiarrhea, <italic>E. faecium</italic> levels did not return to those seen at thebeginning of the study. These results suggest that, in view of the potential ofboth <italic>E. faecium</italic> and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> to have deleterious effects onthe GI tract, the use of metronidazole as a first-line treatment for caninediarrhea should be re-evaluated.</p><p>Perturbations in <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. levels associated with the two episodes of diarrhea were also apparent;levels of these organisms decreased during both episodes of diarrhea and becameunstable during the period when diet and medication were varied. Since <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. are major components ofthe colon microbial community and essential to its function, such fluctuationsmight be expected to have repercussions for colon health.</p><p>The discrepancybetween the two methods in detecting the genus <italic>Bacteroides</italic> in thisanimal would be most simply explained as a relative inability of the universaleubacterial 16S primers used to bind to the 16S rDNA sequences of theparticular <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. predominating in that dog compared to themore specific primers used in the Q-PCR assay. However, members of the <italic>Bacteroidales</italic> were detected by the primers used in T-RFLP analysis in four of the fiveresearch colony dogs and in Pets 1 and 2. BLAST searchesindicated that the region of homology between the Nagashima et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">31</xref>] reverse primer to the 16SrDNA sequence of (1) some but not all strains of <italic>Bacteroides eggerthii</italic>,(2) some but not all strains of <italic>B. stercoris</italic>, and (3) some but not allstrains of <italic>B. caccae</italic> consists only of the seven bases from nucleotide 11to nucleotide 17 of the 19-base primer. This limited homology was even presentin the 16S rDNA sequences of the type strains of <italic>B. stercoris</italic> and <italic>B. caccae</italic>. No PCR product would be obtained from DNA of these strains. Also, BLASTsearches indicated that the 16S primers used for the Q-PCR studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] would be expected to amplifyrDNA of all strains of these three species. However, <italic>B. eggerthii, B. stercoris</italic>, and <italic>B. caccae</italic> arefound in humans; in a cloned library study, sequences closely related to <italic>B. stercoris</italic> were obtained from dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">20</xref>]. Of the <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. sequences obtained from dogs in the latter study, one was very similar tothat of <italic>B. stercoris</italic>, three were similar to that of <italic>B. vulgatus,</italic> andfour were not similar to those of any of the published <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. used in the analysis. The same study also indicated that the <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. sequences from the fecal microbial communities of humans, dogs, cats, andgulls clustered together and separately from those of cattle and elk.</p><p>We applied thecommunity characterization schema proposed by Marzorati et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] to the dog fecal bacterialcommunities studied here and related them to what we know about the managementand clinical presentation of the dogs. The research colony dog communities werecharacterized by high richness and intermediate &#x0201c;balanced&#x0201d; levels of functional organization. Because of the constancy of the environment of these dogs, we predict thattheir communities would experience low-to-medium dynamics similar to thoseobserved in normal samples from Pet 3. The communities of Pets 1, 2, and 4 weregenerally characterized by lower richness, balanced functional organization,and high levels of dynamic change for Pets 1 and 2.</p><p>The normalcommunities of Pet 3 prior to and following the first episode of diarrhea werecharacterized by high richness, medium levels of dynamic change, and balancedfunctional organization, while the diarrheic samples were characterized by lowrichness, high levels of dynamic change, and low levels of functionalorganization. Communities in the normal samples taken following the secondepisode of diarrhea were characterized by continued low richness, fluctuatinglevels of dynamic change, and somewhat lower levels of functional organizationthan previous normal samples. The fluctuating levels of dynamic change weretemporally correlated with changes in diet and medication. Time lag analysisindicated that samples taken when diet and medication were constant&#x02014;the initialsamples, samples taken during the first episode of diarrhea, and samples takenprior to the second episode of diarrhea&#x02014;showed arecognizable pattern of disturbance followed by a return to the initialcondition. Samples taken when diet and medications were varied&#x02014;beginning withthe onset of the second episode diarrhea and continuing to the end of the study&#x02014;did not exhibitany directional changes but instead showed random fluctuation. The generalagreement between these complementary analyses suggests that concepts frommacroecology will be useful in interpreting data from microbial communities.</p><p>According toMarzorati et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], the level of the communityrichness parameter <italic>Rr</italic> is indicative of the carrying capacity of theenvironment; diet is one obvious environmental variable that might affect thecarrying capacity in the GI tract. The similar values of <italic>Rr</italic> obtained forresearch colony dogs fed and housed under controlled conditions supports thisidea. However, Pet 2 was genetically related to the research colony dogs andwas fed a similar diet, but exhibited lower community richness. This free-roaming dog probably had a muchmore variable intake than the research colony dogs, so values for apparentcarrying capacity might have been influenced by the highly dynamic nature ofthe microbial community in this animal. A similar effect can be seen in the richness parameter values for Pet 3; <italic>Rr</italic> varied widely subsequent to perturbation and periods of dynamicchange in the community due to episodes of diarrhea.</p><p>The level of dynamic change also varied considerably in Pets 1, 2, and 4, and wascorrelated with environmental factors in that Pets 1 and 2 experienced bothmore environmental variation and consistently higher levels of change incommunity composition than did Pet 3 during healthy periods. The community functional organizationparameter <italic>Fo</italic> is held by Marzorati et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] to reflect the resistance of the communitystructure to perturbation. If <italic>Fo</italic> values do predict community resiliency, then such resiliency may explain whyboth Pet 1 and Pet 2, which had relatively robust <italic>Fo</italic> values, were mainlynon-diarrheic in spite of having high levels of dynamic change andsubstantially shifting community compositions. In the case of Pet 1, the latterphenomena may have been due to varied intake of substances from theenvironment; in the case of Pet 2, a puppy, these phenomena may have been dueto maturation processes in the GI tract. In addition, after the second episode of diarrhea in Pet 3, <italic>Fo</italic> values declined and the community appeared to become less stable under theinfluence of changing diet and medication regimes; this observation furthersupports the connection between functional organization and resiliency.</p><p>Studies with larger sample sizes are required to substantiate these apparentcorrelations in a rigorous way. Also, morework is clearly needed to delineate the variability of the microbiota of thehealthy GI tract before embarking on detailed studies of disease states. However, based on these observations, we would predict that if the normal orbackground variability is substantial, it may prove exceedingly difficult todetect relevant changes in heterogeneous populations such as individualsenrolled in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec5"><title>5. CONCLUSIONS</title><p>We hypothesizedthat dogs have a stable composition of the colon microbial community and thatepisodes of diarrhea lead to long lasting changes in community compositionand/or function; furthermore, treatment for specificpathogens can compound these effects. Outbredmonogastric animals like dogs can serve as easily manipulable models to addressapproaches for problems of the human GI tract. Thus, the microbiota of dogs wasstudied during diarrheic episodes and compared to those of healthy control dogsto make a preliminary assessment of the contribution of members of themicrobiota to acute diarrheal disease processes. We found that (1) four of fivedogs living in an environment expected to provide the least exposure to factorsthat might alter the GI tract microbiota had similar microbiotas, (2) themicrobiotas of dogs kept in more variable environments were correspondinglymore variable, (3) acute episodes of diarrhea resulted in large-scale changesin the GI tract microbiota, and (4) when the diet and medications of a doghaving a previously stable microbiota were changed repeatedly, the GI tractmicrobiota also changed repeatedly, ultimately reducing richness. The highlevels of variability we encountered in the pet dogs indicate that descriptivepopulation-based microbiota studies may be so fraught with variation within andbetween individuals that meaningful patterns and changes may be hard todistinguish from the &#x0201c;noise.&#x0201d; Eitherlongitudinal studies of individuals under relatively constant environmental regimes(Pet 3) or model-based studies of groups of individuals under strictlycontrolled environments (research colony dogs) with planned experimentalinterventions could be expected to yield interpretable results. Theconsistency of the microbial communities in the research colony dogs and thechanges we were able to observe in Pet 3 indicate that it is possible toestablish baseline starting conditions and that the methods employed in thesestudies can be used todetect and delineate changes in fecal microbial communities. We expectthese considerations derived from this useful animal model to apply with equalforce to studies in humans.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank the Companion Animal Fund of the MSU College ofVeterinary Medicine for funding this project.
