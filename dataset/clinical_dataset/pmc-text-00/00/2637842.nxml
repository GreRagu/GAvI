The proline-rich N-terminal domain derived from the maize storage protein &#x003b3; zein (Zera) is sufficient to induce PBs in non-seed tissues of Arabidopsis and tobacco. This Zera property opens up new routes for high-level accumulation of recombinant proteins by fusion of Zera with proteins of interest. In this work we extend the advantageous properties of plant seed PBs to recombinant protein production in useful non-plant eukaryotic hosts including cultured fungal, mammalian and insect cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Various Zera fusions with fluorescent and therapeutic proteins accumulate in induced PB-like organelles in all eukaryotic systems tested: tobacco leaves, <italic>Trichoderma reesei</italic>, several mammalian cultured cells and Sf9 insect cells. This accumulation in membranous organelles insulates both recombinant protein and host from undesirable activities of either. Recombinant protein encapsulation in these PBs facilitates stable accumulation of proteins in a protected sub-cellular compartment which results in an enhancement of protein production without affecting the viability and development of stably transformed hosts. The induced PBs also retain the high-density properties of native seed PBs which facilitate the recovery and purification of the recombinant proteins they contain.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Zera sequence provides an efficient and universal means to produce recombinant proteins by accumulation in ER-derived organelles. The remarkable cross-kingdom conservation of PB formation and their biophysical properties should have broad application in the manufacture of non-secreted recombinant proteins and suggests the existence of universal ER pathways for protein insulation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Efficient expression, accumulation and recovery of recombinant eukaryotic proteins in their native conformations are difficult to achieve at reasonable cost in cell-based biomanufacturing systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In general, such platforms are either highly capital-intensive mammalian cell cultures based on secreted proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], or require complex and inefficient refolding of bacterially expressed proteins sequestered in insoluble inclusion bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Among eukaryotes, the plant kingdom has evolved cereal seeds to facilitate massive and extremely stable intracellular accumulation of complex proteins in a dense form that enables rapid protein mobilization during germination. A key biological sequestration mechanism of plant seed storage proteins involves the formation of protein bodies (PBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In maize, one type of PB formed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen of endosperm cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] contains zeins, a group of polypeptides which account for more than half of the total seed protein mass. The 27 kD &#x003b3; zein protein bears an N-terminal signal sequence but is retained intracellularly rather than being secreted even though it lacks a canonical KDEL/HDEL ER-retention signal. Instead, &#x003b3; zein localizes to the periphery of the PBs surrounding aggregates of other zein proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although the mechanism of PB biogenesis is not fully understood, it appears that the initial presence of &#x003b3; zein confers stability to other PB-associated zeins and facilitates their sequential assembly in the PB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Surprisingly, heterologous expression of &#x003b3; zein in plant leaves results in the ectopic formation of membrane-bound structures strongly resembling cereal PBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], suggesting that one or more structural motifs of &#x003b3; zein may be responsible for <italic>de novo </italic>PB formation. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that a synthetic peptide of the N-terminal repeat region of &#x003b3; zein (eight repeating units of the peptide PPPVHL) was able to self-assemble <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and that both &#x003b3; zein proline-rich domains, the repeat region and the so-called Pro-X sequence, each contribute to PB biogenesis when expressed recombinantly in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Here, we describe a protein fusion-based approach for heterologous protein production via creation of induced PB-like organelles. Exploiting the natural mechanism of protein accumulation in seed PBs, we demonstrate that not only is the Zera domain capable of directing assembly of PB-like organelles in plant tissues other than seeds, but this assembly property also extends to a broad range of non-plant eukaryotes including fungal, insect and mammalian cells. These synthetic PBs share many of the advantageous storage properties of bona fide cereal PBs, including the presence of eukaryotic chaperones to facilitate recombinant protein folding, high densities that allow simple downstream target protein concentration by PB capture, and insulation of PB contents from proteolytic and enzymatic activities of the cytosol. Transferring the seed-type attributes conferred by PB sequestration to proven eukaryotic cell-based and transgenic expression systems creates unique opportunities for improving biological manufacturing. Such an approach is of particular interest for polypeptides which are poorly secreted, host-toxic, or otherwise challenging to produce.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The &#x003b3; zein proline-rich domain (Zera) induces protein body-like organelles in eukaryotic cells</title><p>To explore if PB attributes could be transferred to divergent eukaryotic lineages and a broad range of fusion protein partners, we first investigated the induction of PBs in various hosts expressing fusions of the engineered Zera domain to fluorescent reporter proteins. Epidermal cells of tobacco leaves transiently expressing a Zera-ECFP (enhanced cyan fluorescent protein) construct displayed well-defined and highly fluorescent foci distributed throughout the cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) that were similar in size and appearance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, see inset) to the natural, round, 1 to 2 micron PBs present in maize seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To define more specifically the role of Zera in PB formation we compared these results with the fluorescence of ECFP preceded by the &#x003b3; zein N-terminal signal peptide either with (SPg-ECFP-KDEL, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) or without (SPg-ECFP, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) the KDEL C-terminal ER retention signal. The proteins from construct SPg-ECFP-KDEL accumulated in the ER (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) while those from SPg-ECFP were secreted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), but neither were capable of inducing PB-like organelles.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Proline-rich domain of &#x003b3; zein (Zera) induces PB-like organelles in plants, CHO cells, insect cells and fungi</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Confocal image of PB-like organelles formed in epidermal leaf cells of tobacco transformed with Zera-ECFP (see a higher magnification image in the inset). <bold>(B) </bold>ER network image of ECFP retained in the ER of tobacco cells expressing SPg-ECFP-KDEL. <bold>(C) </bold>ECFP secretion pattern in tobacco cells transformed with SPg-ECFP construct.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected stably and transiently with Zera-ECFP constructs or appropriate non-Zera controls. Dense, highly fluorescent foci became visible in the cytoplasm starting two to three days following transfection with Zera-ECFP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The contribution of the Zera domain to storage organelle formation was also investigated using ECFP fused directly to SPg, either with or without a C-terminal KDEL retention signal. Confocal images obtained from cells expressing SPg-ECFP-KDEL showed a typical ER pattern (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), while fluorescence was distributed throughout the ER and the Golgi complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>, arrow heads) as expected for secretory transport in cells expressing SPg-ECFP without KDEL. We also analyzed by immunoblotting the effect of Zera on partitioning of ECFP between cells and the extracellular medium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). Zera-ECFP and ECFP-KDEL remained exclusively intracellular (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>, lanes 1 and 3), while ECFP without Zera or KDEL was secreted efficiently (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>, lanes 2). Taken together these results show evidence for the entry of Zera-ECFP into the initial portion of the secretory pathway but exclusion from ultimate secretion. This observation prompted us to investigate whether Zera-ECFP was sorted terminally in the ER, or was able to exit this compartment in order to subsequently reach the Golgi complex. Zera fusions were co-transfected with an ER membrane protein marker, calnexin, and with a Golgi protein reporter, a glycosyltransferase fused to YFP. Calnexin was found to co-localize with Zera-ECFP PBs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>) but no co-localization was observed in CHO cells between Zera-ECFP and the Golgi reporter protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1M</xref>), consistent with an ER origin of the Zera-induced PBs.</p><p>Filamentous fungi and insect cells were also found to support the biogenesis of seed-type PBs induced by expression of Zera fusions. Significant accumulation of Zera-GFP fusion protein in dense structures was observed in hyphae of <italic>Trichoderma reesei </italic>transformed with Zera-GFP constructs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1N</xref>, arrow). The Zera fusion protein accumulated intracellularly to ca. 0.1% of fresh weight when expression was driven by the Trichoderma <italic>CbhI </italic>promoter. In Spodoptera (Sf9) cells infected with recombinant Zera-DsRED baculovirus, the fusion protein also accumulated in abundant, intensely-fluorescent PB-like structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1P</xref>, arrow). In contrast, DsRed controls expressed without Zera showed fluorescence dispersed diffusely throughout the cells with no formation of dense structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1O</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Zera stabilizes biopharmaceutical proteins by intracellular encapsulation in PB-like organelles</title><p>The ability of the Zera domain to segregate proteins away from normal secretory transport into PB organelles appears to be conserved between plants, fungi, insects and animals. In light of these results, we then asked whether Zera fusions could provide an efficient and universal means to produce diverse recombinant proteins by stable encapsulation in ER-derived organelles. To test this hypothesis, we fused Zera to calcitonin (Ct), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and human growth hormone (hGH) sequences and expressed these fusion constructs in various eukaryotic hosts. Expression and PB induction by Zera-Ct, Zera-EGF and Zera-hGH was first investigated using three different types of mammalian cells following transient or stable transfection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Human HEK293T cells were transfected with Zera-Ct and Zera-hGH, CHO cells with Zera-hGH and Zera-EGF and Cos1 cells with Zera-EGF. In all cases, Zera fusion proteins were present intracellularly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lanes 1) but were not secreted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lanes 2). Moreover, immunodetection of calcitonin in transiently transfected human (HEK293T), primate (Cos1) and hamster (CHO) cells expressing Zera-Ct revealed that the recombinant protein was encapsulated inside PB-like vesicles in all cultured cell types tested (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Several biopharmaceutical proteins fused to Zera remain encapsulated in PB-like organelles in transfected mammalian cells</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Western blots of Zera-Ct, Zera-hGH and Zera-EGF demonstrating accumulation inside transfected mammalian cells (lanes 1) without significant secretion into the cell culture media (lanes 2). <bold>(B-D) </bold>Immunodetection of Zera-Ct in 293T <bold>(B)</bold>, Cos1 <bold>(C) </bold>and CHO <bold>(D) </bold>transfected cells using an anti-calcitonin antibody and FITC-labeled secondary antibody.

The recombinant protein had the expected molecular weight and was localized to prominent electron-dense spherical structures that were 1 to 2 microns in size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). The membrane bounding the PB-like structures in Zera-hGH CHO cells was studded with ribosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref> inset), suggestive of a rough-ER origin, and the structures were highly enriched in Zera-hGH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). Immunogold-labeled Zera-hGH appeared in the newly formed PBs, whereas no significant labeling was observed in any other cell compartment. Cryosections of non-transfected cells did not contain PB-like structures (data not shown). Interestingly, despite the presence of heterologous PB organelles containing high concentrations of recombinant proteins, transfected mammalian cells were indistinguishable from non-transfected CHO cells with respect to proliferation ability and propensity to undergo apoptosis or necrosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>, respectively). This indicates that the accumulation of Zera fusion proteins within PBs does not in itself perturb normal cell growth and viability.</p><p>To explore the ability of induced PBs to accumulate biopharmaceutical recombinant proteins in plants we generated transgenic tobacco expressing Zera-EGF and Zera-Ct fusions. Protein extracts from leaves of homozygous Zera-EGF and Zera-Ct tobacco plants were analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody (&#x003b1;R8) raised against Zera. Major bands corresponding to the expected apparent molecular masses of the respective fusion proteins were observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 1 and 2), with fainter high MW bands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, arrows) likely reflecting oligomerized Zera fusions.

In order to evaluate the stability of Zera-EGF and Zera-Ct fusions in PBs, we compared protein accumulation in flash-frozen leaf material vs. leaves dried at 37&#x000b0;C for one week after harvest and subsequently stored at room temperature for five months (such storage typically results in substantial proteolysis). At the end of the five-month storage period expression levels of each fusion protein were determined by immunoblotting. No significant difference was found between frozen and dried leaves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), despite the significant desiccation stress.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Zera stabilizes biopharmaceutical proteins in transformed plants</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Immunodetection with anti-Zera antibody (anti-R8) of Zera-EGF (lane 1) and Zera-Ct (lane 2) in leaves of stably-transformed tobacco plants.

No significant immunolabeling was observed in the cell wall, nucleus, chloroplasts or other organelles. The major ER chaperone BiP was also detectable by immunogold within the PB-like structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>) suggesting that the process of PB formation may involve incorporation of pre-existing ER-resident proteins into these structures. BiP is known to be present in cereal PBs where it is thought to play a role in storage, protein folding and assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Hence, co-localization of Zera-Ct and BiP in the PB-like organelles formed in tobacco leaves indicates that the recombinant fusion proteins are associated closely with chaperones that may mediate eukaryotic protein folding in the ER. The transgenic plants grew and developed normally and were not adversely affected despite the presence of PB organelles and large amounts of fusion protein.</p><p>We investigated the accumulation of EGF in insect cells by baculovirus infection with Zera-EGF. Sf9 cells accumulated Zera-EGF to remarkably high levels, exceeding 15% of total protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> lane 2). In contrast, EGF accumulated to much lower levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> lane l) in cells infected with virus containing constructs lacking Zera. In fact, EGF in these cells was not detectable by silver or Coomassie staining, and was only faintly visualized by immunoblot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> arrowhead). Cryosections of Zera-EGF infected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) showed the presence of abundant electron-dense structures which were absent in non-infected Sf9 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

We explored whether Zera-protein fusions could be isolated from crude cell or tissue extracts by virtue of the high density of Zera-induced PBs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Leaf homogenate extracts from Zera-EGF transgenic tobacco plants were fractionated on density gradients and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using anti-Zera and anti-BiP antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Most of the Zera-EGF protein was recovered in the dense 1.18 to 1.26 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>sucrose gradient interface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, F3), with some present in the ER fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, F2). BiP also partitioned with the PB-containing fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, F3), in agreement with the immunoelectron microscopy findings for Zera-Ct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). Zera-protein fusions could also be recovered by density from transformed filamentous fungi and insect cells extracts. In <italic>Trichoderma </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>), Zera-GFP was detectable by both direct Coomassie staining and immunoblotting following gel electrophoresis of dense particles isolated on sucrose density gradients. In controls lacking Zera no GFP could be isolated in high-density fractions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, compare lanes F3). As in plants and fungi, dense PB-like structures from Zera-EGF-expressing Sf9 cells were readily isolated by density gradients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). Zera-EGF fusion protein but not EGF could be recovered from crude lysates in the 1.18 to 1.26 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>sucrose gradient interface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, lanes F3). It should be noted that low-speed direct centrifugation of the homogenates, while less efficient than gradients (which enriched the fusion protein up to 85% in a single density separation following cell lysis) was also able to effect substantial concentration and purification of Zera fusions (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>PBs isolation by density and Zera-fusion proteins recovery</bold>. <bold>(A-C) </bold>Protein analysis of fractions collected from a sucrose gradient of Zera-EGF tobacco leaf homogenates. <bold>(A) </bold>Immunoblot (&#x003b1;R8 antibody) shows Zera-EGF primarily in the dense F3 fraction (1.18 to 1.26 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>interface, arrow). <bold>(B) </bold>Immunoblot using anti-BiP antibody indicates that the soluble ER chaperone co-sediments with Zera-EGF in the F3 fraction. <bold>(C) </bold>Silver stained SDS-PAGE of sucrose fractions showing the enrichment of Zera-EGF in the F3 fraction.

These organelles retain many of the beneficial characteristics of cereal seed PBs, including the physical properties of high local concentration within a discrete membrane-bound structure that allows efficient isolation by simple density-based protocols, sub-cellular sequestration that facilitates protein accumulation preventing adverse metabolic interactions, and association with molecular chaperones that may facilitate folding and enable functional and stable expression of enzymes and human proteins. Remarkably, the mechanism by which the ER of cereal seeds segregates storage proteins away from normal secretory transport and accumulates them into PB organelles appears to be conserved between plants, fungi, insects and animal cells. This finding suggests that PB biogenesis may be related to general cis-mediated biophysical interactions of the ER with the Zera structure rather than depending on trans-factor associated processes such as receptor-mediated signaling. The mechanism by which Zera forms these novel cell organelles is not yet fully characterized, but an important contributing factor is likely to be the physico-chemical properties of the PPPVHL repeat domain of Zera. This domain folds <italic>in vitro </italic>into an amphipathic poly-Proline II conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] that in turn forms an expanded helix able to assemble both with itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and with membrane lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Besides the specific properties derived from its amphipathic nature, the Zera domain also contains six cysteine residues, which may serve to stabilize nascent assembled Zera complexes via intermolecular disulfide bonds. Studies of PB formation in tobacco plants expressing a chimeric storage protein created by fusion of the maize &#x003b3; zein proline-rich domain and the legume storage protein phaseolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] suggests that &#x003b3; zein Cys residues contribute to fusion protein polymerization and accumulation in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Recombinant protein accumulation was clearly enhanced by using Zera. This enhancement has been observed with several proteins expressed in different eukaryotic hosts with and without fusion to Zera. Recombinant hGH accumulated 13 times more when transiently expressed as Zera-hGH in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>, while the differential accumulation of recombinant EGF as a fusion was 100-fold greater than EGF alone (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These high levels of fusion protein accumulation in PBs suggest that in addition to organellar sequestration, Zera protein condensation may also provide a mechanism for such fusions to evade the normal ER degradative pathways. The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] is induced transcriptionally in all eukaryotic cells in response to the presence of unfolded proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This mechanism is conserved from yeast to humans and affects both endogenous and heterologous proteins. High accumulation of Zera fusions assembled into heterologous PBs may therefore reflect poor recognition by the ERAD pathway and/or inefficient delivery of fusions to the cytosol for proteolysis following ERAD pathway entry.</p><p>In addition, accumulation of recombinant Zera fusion proteins apparently does not alter normal host cell growth and development, and neither predisposes such cells to apoptosis nor perturbs the normal functionality of the secretory pathway. It is well known that if the rate of synthesis of a given protein exceeds the rates of folding and degradation the resultant over-accumulation in the ER usually triggers apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Our results suggest that this is not the case for PB-accumulated proteins, as we observed that 1) transgenic Zera plants germinated, were fertile and developed identically to wild-type plants; 2) apoptosis profiles and proliferation rates of CHO cells over-expressing Zera fusion proteins were similar to non-transfected CHO cells; and 3) fungal cells expressing Zera fusions grew normally and vigorously despite accumulating large intracellular PBs. Naturally occurring ER-derived structures sequestering aberrant proteins have been observed previously in mammals. Such structures include the so-called Russell bodies found in non-apoptotic plasma cells of multiple myeloma and AIDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These structures are thought to arise from dilated ER cisternae that sequester condensed immunoglobulins that might otherwise trigger deleterious cellular responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The broad species conservation of PB induction may therefore reflect an ancestral protective response to mitigate the potentially adverse effects of protein over-accumulation in the ER. Taken together, our observations of high intracellular accumulation, enhanced recombinant protein stability, and the lack of adverse metabolic consequences for the expressing host cell all suggest that sequestration within membrane-bound PBs serves as an effective means to isolate the cell and recombinant target protein from one another.</p><p>An additional key consideration for recombinant protein production is the efficiency of downstream recovery and purification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Packaging of recombinant protein into dense organelles that are easily concentrated from cell lysates provides a significant enrichment of pre-purification titer prior to chromatographic separation or capture steps. The resulting density-fractionated Zera protein fusions can be readily purified following disaggregation under mild reducing conditions. This creates an opportunity to design improved downstream purification protocols that may be less costly than current approaches. Currently, downstream purification comprises the bulk of the costs associated with recombinant protein biopharmaceutical manufacture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Zera sequence provides an efficient and universal means to produce recombinant proteins by accumulation in ER-derived organelles. This intracellular storage and sequestration system evades the normal cellular protein degradation mechanisms and does not perturb cell metabolism. The PB structures formed by Zera fusions share many of the advantageous storage properties of bona fide cereal seed PBs, including the presence of eukaryotic chaperones to facilitate recombinant protein folding, high densities that allow simple downstream target protein concentration by PB capture, and insulation of PB contents from proteolytic and enzymatic activities of the cytosol. Transferring the seed-type attributes conferred by PB sequestration to proven eukaryotic cell-based and transgenic expression systems creates unique opportunities for improving biological manufacturing. Such an approach is of particular interest for polypeptides which are poorly secreted, host-toxic, or otherwise challenging to produce.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>Plasmid pUC18Zera coding for the Zera N-terminal &#x003b3; zein coding sequence (Zera, RX3 sequence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] was obtained after amplification of the DNA sequence coding for the Zera domain by PCR using the vector pKSG2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] as template and suitable oligonucleotides as primers.
