Because of the urgent need for infection control interventions and for rapid distribution of information about emerging organisms, we initiated the International Network for the Study and Prevention of Emerging Antimicrobial Resistance (INSPEAR). Its main objectives are to serve as an early warning system for emerging antimicrobial-drug resistant pathogens, to facilitate rapid distribution of information about emerging multidrug-resistant pathogens to hospitals and public health authorities worldwide, and to serve as a model for the development and implementation of infection control interventions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
