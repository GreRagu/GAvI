Diabetes in humans is classified into two main types: type 1 diabetes, where the pathophysiology is autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells; and type 2 diabetes, where insulin resistance is central to the disease process together with a nonimmune-mediated &#x003b2;-cell failure relative to insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). Limited data in the pediatric literature suggest that the pathophysiology of youth type 2 diabetes is a combination of severe insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>).</p><p>The diagnosis of youth type 2 diabetes is typically made using clinical criteria where obesity is the major diagnostic entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). However, with the increasing rates of obesity in childhood, particularly in children with type 1 diabetes, this clinical distinction has become ever more difficult and imperfect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). A number of youth with a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes have evidence of islet-cell autoimmunity, with autoantibodies present in 10&#x02013;75&#x00025; of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). Several theories and terminologies have been proposed, such as hybrid diabetes, double diabetes, diabetes type 1.5, and latent autoimmune diabetes of youth, to refer to and to try to explain the underlying pathophysiology in this subset of young patients with a clinical phenotype consistent with type 2 diabetes and evidence of autoimmunity consistent with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). Efforts to identify distinguishing features of antibody-positive (Ab<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and -negative (Ab<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetes in youth, which are typically focused on clinical features such as obesity, acanthosis nigricans, symptoms at diagnosis, ketonuria, A1C, and insulin requirements, have not revealed any unique distinctive features that would differentiate one from the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). To our knowledge, no data exist in the pediatric literature regarding the metabolic characteristics of youth with a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with versus without islet cell antibodies. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that youth with clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetes and positive islet cell antibodies have greater impairment of &#x003b2;-cell function and are less insulin resistant than their peers with clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetes who are autoantibody negative. Our objectives were <italic>1</italic>) to compare in vivo insulin sensitivity and secretion in Ab<sup>&#x02212;</sup> versus Ab<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> youth with clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetes and in obese control subjects and <italic>2</italic>) to assess whether differences exist between the two groups of clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients in clinical and/or laboratory features at the time of diagnosis or during the research evaluation.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study population.</title><p>Forty-two obese adolescents with a clinical diagnoses of type 2 diabetes made by the attending endocrinologist were recruited from the Diabetes Center at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Screening for islet cell antibodies (details below) revealed 16 with negative antibodies and 26 with positive antibodies. Some of the Ab<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> patients were initially screened for the Treatment Options of Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth Trial (TODAY) (Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh is one of 15 participating centers in TODAY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>) and found to be ineligible because of the presence of islet cell antibodies. Some of the Ab<sup>&#x02212;</sup> patients later participated in TODAY. The control group consisted of 39 age-matched obese but otherwise healthy adolescents who were recruited from the community through a local newspaper advertisement and flyers posted on bus routes and the medical campus. Thirteen of the 42 subjects with type 2 diabetes and all of the obese control subjects were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). Pubertal development was assessed by physical examination according to Tanner criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). At the time of study participation, 9 subjects with clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetes were receiving lifestyle modification and no medications, 6 patients were on insulin alone, 13 were on metformin alone, and 14 were on insulin together with metformin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). This type of therapy is typical of pediatric diabetes clinical practices nationwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). Besides the type 2 diabetes treatment, none of the participants were receiving any medication that may have impacted glucose metabolism, and none of the females were on oral contraceptive pills at the time of the study. The characteristics of the study population are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. All studies were approved by the institutional review board of the University of Pittsburgh. Informed consent and assent were obtained from each participant and their legal guardians. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of type 2 diabetic youth at the time of diagnosis, including presence of symptoms, ketones, glucose levels, A1C, and treatment modality and/or insulin use at diagnosis were obtained from the medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>Autoantibody testing.</title><p>Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-kDa autoantibody (GAD65-Ab) and insulinoma-associated protein-2 autoantibody (IA2 Ab) measurements were performed at the Northwest Lipid Metabolism and Diabetes Research Laboratories, University of Washington (Seattle, WA). This is the same reference laboratory with identical antibody determination for the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded multicenter TODAY study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). Briefly, both GAD and IA2 were determined by a radioligand-binding assay, using either GAD65 or IA2 proteins produced by an in vitro transcription and translation system and labeled with &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;methionine. Levels of both GAD65-Ab and IA2 Ab were expressed as indexes, with the cutoff for positivity set at the 99th percentile of normal. Subjects with GAD65-Ab index &#x0003e;0.085 and/or IA2 Ab index &#x0003e;0.018 were considered to be GAD65-Ab<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and/or IA2-Ab<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, respectively. Patients were considered to be Ab<sup>&#x02212;</sup> if both antibody indexes were below the cutoff. These are the same cutoffs used in TODAY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Clamp studies.</title><p>Participants were admitted twice within a 1- to 4-week period (except for three control subjects within 6&#x02013;8 weeks) to the Pediatric Clinical and Translational Research Center the day before the clamp studies: once for a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and once for a hyperglycemic clamp&#x02014; in random order. Each clamp evaluation was performed after a 10- to 12-h overnight fast. Metformin and long-acting insulin were discontinued 48 h before the clamp studies as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). For each study, two intravenous catheters were inserted after the skin and subcutaneous tissues were anesthetized with eutectic mixture of local anesthetics cream (Astra Pharmaceutical Products, West Borough, MA). One catheter was placed in a vein on the forearm for administration of glucose, insulin, and stable isotopes; the second catheter was placed in a vein in the dorsum of the contralateral heated hand for sampling of arterialized venous blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>In vivo glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.</title><p>Fasting endogenous hepatic glucose production (HGP) was measured with a primed (2.2 &#x003bc;mol/kg) constant rate infusion of &#x0005b;6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>&#x0005d;glucose (0.31 &#x000b1; 0.01 &#x003bc;mol &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in type 2 diabetic patients and 0.30 &#x000b1; 0.01 &#x003bc;mol &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in obese control subjects) (Isotech, Miamisburg, OH) from 7:30&#x02013;9:30 <sc>a.m.</sc>, as we described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Blood was sampled at the start of the stable isotope infusion (&#x02212;120 min) and every 10 min from &#x02212;30 to 0 min (basal period) for determination of plasma glucose, insulin, and isotopic enrichment of glucose. Calculations for fasting HGP were made over the last 30 min of the 2-h isotope infusion (&#x02212;30 to 0 min).</p><p>After the 2-h baseline isotope infusion period, insulin-mediated glucose metabolism and in vivo insulin sensitivity were measured during a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp from 9:30 <sc>a.m.</sc>-12:30 <sc>p.m.</sc>, in conjunction with indirect calorimetry. Intravenous crystalline insulin (Humulin Regular; Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) was infused at a constant rate of 80 mU &#x000b7; m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and plasma glucose was clamped at 5.5 mmol/l with a variable rate infusion of 20&#x00025; dextrose as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). Continuous indirect calorimetry by a ventilated hood system (Deltatrac Metabolic Monitor; Sensormedics, Anaheim, CA) was performed to measure CO<sub>2</sub> production, O<sub>2</sub> consumption, and respiratory quotient for 30 min at baseline and at the end of the clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>In vivo insulin secretion.</title><p>First- and second-phase insulin secretion were assessed during a 2-h hyperglycemic clamp (12.5 mmol/l) performed from 9:00&#x02013;11:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations were measured every 2.5 min (at 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 min, first phase) and then every 5 min for glucose and every 15 min for insulin and C-peptide. Before the start of the clamp, a fasting blood sample was obtained for total HDL, LDL, and VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Body composition.</title><p>Body composition was determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.

In one study, 11&#x00025; of clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetic youth were positive for all four autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). These studies, however, had very limited numbers of patients from different racial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). Some of these studies investigated but could not find clinically distinguishing features between patients with or without &#x003b2;-cell antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). A preliminary report of a much larger scale of 432 youth with clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetes screened in TODAY study revealed that 17.4&#x00025; were positive for one or both of the antibodies GAD and IA-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Ab<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> versus Ab<sup>&#x02212;</sup> subjects did not differ in age, diabetes duration, BMI <italic>Z</italic> score, and lipid levels; however, there seemed to be a tendency for C-peptide to be lower and A1C to be higher in Ab<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>).</p><p>Studies investigating the pathophysiology of youth type 2 diabetes are very limited and have conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). In one of the earliest studies, first-phase insulin response during a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test was lower in type 2 diabetic patients compared with obese control subjects with no difference in insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). This was in contrast with another study where insulin sensitivity was lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>) in type 2 diabetes. However, despite lower insulin response to IVGTT, integrated insulin and C-peptide levels during the OGTT were not different between type 2 diabetic patients and obese as well as lean control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). In the former study, &#x003b2;-cell antibodies were not measured, and in the latter it is not clear which, how many, and how antibodies were measured. In our previous publication, GAD and ICA antibodies were measured commercially, and only type 2 diabetic patients adolescents with negative antibodies were reported and shown to have &#x0223c;50&#x00025; lower insulin sensitivity and relative insulin deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). In another study of six adolescents with type 2 diabetes and negative GAD, IA-2, and ICA, besides marked insulin resistance, the impairment in &#x003b2;-cell function was highly variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). In another study of 10 obese youth with type 2 diabetes negative for GAD, ICA and IA2, glucose sensitivity of first- and second-phase &#x003b2;-cell secretion was significantly lower in type 2 diabetic patients compared with obese youth, whereas insulin sensitivity was similar between the groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). Potential explanations for these variable findings could be differences in study population and ethnicity, differences in diabetes duration and therapeutic modalities, differences in methodologies, and differences in measuring antibodies. In the present investigation, we elected to use the same laboratory that was deemed most appropriate for the NIH-funded multicenter TODAY study. Our current results suggest that youth who are clinically diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but negative for the two tested antibodies have severe impairment of insulin action, both in glucose and fat metabolism, which is over and beyond that due to obesity since there were no differences in total and abdominal obesity between them and the other two groups. Furthermore, the presence of higher blood pressure and higher ALT would suggest that this group has an inherent insulin resistance that is typical of the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). On the other hand, patients clinically diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but positive antibodies have severe impairment in &#x003b2;-cell function, whereas their insulin action is significantly better than Ab<sup>&#x02212;</sup> patients and near identical to obese nondiabetic control subjects. This suggests that the major abnormality is in insulin secretion and not insulin action, which is typical of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Thus, it is our proposition that these patients are merely obese children who happen to develop autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Moreover, our limited data would suggest that there could be a dose-response phenomenon because first- and second-phase insulin secretion in patients who are positive for double antibodies is &#x0223c;50&#x00025; lower than that of patients who are positive for a single antibody. Previous limited studies from a single group of investigators found that some youth clinically classified with type 2 diabetes or indeterminant diabetes (admixture of clinical features of types 1 and 2: type 1.5) show T-cell reactivity to islet proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>) and have type 1 diabetes&#x02013;associated HLA alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Baseline C-peptide levels in the type 1.5 diabetic patients were significantly lower than those in patients classified as type 2 diabetic and higher than those in patients classified as type 1 diabetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). The findings in our study provide direct evidence to the more severe degree of impairment in &#x003b2;-cell function in Ab<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> patients proposed in the aforementioned study. The more frequent ketonuria at diagnosis in Ab<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> patients may be a reflection of the severity of &#x003b2;-cell impairment and has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>).</p><p>It is not surprising that despite significantly more severe impairment in &#x003b2;-cell function in the Ab<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> group, there was no difference in the frequency of insulin treatment between the two groups of clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients either at diagnosis or at the time of the study (73&#x00025; Ab<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> vs. 62&#x00025; Ab<sup>&#x02212;</sup> at diagnosis, and 54&#x00025; vs. 38&#x00025; at the time of the study). Treatment of patients is frequently practitioner driven and not pathophysiology driven, and these rates of insulin treatment are consistent with the pediatric literature of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). The change in BMI from diagnosis to the time of research was not different between those patients initially treated with versus without insulin (data not shown).</p><p>Despite these important differences in insulin action and secretion between Ab<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and Ab<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, the GDI, which is insulin secretion corrected for the degree of insulin sensitivity, is not different. Our present metabolic observations are consistent with findings in GAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> adults with type 2 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). GAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> adult patients had decreased early insulin response; however, when this response was corrected for the degree of insulin sensitivity, GAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and GAD<sup>&#x02212;</sup> patients had similar &#x003b2;-cell function. Thus, in the absence of careful metabolic studies using sensitive tools, it will be difficult to discern the underlying pathways: impaired insulin action versus &#x003b2;-cell function, which may result in similar GDI. However, such knowledge is important to help guide pathophysiology- based therapy amid the multiple terminologies used: double diabetes, hybrid diabetes, diabetes type 1.5, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, important metabolic differences exist in insulin sensitivity and secretion between obese youth with versus without evidence of pancreatic autoantibodies. These metabolic differences highlight different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms between the two groups despite a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Finally, it remains to be determined whether the natural history of diabetes and/or response to treatment and/or micro- and macrovascular complications differ between Ab<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Ab<sup>&#x02212;</sup> clinically diagnosed obese youth with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>F.B. has received support from the Thrasher Research Fund.
