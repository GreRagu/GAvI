In Turkey, two schools were selected by cluster sampling from high and low socio-economic suburbs to represent the general profile of that district. In Finland, two primary schools were randomly chosen to represent the pre-adolescents living in Helsinki. The sample selection is described elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-0020153">19</xref></p><p>Self-administered health behaviour questionnaires meant for these pre-adolescents and their mothers were revised after testing in a pilot study in 2003 on a sample of fourth-grade elementary school pre-adolescents (n=63) in Istanbul.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-0020153">10</xref></p><p>The Turkish Ministry of Education, the local administration authorities, and the school authorities in Turkey as well as the Ethics Committee of Finland granted ethical clearance and written permission to conduct the study. All of the participating mothers and pre-adolescents provided written informed consent.</p><p>Two native speakers translated the questionnaires from English to Turkish and Finnish to ensure accuracy compared with the original forms in English. The oral health behaviour questionnaires meant for the pre-adolescents were completed in classes, whereas those for mothers were taken home and returned from their homes by the pre-adolescents during the following two weeks.</p><p>The pre-adolescents&#x02019; number of decayed, missing, and filled permanent (DMFT) was measured by dental examinations in Turkey and Finland, based on WHO criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-0020153">20</xref> In Finland, children under 18 years of age are entitled to comprehensive regular oral health care free of charge, and their dental health records are regularly collected by dentists in the municipal public health centers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-0020153">21</xref> Each dentist follows detailed guidelines and treatment decisions outlined by the Helsinki City Health Department according to WHO criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-0020153">20</xref> For this study, oral health data of Finnish pre-adolescents were taken from the records stored at the Helsinki City Health Department with permission.</p><p>The dental examinations in Turkey were carried out in the classrooms two weeks before the survey by two calibrated paediatric dentists who worked professionally in dental university clinics. The dental examinations were performed under field conditions using natural light. The pre-adolescent was seated in a chair with a high backrest; the examiner stood in front of the chair. Plane mouth mirrors and blunt dental probes were used for the examination. Following WHO recommendations,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-0020153">20</xref> the examiners first recorded caries on dental charts, in terms of DMFT/dmft (number of decayed, missing, and filled permanent/primary teeth) and DMFS/dmfs (number of decayed, missing, and filled surfaces of permanent/primary teeth). Those scores for each pre-adolescent were calculated, and lesions were recorded as present when a carious cavity was detected on manual inspection. In the present study, only DMFT scores were used. Of the study group, 10% were re-examined for inter-examiner and intra-examiner reliability of DMFT (0.89; 0.96, 0.92), respectively (P&#x0003c;.05). DMFT values of both groups were dichotomized into healthy (DMFT=0) and diseased (DMFT&#x0003e;0) subgroups for further analysis.</p><p>Behavioural capital measures were selected from the pre-adolescent oral health behaviour questionnaire that was designed to survey pre-adolescents&#x02019; self-reported oral health and behaviour and psychological measures. The design of those measures, Tooth-brushing Self-efficacy (TBSES) and Modified Self-esteem were described in earlier studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-0020153">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-0020153">19</xref> Sum scores for TBSES were coded as low and high by taking the medians as the cut offs;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-0020153">22</xref> 4 for the Turkish and 9 for the Finnish pre-adolescents. The Modified Self-esteem Scale,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-0020153">23</xref> composed of nine items, each ranging along a three-point scale (agree=1 to disagree=3), was coded with medians as cut-off points, 4 for Turks and 5 for Finns.</p><p>A maternal oral health behaviour questionnaire, modified from Pine et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-0020153">24</xref> analyses family-related factors and oral health behaviours, along with health capital measures (body height and weight) of pre-adolescents. Number of children in the family, family type, and time spent with mother (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-0020153">Table 1</xref>) were used as the family-related indicators related to family context as defined in the life-course approach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-0020153">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-0020153">26</xref> Mothers were asked in the maternal questionnaires to measure height to the nearest 0.1 cm and weight to the nearest 0.1 kg with pre-adolescents standing wearing only underwear in bare feet, standing erect against a wall-mounted measuring tape. Parents were not to include earlier measurements available, and to have new measurements after the arrival of the questionnaires at homes. Of the Turkish study group, 10% of mothers were asked to re-complete the maternal health behaviour questionnaires two weeks after the cessation of the survey. Intra-examiner reliability for the measurement of the height (the Spearman Brown coefficient) was rs=0.789, and was rs=0.747 for the weight (P&#x0003c;.05). Further, intraclass correlation was applied to test the reliability of the scales and it was rI=0.788 and rI=0.746 (P&#x0003c;.001), respectively, for the Turkish and Finnish pre-adolescents.</p><p>The Turkish response rate was 97% for the oral health behaviour questionnaire for the pre-adolescents (n=591; 345 public- and 246 private school pre-adolescents) and 87% for that of the mothers (n=533; 334 public- and 199 private school mothers). The participation rate totalled 95% for participation in dental examinations by the pre-adolescents (n=584; 348 public- and 236 private school pre-adolescents). Finnish data showed a response rate for pre-adolescents of 65% (n=223), and for their mothers 53% (n=180). The Finnish dental examination rate was 65%. Boys comprised 57% of the Finnish and 51% of the Turkish population.</p><p>Descriptive statistics, frequency distributions were performed and for each further statistical analysis, those mother-pre-adolescent pairs not responding the body-height measures, 14% (n=74) and 14% (n=25) among Turkish and Finnish pre-adolescents, were extracted. Therefore mother-pre-adolescents pairs included in further analysis were n=459 for the Turks and n=155 for the Finns. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation and the contingency coefficient for determining associations between variables were applied. The Chi-square (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) test by cross-tabulation was used to compare frequencies, and the corresponding odds ratios were calculated. In addition, Student t-test was applied. The statistical significance was set at P&#x0003c;.05.</p><p>Logistic regression analysis was then conducted to determine the DMFT and its association with health- and behavioural capital measures of pre-adolescents, and family-related characteristics, after adjusting for gender and age.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Mean DMFT for Finnish pre-adolescents (0.74&#x000b1;1.57) was lower than that of their Turkish counterparts (2.96&#x000b1;2.03) (P&#x0003c;.05). Turkish pre-adolescents were more dentally diseased (84%) than were the Finnish (33%), (P&#x0003c;.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-0020153">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-0020153">Table 1</xref> shows the measures of health- and behavioural capital and family-related characteristics. Mean body height and weight of Finnish pre-adolescents were higher than those of the Turkish (P=.01). High levels of self-esteem and tooth-brushing self-efficacy (above the median cut-off points) were reported at a similar percentage among Turkish and Finnish pre-adolescents (P&#x0003e;.05). Finnish pre-adolescents, compared to their Turkish counterparts, were less likely to live in two-parent families (OR=0.22: CI95% 0.14 -0.36), (P=.001) and spent less time with their mothers (P&#x0003c;.05).</p><p>Body height and weight of Turkish pre-adolescents were inversely correlated with number of children in the family (rp=&#x02212;0.154, rp=&#x02212;0.216, P&#x0003c;.01). Turkish pre-adolescents with high levels of self-esteem were more likely to spend time with their mothers (P&#x0003c;.05) and less likely to live in families with three or more children (28%) than were their counterparts with low levels of self-esteem (41%) (OR=0.57: CI95%=0.16&#x02013;0.82), (P=.002).

This association, as also found by Nicolau et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-0020153">5</xref> speaks for understanding the impact of family-related disadvantages, either economic or social or both, on developmental patterns and dental health of the pre-adolescent over the whole life span.</p><p>A higher number of children in the family reflects early-life socio-economic disadvantages in the life-course-approach; as family size grows, human and material resources diminish.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-0020153">19</xref> In the present study, the Turkish pre-adolescents living in families with a higher number of children were more likely to have caries and shorter body height. This has also been shown among adolescents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-0020153">5</xref> Additionally, the negative correlation found between weight and number of children in the family among the Turkish pre-adolescents may result from the contribution of low socio-economic status to consumption of food inadequate in nutrition, as suggested earlier.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-0020153">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-0020153">29</xref></p><p>Finnish pre-adolescents with high levels of caries were more likely to have lower body height and higher weight, to come from single-parent families, and to spend less time with the mother. Finnish adolescents living in single-parent families, a situation increasing in Finland, are more likely to be at increased risk for health problems,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-0020153">28</xref> and financial difficulties.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-0020153">31</xref> They are also more likely to consume snacks if they spend less time with their parents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-0020153">32</xref> These patterns may signal the association between caries and obesity, as recently found by Willershausen et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-0020153">16</xref> in the light of early studies that have found obesity and higher caries rates to be associated with family-related economic and social disadvantages such as single-parent family and poor parenting (e.g., parental punishment, less time spent with child).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-0020153">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-0020153">33</xref></p><p>To our knowledge, among school-aged children the relation between caries and self-esteem has not been investigated before. Studies on the self-esteem of children and adolescents in dentistry mostly focus on dental health behaviour and have found pre-adolescents and adolescents with low levels of self-esteem brushing their teeth twice a day less frequently.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-0020153">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-0020153">34</xref> Self-esteem, a component of behavioural capital, contributed to caries among Turkish pre-adolescents. The WHO suggested self-esteem to be an initiative of oral health-promoting schools toward adoption of positive health behaviours and enhancement of the oral health status of school children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-0020153">14</xref> This approach may be essential in reducing the gap in oral health inequalities among children and adolescents, because development of self-esteem is positively related to better family related characteristics such as socio-economic status<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-0020153">35</xref> and to positive maternal influence such as in rearing attitudes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-0020153">36</xref> The present findings are further evidence for the facts that having an increased number of siblings and negative maternal influence (less time spent with mother) contribute to lower levels of self-esteem among Turkish pre-adolescents.</p><p>Even though these measurements of body height and weight by self-reports may be considered as possibly biased, parent-reported body measurements for adolescents have been shown to be reliable and valid.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-0020153">37</xref> As the aim concerned the association between health capital (body height-weight) and DMFT, separately for Turkish and Finnish pre-adolescents, the genetic or other factors that may lead to differences on health capital measures between these countries was out of concern. In both countries, oral health data were collected by use of standardized recording criteria that are also practical and reliable under field conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-0020153">20</xref> Since there is no national dental data bank in Turkey, the use of standardized diagnostic criteria facilitates other comparisons, as found earlier between two countries with differing oral health care systems, respectively similar to those in Turkey and Finland.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-0020153">38</xref> The family-related characteristics used in the present study are also used in cross-sectional studies utilizing the life-course approach,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-0020153">25</xref> generating hypotheses on different pathways to explain the associations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-0020153">39</xref> Life-course factors can be measured by reliable self-reports among pre-adolescents, because children are already sufficiently aware of these factors in the beginning of pre-adolescence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-0020153">40</xref></p><p>The limitation of this study is its cross sectional nature. There seems to be need for the follow-up studies considering the association of dental caries experience with health- and behavioural capital among pre-adolescents starting from childhood to identify and improve their well-being. Furthermore, the present study speaks for a limited number of participants and there is need for further research with larger sample size.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The dental health of pre-adolescents is interrelated with health- and behavioral capital in different pathways under the influence of social and economic factors experienced in family life. This interrelation functions in populations both with and without a wide range of socio-economic inequalities, such as are represented by Turkey and Finland. Specifically, in Turkey, with no prevention-oriented oral health care system and with social deprivation, the cooperation of pediatricians and dentists is necessary in assessment of general and dental health in a holistic context throughout the life-course, to enhance the well-being of pre-adolescents. Regardless of the complexity of the issue, interventions to promote pre-adolescent dental health through the life-course approach are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-0020153"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
