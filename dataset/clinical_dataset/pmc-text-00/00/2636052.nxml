In the region of the coloboma, there is usuallysome defect in the zonules and hence the resultant coloboma.Cases with duplicated lens that is a single eye carrying twolenses, have been described. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> The exact mechanism for thisanomaly is not known yet. Our case serves to explain theconnection between lens coloboma and duplicated lens.</p><sec sec-type=""><title>Case History</title><p>A young boy, 16 years old, presented with complaints of poorvision in the left eye since childhood. There was no history ofany treatment or surgical intervention. In addition, no historypertaining to any trauma was given. Birth history was notsignificant. On examination, he had a vision of 20/200 in theright eye (RE) and 20/20 in the left eye (LE). The LE was clinicallynormal with a normal fundus. The RE revealed a horizontallyplaced bilobed lens sharing a common capsular bag. Zonuleswere lacking around the fissure between the two lobes [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>].Also, there was an inferior iris coloboma. Fundus was normalin both eyes. An ultrasonogram of the right eye [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>] revealeda bilobed lens in the anterior segment of the eye with normalposterior segment.</p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Discussion</title><p>Congenital anomalies of the lens are varied. Partial congenitalaphakia is a rare condition in which the lens appears to bepartially divided by a deep furrow.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p><p>In the case of congenital duplication of lens reported byThakkar <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> two lenses were placed obliquely in a straight linewith a clear area in between. Absence of zonules and capsulebetween the two lenses was also noted. Richardson<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> reporteda case in which the two lenses were asymmetrical, one beinglarger than the other. The patient also had corneal metaplasia,complete coloboma of iris and fundus.</p><p>The mechanism for this anomaly is not known yet. Whetherit is part of a phylentogenic spectra or represents developmentfrom two embryonically separate lens remains a question. DukeElder has tried to explain the occurrence of the two entitiesbased on separate embryonic developmental sequences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Hesuggested that the metaplastic changes in the surface ectodermleads the lens plate to invaginate at two place and forms twolens vesicles which results in double lens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> This suggests thatthe lens is divided before the lens starts developing.</p><p>Our case has a deep furrow in the center <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> withlocalized absence of zonules. We, therefore, suggest that oncethe deep furrow is formed due to absence of zonules, it maygo further (deep) enough to divide the lens into two distinctparts. Therefore, the absence of zonules is significant and thesefurrows may be deep enough and progress to duplication. Itis a possibility that the lens duplication might be occurringwhen the lens vesicle is single and it is the laxity and abnormalstretching which causes the deep furrow and possiblyduplication. Duplication may be the extreme form of such abilobed, furrowed lens. It is interesting to note that both thecases previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> had lens place in a straight axis atopposite ends. This gives further credence to our theory of thefissure dividing the lens into two and the remaining zonulespulling them away from each other.</p><p>Since lens coloboma occurs frequently such deep furrows(bilobed lens) are uncommon. We believe that it represents themissing link between the colobomatous lens and duplicatedlens. We understand that a single case report may not besuggestive of any mechanism but nevertheless it does indicatea possible mechanism of lens duplication.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Elder</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anomalies of lens</article-title><source>System of ophthalmology</source><year>1969</year><publisher-loc>Henry Kempton</publisher-loc><fpage>688</fpage><lpage>741</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thakkar</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Congenital double crystalline lens</article-title><source>J Cataract Refract Surg</source><year>2003</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>405</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12648659</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Congenital anomalies of the anterior segment</article-title><source>Trans Can Ophthalmol Soc</source><year>1951</year><volume>14</volume><fpage>102</fpage><lpage>3</lpage></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back><floats-group><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Slit-lamp photograph of the right eye showing horizontallyplaced bilobed lens.
