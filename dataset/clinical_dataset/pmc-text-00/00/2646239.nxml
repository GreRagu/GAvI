The field is rapidly gaining importance: it promises drugs targeted to particular subpopulations based on genetic background. The pharmacogenomics literature has expanded rapidly, but is dispersed in many journals. It is challenging, therefore, to identify important associations between drugs and molecular entities &#x02013; particularly genes and gene variants, and thus these critical connections are often lost. Text mining techniques can allow us to convert the free-style text to a computable, searchable format in which pharmacogenomic concepts (such as genes, drugs, polymorphisms, and diseases) are identified, and important links between these concepts are recorded. Availability of full text articles as input into text mining engines is key, as literature abstracts often do not contain sufficient information to identify these pharmacogenomic associations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thus, building on a tool called Textpresso, we have created the Pharmspresso tool to assist in identifying important pharmacogenomic facts in full text articles. Pharmspresso parses text to find references to human genes, polymorphisms, drugs and diseases and their relationships. It presents these as a series of marked-up text fragments, in which key concepts are visually highlighted. To evaluate Pharmspresso, we used a gold standard of 45 human-curated articles. Pharmspresso identified 78%, 61%, and 74% of target gene, polymorphism, and drug concepts, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pharmspresso is a text analysis tool that extracts pharmacogenomic concepts from the literature automatically and thus captures our current understanding of gene-drug interactions in a computable form.

However, pharmacogenomics is a dynamic field with a growing literature, and this wealth of published information can be difficult to track because it is published in many discipline-specific journals. To address this difficulty, researchers sometimes perform multiple searches repetitively &#x02013; differing only in their syntax but not semantics &#x02013; to find facts that match certain patterns. For example, a query template may be "{gene} VERB {drug}", where the {gene} and {drug} are a specific gene and drug of interest to the researcher, and the verb phrase is one of the following three: 'binds', 'interacts with', or 'associates with'. These searches are very similar, and yet must be performed separately to extract all articles that contain each of the particular triplets, as there is no existing method to search using a category that includes the three verb phrases. Text mining approaches may be useful in addressing this problem, because computational techniques can automatically scan, retrieve and summarize the literature and store it in a computable format. Search techniques such as PubMed and Google are keyword-based, and do not contain semantic information about desired relationships in text. Natural language processing has been applied to pharmacogenomics in the past [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], but there is an opportunity now to use it for extracting the connections between the entities of interest in pharmacogenomics. Template-based semantic search can allow these connections to be automatically extracted, building on the commonalities in the sentence structure. The templates must be tailored to the specific field of research, in order to incorporate the terms and categories of interest to the researcher.</p><p>Separate from the technical issues of information extraction is the choice of text corpus. A major limitation of many search methods is that only literature abstracts are indexed. However, the full text of the articles may offer improved performance.</p><p>Some systems can support semantic concept-based search or relationship extraction, including Relemed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], iHOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], Ingenuity Pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], GENIES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], CBioC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and GeneWays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], but these systems do not generally provide search within full text and visual mark-up of the search results within the local context.</p><p>The Textpresso search engine is a template-based text search engine developed for Model Organism databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Textpresso uses an expert-built ontology that contains categories of phrases and words of biological interest. Database curators and users specify particular types of objects and relationships of interest, and the system finds articles that match these. Textpresso is based on a large set of regular expressions written to find templated relationships in text. It indexes the full text of articles that are provided as PDF files. Constraints can be added to queries &#x02013; for example, specifying that two entities appear in the same sentence in the article. Highlighted search results allow the searcher to efficiently skim search results.</p><p>We hypothesized that with minor modifications Textpresso would be useful for the task of identifying and extracting pharmacogenomic relationships. In particular, we wanted to extend Textpresso to be useful for pharmacogenomics literature focusing on drugs, human genes, their variants, and the associated molecular and cellular phenotypes. Articles processed by our modified Textpresso (Pharmspresso) are selected to be relevant to pharmacogenomics based on previously reported tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows examples of categories and terms identified by Pharmspresso. We evaluated our extension by comparing the ability of Pharmspresso to extract information about genes, drugs and polymorphisms from 45 articles, to the performance of 11 human gold standard evaluators reading the same literature.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Pharmspresso ontology examples.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>CATEGORY TYPE</bold></td><td></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Biological entity</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Example words/phrases</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cell or cell group</td><td align="left">germ line cells, intenstines, sensory neurons</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cellular component*</td><td align="left">axons, integrins, mitochondrial membrane</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Disease</bold></td><td align="left">stroke, chronic leukemia, tuberculoma</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Drug</bold></td><td align="left">acebutolol, mechlorethamine, tartaric acid</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Gene</bold></td><td align="left">ABCB1, CYP2C9, coagulation factor V</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Organism</td><td align="left">mice, rat, xenopus laevis</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Polymorphism</bold></td><td align="left">T168N, 1039G-A, 236Arg-&#x0003e;Lys</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Relationships between entities</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Example words/phrases</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Action</td><td align="left">assists, acomplishes, recognizes</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Association</td><td align="left">associates, binds, interacts</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Biological Process*</td><td align="left">acetylated, matures, reactivations</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Characterization</td><td align="left">has, contains, displays, includes, lacks</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Comparison</td><td align="left">correlates, differs, equally, matches</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Effect</td><td align="left">accumulates, aggregates, causes</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Examples of Textpresso biological entities and relationships, along with additions for Pharmspresso (in bold).

For example, a user may require a relationship synonymous with "association" or "effect" to be found within a sentence. In particular, patterns such as "{drug} {association} {gene}" can be found by querying for sentences containing these three categories. Specific instantiations of {gene}, such as 'CYP2C19', can be sought by querying for the keyword 'CYP2C19' with the categories {drug} and {association}. For example, the article by Ha-Duong et al. titled 'Ticlopidine as a selective mechanism-based inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 2C19', includes the following sentence retrieved by Pharmspresso: "Spectral interaction studies demonstrate that <bold>ticlopidine </bold>readily <bold>binds </bold>to the protein active site of <bold>CYP2C19</bold>" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmspresso finds information not present in abstracts alone</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows the result of a query that finds no relevant sentences from the article abstract, but does find a sentence in the full text.

Although the 'star notation' (*2, *3) is used earlier in the article to describe gene variants, explicit genomic location information which can be used to map this polymorphism is first given in sentence 132.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2105-10-S2-S6-5"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Pharmspresso retrieves fact from referenced article</bold>.

It provides a search engine for finding entities and semantic relationships between them of pharmacogenomic importance. Pharmspresso identifies relationships because it has a model of the words used to associate different concepts. Its display allows users quickly to browse through search results.</p><p>Because Pharmspresso uses regular expressions that may be imprecise, it can retrieve false positive search results. For example, in one article (PMID 15564882) the ligand 'E1S' is tagged as a polymorphism, similar in pattern to E216S which indicates a substitution at position 216 from glutamic acid to serine. Fortunately, the highlighted search results are easy to peruse, and irrelevant hits can quickly be discarded by users. The parsing of author names in the reference section of an article also leads to false positive gene polymorphisms, and the bibliographies should probably be removed from the corpus.</p><p>Some instances are missed by regular expressions that are too precise. For example, the gene name OCT-1 appears in the literature, whereas our lexicon contains the more standard notation OCT1 for this gene. Pharmspresso misses OCT-1 as a gene. Careful refinement of gene name templates could improve performance.</p><p>The creators of the Textpresso ontology often included the category name as a term in the category, such as the term 'cell' in the category 'cell or cell group'. This practice was useful to us, in particular with the inclusion of the word 'gene' in the {gene} category. Pharmspresso can thus highlight gene mentions, even if the gene itself does not appear in our lexicon; we can identify genes because the word 'gene' is highlighted. For example, in the sentence from PMID 12123487: 'the individual response to gemfibrozil could be partly explained by polymorphisms in genes coding for apolipoproteinB (apoB) and apoA1CIII', the drug gemfibrozil is reported to be in a relationship with the genes 'apolipoproteinB' and 'apoA1CIII', which do not appear in the Pharmspresso drug lexicon. However, because the word 'genes' does appear in the lexicon, this text snippet is highlighted, with the word 'genes' highlighted, and thus allows the researcher to examine the article in which the sentence appears. This also allows us to refine our gene lexicon to include the two genes mentioned. Similarly, if we expand the polymorphism category to identify the words 'polymorphism', 'variant', and 'allele', performance is likely to improve.</p><p>Our focus on the identification of polymorphism mentions in the literature, was in identifying those variants that can be mapped to specific locations in the genome. Thus, Pharmspresso does not recognize gene variant names that follow the "star notation" (such as 'CYP2A6*4') as a polymorphism, as they do not give any explicit genomic location information. However, Pharmspresso can easily be engineered to identify these variants, perhaps using a new category in the ontology. For example, in the 45 articles reviewed by the evaluators, there were 117 mentions of variants that follow the star notation. Pharmspresso uses a relatively simple algorithm for finding polymorphisms. Others have reported more complex methods &#x02013; sometimes more domain-specific and usually more computationally expensive for finding gene and variant mentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These may be incorporated in future versions of our system.</p><p>In our evaluation of polymorphism and gene detection, one of the 45 articles contained a large table with all the mentions of polymorphisms. However, as this table was an image embedded in the article, the conversion from PDF to text did not capture this information. This is a limitation of the system. For the purposes of this analysis, that article was removed and the analysis of polymorphism mentions included only 44 articles. We find that the most important polymorphisms are often also mentioned in the text of the article itself, and thus are not missed by Pharmspresso.</p><p>We note that there were some <italic>bona fide </italic>polymorphisms in the literature that the annotators missed &#x02013; these would have raised performance in identification of polymorphism mentions.</p><p>Pharmspresso identifies 74.4% of drug mentions when querying for the {drug} category, as opposed to only 50.3% if querying for {gene} and {drug} categories together. Often, the gene is described in once sentence, and the drug in the following sentence. Thus the strict limit of one sentence only might best be relaxed to allow 2 or more sentences. Pharmspresso does not currently have a mechanism to rank the most likely or most frequently mentioned associations. Such a ranking could assist users in deciding which associations are the most reliable.</p><p>A bottleneck in the process of the Pharmspresso pipeline is the gathering of the full-text articles. It can be tedious to download PDFs from journals that publish work on Pharmacogenomics. We anticipate that the improved availability of full text may permit partnerships with publishers to streamline the pipeline. Another limitation of the system is that Pharmspresso only works on a pre-defined corpus of relevant articles, and not on all existing literature. In the future, Pharmspresso will include a larger corpus, and abstracts will be used when the full text is not available. Additionally, the results of the information extraction will be downloadable in tabular format, useful for building interaction networks.</p><p>The Pharmspresso package is available to the public at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pharmspresso.stanford.edu"/>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pharmspresso is a resource that extracts information from full text articles by identifying key pharmacogenomic concepts and the relationships between them. It marks up a corpus of literature based on an ontology of concepts, among which are the classes genes, gene variants, drugs, and polymorphisms. Subsequently, it displays the sentence-level results to the user as visually enhanced text, highlighting the relevant extracted concepts within their local context. Pharmspresso is easily extendible to other disciplines. As the increasing amount of published literature makes it very difficult for humans to manage the knowledge in a scientific field, automated tools are needed to organize the information and effectively understand unstructured text. We are working on making Pharmspresso a robust system that will automatically retrieve relevant literature, mark it up using our ontology, extract the facts of interest, and use them to populate a database of interactions. In addition to serving as a resource for human users, the knowledge collected by Pharmspresso may also be amenable to automated data mining and relationship-discovery methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Pharmspresso ontology</title><p>We created the Pharmspresso ontology by adding to the existing Textpresso ontology the human gene, drug, polymorphism and disease categories.

A corpus of literature was downloaded from the web, totaling 1025 full text articles in PDF format. We used a free software package, xpdf <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf"/>, to convert PDF files to text; Perl scripts adapted from Textpresso were used to tokenize sentences and words. We implemented a tagging algorithm in Perl to tag text with the Pharmspresso ontology in XML format, and subsequently index the tagged text for use by the search engine.</p><p>CGI scripts access the database and create the HTML pages shown to the user. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows the Pharmspresso pipeline. In step 4 of the pipeline, each article is parsed for identification of all terms in the ontology that appear in the text. This process takes less than five minutes per 1000 full text articles on a single core consumer grade PC. Steps 2, 3 and 5 take a total of several minutes of computational time for the entire corpus.</p><p>We built a website for Pharmspresso, which allows search of the current corpus of literature, and is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pharmspresso.stanford.edu"/>.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmspresso corpus</title><p>The corpus of literature included in the current build of Pharmspresso (1025 downloaded full text PDFs) is papers currently in the PharmGKB, which have been manually verified as relevant to pharmacogenomics. We can also identify relevant literature by automatic extraction using a text classifier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], by receiving submissions from the user community, or via annotation by PharmGKB curators.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation</title><p>We evaluated Pharmspresso as follows: (1) We recruited gold standard evaluators (scientists familiar with pharmacogenetics literature), and sent each five articles (selected from the PharmGKB annotated corpus), with instructions to find within the full text of the article all mentions of genes, polymorphisms (with the associated gene name), and drugs. (2) Eleven evaluators reviewed a total of 45 articles. (3) We measured (i) the percent of gold-standard gene-mentions found by Pharmspresso when querying for sentences containing a term from the {gene} category, (ii) the percent of polymorphism mentions found by Pharmspresso when querying for sentences containing terms from both the {polymorphism} and {gene} categories, and (iii) the percent of drug mentions found by Pharmspresso when querying for sentences containing a term from the {drug} category.</p><p>When evaluating the performance of Pharmspresso in identification of polymorphism mentions, we compared to two versions of the gold standard: (i) the strict gold standard, which includes all mentions found by the evaluators, and (ii) a "no-table" gold standard, which removes from consideration those mentions annotated by the evaluators, that appeared only in a table embedded in the PDF as an image (and thus were not converted to text, thereby impossible for Pharmspresso to detect).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YG wrote the software, created the website, and analyzed the data.
