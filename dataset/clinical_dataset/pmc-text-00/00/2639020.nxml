After exposure to high summer temperatures, cool temperature triggers dormancy. The cessation of flowering and rosette formation by the cessation of elongation are characteristic of dormant plants, and can be stimulated by exogenous ethylene. Thus, the ethylene response pathway may be involved in temperature-induced dormancy of chrysanthemum. Transgenic chrysanthemums expressing a mutated ethylene receptor gene were used to assess this involvement. The transgenic lines showed reduced ethylene sensitivity: ethylene causes leaf yellowing in wild-type chrysanthemums, but leaves remained green in the transgenic lines. Extension growth and flowering of wild-type and transgenic lines varied between temperatures: at 20 &#x000b0;C, the transgenic lines showed the same stem elongation and flowering as the wild type; at cooler temperatures, the wild type formed rosettes with an inability to flower and entered dormancy, but some transgenic lines continued to elongate and flower. This supports the involvement of the ethylene response pathway in the temperature-induced dormancy of chrysanthemum. At the highest dosage of ethephon, an ethylene-releasing agent, wild-type plants formed rosettes with an inability to flower and became dormant, but one transgenic line did not. This confirms that dormancy is induced via the ethylene response pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chrysanthemum</kwd><kwd>dormancy</kwd><kwd>ethylene</kwd><kwd>flowering</kwd><kwd>rosette formation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chrysanthemums (<italic>Chrysanthemum morifolium</italic> Ramat.) are important ornamental plants around the world. Seasonal changes in extension growth and flowering of this short-day (SD) herbaceous perennial are an adaptation to a temperate climate in middle latitudes. Growth and flowering depend on the combination of growing temperature, daylength, and the environment of the previous season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Schwabe, 1950</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sumitomo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; T Hisamatsu, unpublished data). Temperature is significant, and the temperature of the previous season is an important factor in determining the capacity for growth and flowering in the subsequent season. Because long-term exposure to chilling in winter increases this capacity, plants with a high capacity show strong positive growth in spring and summer. Exposure to summer heat reduces this capacity. This decrease narrows the temperature range over which extension growth and flowering are possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Vegis, 1964</xref>), and chrysanthemum plants show slower extension growth and flowering in autumn than in spring at the same growing temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sumitomo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; T Hisamatsu, unpublished data). For example, at growing temperatures of 15/10 &#x000b0;C (light/dark), &#x02018;Sei-marine&#x02019; plants showed rapid extension and flowering in April (spring), but showed neither late in August (autumn) after exposure to high temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sumitomo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Plants exposed to summer heat form rosettes by a cessation of elongation, never flower, and become dormant under subsequent cool temperature (&#x0003c;15 &#x000b0;C) in late autumn. They continue leaf expansion in winter, although much more slowly. Thus, the dormant state in chrysanthemum plants is quantitative and can be considered a state of semi-dormancy, as in strawberry (<italic>Fragaria&#x000d7;ananassa</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">S&#x000f8;nsteby and Heide, 2006</xref>). The dormant plants have a large chilling requirement for the subsequent resumption of elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Schwabe, 1950</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Effects of ACC on flowering and internode length of chrysanthemum &#x02018;Sei-marine&#x02019;</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total ACC dose (&#x003bc;g plant<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of flowering plants (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Internode length<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">a</xref> (mm)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.5</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.1&#x000b1;0.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.4</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.8&#x000b1;0.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">500</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.1&#x000b1;0.1**</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>When plants were transferred to a growth chamber controlled at 20/15 &#x000b0;C (light/dark) with an 8 h photoperiod, 10 &#x003bc;l of ACC (0, 10, or 50 &#x003bc;g &#x003bc;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was applied to the shoot tips.

Rosette formation is the main adaptive response, maintaining the viability of meristems under winter cold, similar to the formation of terminal buds in woody perennials. In chrysanthemum, first high temperatures and then cool temperatures are significant environmental cues for the formation of rosettes before winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Schwabe, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sumitomo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; T Hisamatsu, unpublished data).</p><p>The physiological mechanisms involved in the development of dormancy in woody perennials have been investigated. In aspen trees (<italic>Populus tremula&#x000d7;tremuloides</italic>), a phytochrome gene is involved in photoperiodically induced dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Olsen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), and the <italic>CO/FT</italic> regulatory module controls the SD-induced growth cessation and formation of terminal buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">B&#x000f6;hlenius <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).

In addition, the gaseous plant hormone ethylene has been shown to play a role in the induction of bud dormancy in birch (<italic>Betula pendula</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ruonala <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Exogenous ethylene suppresses flower initiation and internode elongation in chrysanthemum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tjia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1969</xref>), as does 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid (ethephon), which is hydrolysed and releases to ethylene in plant tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Warner and Leopold, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kher <italic>et al.</italic>, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cockshull and Horridge, 1978</xref>).

In potato (<italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic>), ethylene has been shown to induce bud dormancy in microtubers, and the competitive ethylene antagonist 2,5-norbornadiene has been shown to promote microtuber sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Suttle, 1998</xref>). These results suggest that the ethylene response pathway may be involved in the dormancy of herbaceous perennials. However, the role of ethylene is poorly understood.</p><p>To investigate the involvement of the ethylene response pathway in temperature-induced rosette formation in chrysanthemum, the dormancy and growth of transgenic chrysanthemum plants with reduced sensitivity to ethylene under three temperature regimes were evaluated. The ethylene-low-sensitive plants elongated more than the wild type and did not form rosettes, and flowered under cooler temperatures. These findings suggest that the ethylene response pathway is involved in the induction of dormancy in chrysanthemum.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Effects of an ethylene precursor on growth and flowering</title><p>Flowering of chrysanthemum is inhibited by an exposure to light given during the night (night break).

Under cool temperatures, plants previously exposed to high temperatures form rosettes by ceasing extension growth, and failed to flower. This can be regarded as a kind of dormancy.</p><p>Exogenous ethylene and ethephon reduce internode elongation and inhibit flower induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tjia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kher <italic>et al.</italic>, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cockshull and Horridge, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Konishi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1985</xref>). Our results confirm these responses. The plants that received the highest dosage of ACC and ethephon formed rosettes with an inability to flower and entered dormancy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). This result suggests that ethylene is involved in the entry to dormancy. Therefore, the involvement of the ethylene response pathway in the temperature-induced dormancy of transgenic chrysanthemums with reduced ethylene sensitivity was investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Narumi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005<italic>b</italic></xref>). PCR analysis confirmed the expression of transgenes and the up-regulated expression of endogenous <italic>DG-ERS1</italic> mRNA in shoot tips of the transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). This increased <italic>DG-ERS1</italic> expression might increase the level of ethylene receptor proteins, and cause an additive reduction of ethylene sensitivity, since ethylene receptors negatively regulate the ethylene response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hua and Meyerowitz, 1998</xref>). The transgenic lines apparently showed reduced ethylene sensitivity compared with the wild type in the present conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) with the leaf yellowing assay established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doi <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref>. There was little variation in the leaf yellowing response among the selected transgenic lines, although the variation has been observed on primitive screening with the <italic>in vitro</italic> transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Narumi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005<italic>b</italic></xref>).</p><p>The wild-type plants showed reduced flowering and extension growth as the growing temperature dropped, and at 15 &#x000b0;C, they entered dormancy, forming rosettes with an inability to flower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Some transgenic lines showed greater extension growth and flowering than the wild type. This difference suggests that the ethylene response pathway is involved in the temperature-induced inhibition of extension growth and flowering. In contrast to the leaf yellowing response, the transgenic lines showed variation in the response of extension growth and flowering to temperature: <italic>No. 33</italic> showed no reduction in flowering and a smaller decrease in stem elongation than the other transgenic lines as the temperature dropped. Although Q-PCR analysis showed variation in the expression levels of transgenes and endogenous <italic>DG-ERS1</italic> mRNA in the transgenic lines, there was no quantitative correspondence to the suppression of dormancy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aida <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> reported that the levels of GUS activity did not quantitatively correspond to the expression levels of <italic>GUS</italic> mRNA, but depended on the translational efficiency of transgenes in a GUS assay of chrysanthemum transformants. Post-transcriptional regulation might alter the level of protein production of transgenes in this experiment. To confirm that dormancy is induced via the ethylene response pathway, the effect of exogenous ethylene in <italic>No. 33</italic>, which showed no entry to dormancy at 15 &#x000b0;C was investigated. <italic>No. 33</italic> showed reduced responses to ethephon, and did not enter dormancy even at the highest dosage, although ethephon induced dormancy in the wild type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). These results confirm that the ethylene response pathway is involved in dormancy of the chrysanthemum.</p><p>In herbaceous perennial chrysanthemums, low temperature controls both dormancy induction (in autumn) and its release (in winter), as reported for the woody Rosaceae family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Heide and Prestrud, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Heide, 2008</xref>). Thus, our results strongly suggest that the ethylene response pathway is at least involved in dormancy induction in chrysanthemum, as reported in potato microtuber dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Suttle, 1998</xref>) and in birch bud dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ruonala <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). So far, there is no evidence for its involvement in the dormancy release processes during low temperature in chrysanthemum.</p><p>Flower bud initiation on the main stem is induced by shortening of the photoperiod under cooling temperatures (18&#x02212;23 &#x000b0;C) in late summer. The main stem flowers, fruits, and then dies before winter. Suckers emerge from its base in response to the disappearance of its apical dominance in mid to late autumn. These suckers soon enter dormancy and form rosettes with an inability to flower, even under SD floral-inducing conditions, in response to cool temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Here, there were differences between extension growth and flowering responses to decreasing growing temperature. Although the reduction of extension growth in <italic>Nos 10</italic>, <italic>19</italic>, <italic>27</italic>, and <italic>45</italic> was similar to that in the wild type, the inhibition of flowering as temperature dropped was smaller than in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A, B</xref>). Moreover, <italic>No. 33</italic> showed no inhibition of flowering, even though extension growth decreased as temperature dropped. These results suggest that the reduced ethylene sensitivity was responsible more for the inhibition of the temperature-induced reduction of flowering than for the inhibition of elongation under lower temperatures. In birch, SD triggers the cessation of elongation growth and the formation of terminal buds. In ethylene-insensitive transgenic birches, the formation of terminal buds was inhibited, but elongation was still reduced under SD, suggesting that ethylene facilitates the SD-induced terminal bud formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ruonala <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Our results suggest that the ethylene response pathway facilitates the temperature-induced inhibition of flowering in apical buds, not the reduction of stem elongation, associated with dormancy of chrysanthemums. The dormant buds are thus saved from flowering. This is very important behaviour to allow chrysanthemums to survive during winter. If flowering were induced in all buds on suckers in late autumn, the following cold would seriously damage them, and the plants could not resume growth the next year. Our results suggest that the ethylene response pathway plays a role in saving buds by inhibiting floral induction under cool SD conditions. Ethylene might therefore play an important role as a gaseous signal molecule in characterizing a perennial's growth behaviour (the annual cycling between growth and dormancy) that permits survival in winter.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>The seasonal calendar of chrysanthemum.
