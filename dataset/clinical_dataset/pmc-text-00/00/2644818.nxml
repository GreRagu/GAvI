However, the extent to which such differences control virulence in natural isolates of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, including those from more diverse genetic backgrounds, is uncertain. We elucidated the evolutionary history and functional consequences of diversification in the serine/threonine kinase ROP18, a major virulence determinant in the mouse model. We characterized the extent of sequence polymorphism and the evolutionary forces acting on <italic>ROP18</italic> and several antigen-encoding genes within a large collection of natural isolates, comparing them to housekeeping genes and introns. Surprisingly, despite substantial genetic diversity between lineages, we identified just three principal alleles of <italic>ROP18</italic>, which had very ancient ancestry compared to other sampled loci. Expression and allelic differences between these three alleles of <italic>ROP18</italic> accounted for much of the variation in acute mouse virulence among natural isolates. While the avirulent type III allele was the most ancient, intermediate virulent (type II) and highly virulent (type I) lineages predominated and showed evidence of strong selective pressure. Out-group comparison indicated that historical loss of an upstream regulatory element increased <italic>ROP18</italic> expression, exposing it to newfound diversifying selection, resulting in greatly enhanced virulence in the mouse model and expansion of new lineages. Population sweeps are evident in many genomes, yet their causes and evolutionary histories are rarely known. Our results establish that up-regulation of expression and selection at <italic>ROP18</italic> in <italic>T. gondii</italic> has resulted in three distinct alleles with widely different levels of acute virulence in the mouse model. Preservation of all three alleles in the wild indicates they are likely adaptations for different niches. Our findings demonstrate that sweeping changes in population structure can result from alterations in a single gene.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The determinants of virulence are rarely defined for eukaryotic parasites such as <italic>T. gondii</italic>, a widespread parasite of mammals that also infects humans, sometimes with serious consequences. Recent laboratory studies have established that variation in a single secreted protein, a serine/threonine kinase known as ROPO18, controls whether or not mice survive infection. Here, we establish the extent and nature of variation in <italic>ROP18</italic> among a collection of parasite strains from geographically diverse regions. Compared to other genes, <italic>ROP18</italic> showed extremely high levels of diversification and changes in expression level, which correlated with severity of infection in mice. Comparison with an out-group demonstrated that changes in the upstream region that regulates expression of <italic>ROP18</italic> led to an historical increase in the expression and exposed the protein to diversifying selective pressure. Surprisingly, only three atypically distinct protein variants exist despite marked genetic divergence elsewhere in the genome. These three forms of <italic>ROP18</italic> are likely adaptations for different niches in nature, and they confer markedly different virulence to mice. The widespread distribution of a single mouse-virulent allele among geographically and genetically disparate parasites may have consequences for transmission and disease in other hosts, including humans.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> provides a valuable model for studying the evolution of pathogens because it is widespread and infects virtually all warm-blooded vertebrates, including companion and agricultural animals.

Despite the presence of a sexual cycle, which occurs only in cats, the population structure can be remarkably clonal, with just three highly similar lineages predominating in North America and Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Howe1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Ajzenberg1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. These lineages were previously referred to as types I, II, and III (or groups 1, 2, and 3) and are referred to here as &#x0201c;the clonal lineages&#x0201d;. Estimates of the common ancestry of these clonal lineages indicates that a dramatic genetic sweep lead to the successful expansion of these lineages during the past &#x0223c;10,000 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Su1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, distinct strains from South America are more genetically variable, reflecting both asexual and sexual propagation. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses indicate that northern and southern strains diversified during geographic separation over the past several million years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Lehmann1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Khan1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The three clonal lineages in the North share a monomorphic version of chromosome Ia, which appears to have arisen coincident with their origin, and which has more recently penetrated into the South <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Khan1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Khan2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Comparison of interstrain polymorphisms suggests the clonal lineages originated from only a few genetic crosses between highly related parents (1&#x02013;2&#x00025; divergence), engendering an unusual pattern of biallelism at most loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Boyle1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Within these otherwise highly homogeneous genomes, a small number of polymorphic genes encode variable surface antigens (SAGs) and antigenic proteins secreted from rhoptries (ROP) or dense granules (GRA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Kong1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Jacobs1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite their genetic similarities, the northern clonal lineages differ markedly in their virulence to outbred laboratory mice: type I strains are acutely virulent with an estimated 100&#x00025; lethal dose (LD<sub>100</sub>) of a single organism, while types II and III are relatively nonvirulent (LD<sub>50</sub>&#x0003e;10<sup>5</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Sibley1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Mice are a natural host for <italic>T. gondii</italic>, and the laboratory mouse provides an excellent model for establishing differences in pathogenesis between parasite strains. Type I strain show faster rates of replications in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Radke1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, enhanced migration <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Barragan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, and reach higher tissue burdens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Mordue1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> in laboratory mice. While acute mortality exhibited in mice may not be directly extrapolated to other hosts, such experimental models can identify candidate factors that may influence the outcome of infection in other hosts, potentially affecting transmission and disease.</p><p>Various factors are likely to influence the outcome of human infection, including the genotype of the parasite. However, because human-to-human transmission plays little role in the evolution of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, any contribution of parasite genotype to pathogenesis is an indirect consequence of adaptation in other hosts. The vast majority of human cases of toxoplasmosis that have been described in North America and Europe belong to the type II genotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Ajzenberg1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Howe2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Type II strains often cause mild infection in healthy individuals, and yet can very severe congenital infection and acute severe toxoplasmic encephalitis in AIDS patients. While relatively uncommon in the wild, type I strains have been associated with several small cohorts of human congenital toxoplasmosis and opportunistic infection in AIDS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Fuentes1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Khan3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting type I strains may be more likely to cause disease in permissive hosts. In other regions of the world, genetically more diverse strains have been associated with severe infection. For example, atypical genotypes of <italic>T. gondii</italic> predominate in French Guyana where severe infections have been described in otherwise healthy adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Dard2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Carme1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Divergent genotypes of <italic>T. gondii</italic> have also been associated with severe ocular toxoplasmosis in southern Brazil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Khan4">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and in the United States <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Grigg1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, strains from both of these South American regions are acutely virulent in the mouse model, similar to the type I lineage.</p><p>The marked phenotypic differences expressed in the murine model have been utilized to explore the contribution of parasite genotype to pathogenesis. Excellent forward and reverse genetic systems have recently supported genome-wide analyses of the factors that control phenotypic differences between the clonal lineages. Independent screens have converged on secretory proteins, discharged from apical organelles called rhoptries, as key modulators of both host gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Saeij1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and of acute virulence in the mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Saeij2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Taylor1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. During host cell invasion, the parasite discharges the contents of rhoptries into the host cell, thereby delivering a variety of kinases, phosphatases, and other potential effectors directly into the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Boothroyd1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Bradley1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Genetic mapping studies have shown that the primary determinant of acute mouse virulence in type I strains of <italic>T. gondii</italic> is a polymorphic rhoptry kinase known as ROP18, which relies on serine/threonine (S/T) kinase activity to promote growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-ElHajj1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, and enhance virulence in the mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Taylor1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>ROP18</italic> and other polymorphic ROPs have been implicated in the more subtle differences in pathogenicity that occur between types II and III strains in the mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Saeij1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Saeij2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite these advances, the phenotypic consequences of variation in <italic>ROP18</italic> in genetically diverse, natural isolates of <italic>T. gondii</italic> remain uncertain. Here, we examined the contribution of genetic variation at ROP18 to the natural variation in mouse virulence and the population structure of <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>ROP18</italic> Is among the Most Divergent Genes in <italic>T. gondii</italic></title><p>The clonal lineages of <italic>T. gondii</italic> are 98&#x00025; identical at most loci, reflecting the close similarity of parental lineages that gave rise to them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Boyle1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Hence, we undertook a similar reverse genetic analysis with the newly identified subtypes of <italic>ROP18I&#x0002a;</italic> in order to determine if they were also capable of conferring acute virulence or if they had lost this trait due to mutation. We chose three representative isolates for this analysis from different branches of the ROP18I&#x0002a; tree that have not been previously analyzed; including RUB (<italic>ROP18I&#x0002a;b</italic>), MAS (<italic>ROP18I&#x0002a;c</italic>) and CAST.

To examine the contribution of <italic>ROP18</italic> expression to the variation in virulence among natural isolates, we examined the surrounding genomic regions and tested expression by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Substantial differences in the upstream regions of <italic>ROP18</italic> were evident when the three clonal lineages were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000404-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Direct DNA sequencing revealed that Types I and II were highly similar, aside from the tandem duplication of three copies of a 44 bp block in type II, while this region only occurs once in type I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000404-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, the type III lineage contains a &#x0223c;2 kb segment of DNA upstream of the <italic>ROP18</italic> gene that was not present in types I or II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000404-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). There is no similarity of this upstream segment (UPS) to other regions of the genome nor is there any homologous sequence in NCBI (data not shown). Using specific PCR primers that distinguished the upstream region of types I and II (primers A/B) from type III (primers C/D), we demonstrated that they amplified mutually exclusive fragments from genomic DNAs derived from a set of representative clonal isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000404-g005">Figure 5B,C</xref>). This analysis confirmed that the UPS is unique to the type III lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000404-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Further analysis of a wider collection of strains from other haplogroups identified the UPS only in members of type III (group 3), group 9, and a single member of group 4 (i.e. CASTELLS). All other strains lacked the UPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000404-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Sequencing the coding regions of <italic>ROP18 III&#x0002a;</italic> alleles confirmed that these were always flanked by the UPS, which was invariably lacking in <italic>ROP18 I&#x0002a;</italic> and <italic>ROP18II&#x0002a;</italic> alleles (data not shown).</p><fig id="pgen-1000404-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000404.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Expression levels of <italic>ROP18</italic> correlate with acute virulence.</title><p>A) Schematic of <italic>ROP18</italic> coding and upstream regions based on sequence analysis of the three clonal lineages.

Strains containing the UPS expressed low levels of <italic>ROP18</italic> and were nonvirulent in outbred mice, whereas the opposite was true of parasites lacking the UPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000404-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In total, 17/18 type I&#x0002a; strains were acutely virulent while 6 of 8 type III&#x0002a; were avirulent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000404.s003">Table S2</xref>). Rare exceptions to this pattern (i.e. BOF for type I&#x0002a;; P89 and CASTELLS for type III&#x0002a;) were not due to differences in either the coding or the upstream regions of <italic>ROP18</italic> (sequencing data not shown), and presumably arise from other genetic differences. For example, BOF contains a type I&#x0002a; allele, lacks the UPS, and shows high expression of <italic>ROP18</italic>, yet is avirulent in the mouse model, presumably due to a defect in some other pathway needed for efficient infection. Importantly, this strain was isolated from an AIDS patient, suggesting it may only be pathogenic in immunocompromised hosts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000404.s003">Table S2</xref>). Conversely, P89 and CASTELLS contain a type III allele and the corresponding UPS, consistent with their low expression of <italic>ROP18</italic>, yet they both show high levels of virulence. Presumably this is the result of another favorable combination of genes that enhance pathogenicity, as these strains are not conventional members of the type III clonal lineage, but rather divergent isolates. Importantly, the variation in expression level among type I or type III strains differed by more than an order of magnitude, without altering their respective phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000404-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Whereas virulence in <italic>ROP18I&#x0002a;</italic> and <italic>ROP18III&#x0002a;</italic> expressing strains tended to be all or none, virulence among <italic>ROP18II&#x0002a;</italic> expressing strains increased with the expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000404-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Among strains expressing type II&#x0002a; alleles, expression level and mortality were highly correlated (r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.68) as shown by linear regression analysis (line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000404-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Consistent with this, previous reports indicate that over-expression of the type II allele in the type III background leads to a dramatic increase in virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Saeij2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The low level of expression of ROP18III&#x0002a; may be finely tuned to the genotype as a whole, since it has thus far not been possible to over-express the type III allele or to disrupt <italic>ROP18</italic> by homologous recombination (data not shown). Overall, the combination of allele and expression level of <italic>ROP18</italic> correlates with acute virulence in 30 of 33 strains included here. Hence, differences in acute virulence among these isolates can be largely explained by the allele of <italic>ROP18</italic> and the extent of its expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>DNA Rearrangements Were Associated with Upregulation of <italic>ROP18</italic> Expression</title><p>The striking increase in <italic>ROP18</italic> expression in the absence of the UPS, previously established for laboratory strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Boyle2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, also characterizes our broader sample of natural isolates.

The resulting DNA deletion or rearrangement lead to upregulation of <italic>ROP18</italic> expression in <italic>ROP18I&#x0002a;</italic> and <italic>ROP18II&#x0002a;</italic> alleles. Subsequent expansion of these alleles substantially shaped the population structure of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. The highly virulent <italic>ROP18I&#x0002a;</italic> allele predominates among known haplogroups, especially those in South America, whereas the type II&#x0002a; allele (conferring intermediate virulence) typifies most human and animal infections in North America and Europe. Each of the three highly divergent alleles of ROP18, conferring markedly different virulence levels in laboratory mice, have been maintained over long periods of time, suggesting that they confer selective advantages in particular environmental circumstances.</p><p>Strains harboring ROP18I&#x0002a; have clearly enjoyed recent evolutionary success, as they characterize 8 of 11 haplogroups studied here, including a number of recently derived subgroups that appear to be expanding. However, it is doubtful that the acute virulence as expressed in the laboratory mouse model would be adaptive in natural hosts. Laboratory mice, while a convenient model, are likely more susceptible than many species that are natural hosts of <italic>T. gondii</italic>. For example, other rodents (<italic>Peromyscus</italic> spp., <italic>Rattus</italic> spp.) survive infections with type I strains of <italic>T. gondii</italic> and develop chronic infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Dubey3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Frenkel1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, promoting eventual transmission to other hosts. Thus, a reasonable hypothesis is that while ROP18I&#x0002a; leads to mortality in especially vulnerable hosts, such as the laboratory mouse, it instead facilitates the establishment of infection in resistant hosts, thus enhancing transmission. By contrast, type II strains are intermediate in virulence in laboratory mice, express a proclivity for developing into tissue cysts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Weiss1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, and modulate host immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Saeij1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Robson1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Robben1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Collectively, such adaptations may promote the establishment of chronic infection (although this genotype has also been associated with immunopathology in several models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Liesenfeld1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>). Clearly enhanced pathogenicity is not always advantageous to parasite fitness. Adaptation to an alternative niche may explain the long-term persistence of lineages expressing <italic>ROP18III&#x0002a;</italic>. While the <italic>ROP18III&#x0002a;</italic> allele is expressed at very low levels, it is not a pseudogene and despite its very high divergence, it preserves all of the essential residues in the S/T kinase domain necessary for activity (data not shown). This suggests that low levels of expression may be an adaptation for infection in some particular hosts, potentially those that are highly susceptible to infection. Defining the precise advantages of each of these alleles will require further studies of the transmission between natural hosts and a better understanding of the population genetic structure in the wild.</p><p>Mathematical modeling studies predict that pathogens may evolve greater virulence provided that doing so does not reduce their potential for transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000404-Frank1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

Typically the underlying molecular mechanisms for such adaptations are not known.

Understating pathogenic determinants of <italic>T. gondii</italic> in model systems, will facilitate future studies to more precisely evaluate the contribution of parasite genotype and specific genes, to transmission in natural hosts and potentially for human disease.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Comparison of <italic>T. gondii</italic> Gene Diversity</title><p>Sequences of 32 loci from representative genomes of clonal lineages type I, II and III, were downloaded from the <italic>T. gondii</italic> genome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.toxodb.org">www.toxodb.org</ext-link>).
