Using Southern blot analysis, we further demonstrated that the viral RNAs were predominantly packaged in CsCl purified mature capsids (containing viral genome) than empty/intermediate capsids. Some of the packaged viral RNAs appear to be polyadenylated. Real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis indicated that the copy number of the tested viral mRNAs encoding E1B<sub>small </sub>and fiber proteins was less than one per full capsid. Moreover, detection of viral RNA packaged in CsCl purified human adenovirus (HAdV) -5 virions indicates that the viral RNA packaging might be a common phenomenon in members of <italic>Adenoviridae </italic>family. Further quantitative analysis of viral protein, DNA, and RNA in CsCl purified mature and empty/intermediate capsids of recombinant HAdV-5 expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein indicated that the traceable viral RNA detected in empty/intermediate capsids seems associated with the presence of traceable viral genomic DNA. Taken together, our data suggest that the viral RNAs may be passively packaged in adenovirus virion during encapsidation of viral genomic DNA in cell nuclei. Thus, viral RNA packaging may be a characteristic feature of adenoviral genomic DNA encapsidation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The phenomenon of encapsidation of viral RNAs was initially uncovered in members of <italic>Herpesviridae </italic>family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These RNAs could be translated into proteins that would function prior to <italic>de novo </italic>transcription from the viral genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Alternatively, these viral RNAs might facilitate organizing the structure of the tegument domain through RNA-protein interactions during virion assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] as found in retroviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, the studies with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) suggested that both the viral and the cellular RNAs were nonspecifically incorporated into the virions through interactions with some virion proteins during budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, studies with herpes simplex virus (HSV) -1 and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) suggested that some virion RNAs were specifically incorporated into the virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Adenoviruses are another family of DNA viruses that infect a wide variety of mammals and birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Adenovirus is non-enveloped containing a single, linear double-stranded DNA of approximately 26&#x02013;43 kb within an icosahedral capsid of 70&#x02013;100 nanometer in diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The assembly of mature adenovirus virion leads to the formation of intermediate capsids, some of which may contain little viral or cellular DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Earlier, we demonstrated that viral RNAs were packaged in porcine adenovirus (PAdV) -3 virions, a non-enveloped DNA virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Another report suggested that a non-viral RNA (LacZ mRNA) transcribed from a recombinant human adenovirus (HAdV) -5 is packaged into the HAdV-5 virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In this report, we examined the incorporation of viral RNAs in mature and empty/intermediate capsids of PAdV-3 and HAdV-5. Moreover, the characteristics of packaged viral RNAs were further examined by Southern blot hybridization and real-time RT-PCR analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and Viruses</title><p>VIDO R1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS).

The cell lysates were subjected to a step gradient with 1.2 and 1.4 g of CsCl/ml and ultracentrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 2 h. Two major bands were harvested and loaded on a continuous CsCl gradient at 1.32 g/ml and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm overnight. The bands from this gradient were further purified on a third gradient and then dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Similarly, HAdV-5 capsids were purified from 293 cells infected with wt HAdV-5 or recombinant HAV5.EGFP.

TaqMan probes for E1B<sub>small </sub>(5'-TTTATC AAGGTAGTAGCAG AGGCCA-3') and fiber (5'-TCCCTGGGTCCCGGTCT TTCTA ACT-3') were labeled with FAM at 5'-end and TAMRA at 3'-end, and purchased from Qiagen.

As a negative control, RNase-treated RNA samples were also reversely transcribed and simultaneously subjected to PCR reaction. Serial 10-fold dilutions of known amount of plasmid pFPAV3 DNA (known as pPAV200)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] containing E1B<sub>small </sub>and fiber genes were used as positive control to generate the standard curve. The copy numbers were calculated by converting the weight unit of double-stranded pFPAV3 DNA into the numbers of single-stranded DNA molecules. The averaged cycle threshold (Ct) values of five replicates were used to determine the relative RNA copy number.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Preparation and characterization of PAdV-3 capsids</title><p>At late times during adenovirus infection, two kinds of particles are abundant, which can be separated by CsCl gradient centrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The heavy particles exhibiting a density of approximately 1.32 g/ml are the mature capsids that are composed of the capsid proteins, the core proteins and the viral DNA. The lighter particles exhibiting a density of approximately 1.29 g/ml are the empty/intermediate capsids that are composed of the capsid proteins, but are usually devoid of the genomic DNA and the core proteins. In order to obtain different capsids, we chose to purify mutant Pav3-PL1, (reduced DNA packaging efficiency) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and wt PAdV-3. As seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, two major bands and a minor band were observed in wt PAdV-3 or in mutant Pav-3-PL1 infected cell lysate after CsCl gradient centrifugation. As expected, the upper band was heavier than the lower band in Pav-3-PL1 infected cells. The yields of both empty/intermediate and mature capsids were quantified by measuring protein concentration with Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Production of the virus capsids</bold>.

Ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel showed that the viral genomic DNA is present predominantly in the lower bands (data not shown), confirming that the viral particles with the density of 1.32 g/ml are the mature capsids. To determine the integrity of the capsids, transmission electron microscopy was performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Analysis of the preparations by the electron microscope (EM) suggested that the mature and the empty/intermediate capsids of both wt PAdV-3 and mutant Pav3-PL1 are predominantly intact (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, wild-type PAdV-3).</p></sec><sec><title>Viral RNA was mainly detected in mature capsids and appeared polyadenylated</title><p>Earlier studies demonstrated that most of the viral RNAs were nonspecifically packaged in HCMV and KSHV particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We reasoned that if the viral RNAs were nonspecifically incorporated into PAdV-3 particles as well, the empty/intermediate capsids would be expected to contain more viral RNAs than the full capsids, since the absence of viral genome in the empty/intermediate capsids would leave extra room for RNAs. To test this hypothesis, equal amounts (based on protein concentrations) of CsCl purified empty/intermediate and mature capsids of wt PAdV-3 were treated with RNase to remove RNAs contaminated outside of viral particles before processing for the isolation of virion RNAs as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The isolated virion RNAs were treated with RNase-free DNase (Ambion) to eliminate the contaminated viral genomic DNA, followed by addition of 0.1 volume DNase inactivation reagent (DNA-free kit, Ambion). The RNA was also isolated from wt PAdV-3 infected cells as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Two micrograms of virion RNAs from each preparation were converted into [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled cDNAs by reverse transcriptase II (Invitrogen) with oligo-dT and hexamers in the presence of [<sup>32</sup>P]-dCTP as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. As a control, two microgram of virion RNAs from each preparation were treated with RNase before RT reaction. The resultant cDNAs were subsequently hybridized to the membrane blots containing <italic>Hind</italic>III-digested wt PAdV-3 genomic DNA. Positive signals were detected with radioactive probes made from the RNAs isolated from wt PAdV-3 infected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel a). Similarly, positive signals were also detected with radioactive probes made from the virion RNA isolated from the mature capsids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel d). No signal could be detected with radioactive probes made from the RNase treated RNAs isolated from PAdV-3 infected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel a) or purified mature capsids (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel d) indicating that the positive signals were detected due to labeled probes generated from the viral RNAs. These results confirmed our earlier observation that the viral RNAs are packaged in the mature capsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Compared with mature capsids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel d), a weak signal was detected with radioactive probes made from the RNAs isolated from the empty/intermediate capsids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel e), suggesting that empty/intermediate capsids might contain only trace amounts of viral RNAs. The trace virion RNAs detected in the empty/intermediate capsids might be the RNAs packaged nonspecifically in empty/intermediate capsids. Taken together, the results indicated that the viral RNAs were mainly packaged in the mature capsids containing viral genomic DNAs.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Southern hybridization with PAdV-3 DNA</bold>.

As a positive control, 2 &#x003bc;g of total RNA isolated from wt PAdV-3-infected VIDO R1 cells at late times post infection was reversely transcribed in the presence of [<sup>32</sup>P]-dCTP as described above. As a negative control, 2 &#x003bc;g of total RNA from swine testis (ST) cells was reversely transcribed in the presence of [<sup>32</sup>P]-dCTP. As expected, radiolabeled probes made from the RNAs isolated from uninfected ST cells did not produce any positive signals in Southern blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel c). In contrast, radiolabeled probes made from RNAs isolated from wt PAdV-3-infected VIDO R1 cells resulted in strong signals, indicating that PAdV-3 specific RNAs were present in cellular RNA preparations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel b). No signal could be detected with radiolabeled probes made from the RNase treated RNA isolated from wt PAdV-3-infected VIDO R1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel b). Compared with the oligo-dT and hexamer-doubly primed RT reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel a), the oligo-dT primed RT reaction displayed weaker positive signals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panel b).

Mature (Ma); Empty/Intermediate (E-I).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-422X-6-16-5"/></fig><p>Since both mature and empty/intermediate capsids may contain viral/cellular DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], initially we quantitated the viral DNA in these capsids. Equal amounts (based on protein concentrations) of CsCl purified capsids were treated with RNase A and DNaseI as described above. The samples were further treated with 100 &#x003bc;g/ml proteinase K (Invitrogen) at 50&#x000b0;C for 2 h, before extracting sequentially with phenol and chloroform. The DNA was precipitated by isopropanol and dissolved in RNase A containing TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH8.0). Quantitative analysis suggested that mature capsids yielded 100 times more DNA than empty/intermediate capsids irrespective of the RNase/DNase treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The significant difference in the amount of DNA obtained from mature and empty/intermediate capsids is consistent with the general suggestion that mature capsid contains mature viral genomic DNA and empty/intermediate capsid may contain little premature viral DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, DNA in mature and empty/intermediate capsids is not accessible to DNase/RNase treatment of the intact capsids. To confirm this further, we examined the expression of EGFP in 293 cells infected with equal amounts of mature or empty/intermediate capsid samples with or without RNase/DNase treatment. As seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, EGFP expression was detected in cells infected with mature or empty/intermediate capsids. However, empty/intermediate capsids transduced 10<sup>4 </sup>fold less cells than the mature capsids. These results suggested that empty/intermediate capsids may contain premature viral and/or cellular DNA. Earlier reports have suggested that some of the intermediate capsids may contain left end of the adenovirus genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Next, we quantified the RNAs present in the capsids. RNA was extracted from equal amounts (based on protein concentrations) of CsCl purified HAV5. EGFP mature and empty/intermediate capsids as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Equal amount (42 &#x003bc;g) of total RNAs were isolated from both mature and empty/intermediate capsids without RNase/DNase treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). However, RNase/DNase treatment reduced the total RNA yields (only 2 &#x003bc;g) of both mature or empty/intermediate capsids by 21 fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). These results indicated that a large amount of RNAs bound to the capsid surface could not be removed by CsCl ultracentrifugation. To analyze the amount of viral RNAs present in the total RNAs isolated from mature and empty/intermediate capsids, 2 &#x003bc;g of RNA isolated from mature or empty/intermediate capsids without RNase/DNase treatment was reversely transcribed by reverse transcriptase II (Invitrogen) in the presence of [<sup>32</sup>P]-dCTP. Synthesized [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled cDNAs were hybridized to <italic>Hind</italic>III-digested plasmid pFHAV5 containing E1A-deleted HAdV-5 genome. As expected, the cDNA probes resulted in positive signals as strong as the cDNA probes made from wt HAdV-5 infected 293 cell RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). This is consistent with the suggestion that CsCl purification does not remove the RNAs bound to capsid surfaces.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of RNA in HAV5.EGFP capsids with or without RNase/DNase treatment</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Total yields of RNAs isolated from mature and empty/intermediate capsids with or without RNase/DNase treatment. <bold>(B) </bold>The [<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled cDNAs were made by reverse transcription of 2 &#x003bc;g, RNase-free DNase treated RNAs from mature and empty/intermediate capsids with or without RNase/DNase treatment and hybridized to <italic>Hind</italic>III-digested pFHAV5, which contains E1A-deleted HAdV-5 genome.

As seen in (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), these cDNA probes also resulted in positive signals, confirming that there are viral RNAs present inside the capsids. Although the total RNA yields from mature and empty/intermediate cpasids with RNase/DNase treatment appeared similar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), the quantitative analysis indicated that the mature capsids contain more (30 fold) viral RNAs than empty/intermediate capsids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). It is possible that the empty/intermediate capsids contain more cellular RNA. However, absence of detection of cellular mRNAs of house-keeping genes such as actin in virion RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] raises the possibility that the majority of the cellular RNAs isolated from mature and empty capsids might be rRNAs.</p><p>Although the virion RNAs were detected in the mature capsids, the low copy number of examined RNAs suggests that the viral RNAs might be packaged in a passive way by accompanying the viral genomic DNA at the stage of DNA encapsidation. So far, two models for adenovirus assembly have been proposed on the basis of pulse-chase analysis and the study of mutant viruses. The traditional model is that the adenovirus assembly begins with the formation of empty capsids, followed by the insertion of viral DNA into preformed empty capsids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, recently proposed model suggests that the capsids are assembled around the viral genomic DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The insertion of viral genome into the preformed empty capsids more likely would separate the synthesized RNAs from viral genome, resulting in missing of the viral RNAs in full capsids containing the viral genome. Thus, a mechanism of adenovirus assembly where packaging of virion RNAs with genomic DNA is coordinated with capsid formation appears to be plausible.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LX designed and carried out the experiments, and helped to analyze the data and draft the manuscript.
