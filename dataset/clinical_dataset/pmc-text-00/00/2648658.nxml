Introduction</title><p>Zoonotic tick-borne  diseases in Europe have  become increasingly prominent  since the emergence of Lyme borreliosis (LB)in the early 1980s, and the incidence of this disease and that of tick-borneencephalitis (TBE) have risen dramatically over the last two decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Bothdiseases are transmitted by hard ticks of the <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> species complex (<italic>I. ricinus</italic> and <italic>I. persulcatus)</italic> and since these ticks spend most of their time in theenvironment, climate change is likely to affect their distribution andabundance and, therefore, the incidence of disease. <italic>I. ricinus</italic> and <italic>I. persulcatus</italic> are particularly sensitive toenvironmental conditions since in their prolonged nonparasitic phases theyrequire a microclimatic relative humidity of at least 80% to avoid fataldesiccation. They are, therefore, restricted to areas of moderate-to-highrainfall where there is a good cover of vegetation, so that the soil surface remains humid through the driest times ofthe year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] reported that in northern temperate Europe temperature increases of  1.5&#x02013;2.5&#x000b0;C may occurover the next few decades as a result of global warming. Such climate changemay extend or curtail host-seeking tick activity periods, potentiallyincreasing or decreasing tick abundance and distribution, and effects on tickdevelopment rates can change seasonal activity patterns by altering theproportion of the tick population that are exposed to regulatory mechanisms suchas diapause. In areas where lowered summer precipitation coincides with raisedsummer temperatures, the survival, activity, and distribution of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> and <italic>I. </italic><italic>persulcatus</italic> are likely to be reduced because of theirvulnerability to desiccation. These tick species acquire their hosts by ambushing them from the vegetation and asignificant number of large animals, such as deer, must be present in thehabitat in order to feed the adult females and thus maintain the tickpopulations. The more catholic host preferences of the immature tick stages(larvae and nymphs), which parasitize reptiles, small and medium-sized mammalsand birds, in addition to large mammals, contribute significantly to thecirculation of diverse pathogens between the tick and host populations. Climatechange may, therefore, exert a major influence on both tick abundance anddisease prevalence by affecting faunal diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Other important European tick species such as <italic>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</italic> and <italic>Dermacentor reticulatus</italic> can be affectedby climate change through similar mechanisms, but anthropogenic factors alsohave profound effects on disease incidence, and separating these from theinfluence of climate change represents a major challenge. In this reviewattention is mainly focused on evidence for the effects of climate change onthe distribution and abundance of European ticks. The potential impacts ofclimate-change effects on the incidences of the diseases they transmit arediscussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. Effects of Climate Change on TickDistribution and Abundance</title><sec id="subsec2.1"><title>2.1. Ixodes ricinus</title><p>Theclimate is regarded as the principal restricting factor at the northern limitof <italic>I. ricinus</italic> distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although <italic>I. ricinus</italic> is surprisingly cold-hardyand when winter-acclimatized can survive 24-hour exposure to temperaturesranging from  &#x02212;14.4&#x000b0;C to  &#x02212;18.9&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], thedetrimental effects of cold are accumulative and exposure for 30 days to only  &#x02212;10&#x000b0;C has beenshown to be lethal for a high proportion of unfed nymphs and diapausingengorged larvae and nymphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Molting <italic>I. ricinus</italic> ticks are even more vulnerable so that if summer temperatures arenot high enough to completedevelopment before the onset of winter (little or no development takes placebetween 7  and 10&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]), they are unlikely to survive even moderate frosts. Degree-day models have beendeveloped which proved useful in elucidating the <italic>I. ricinus</italic> life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], but more research on the winter biologyof this species would help further understand its northern distribution limit.</p><p>In Sweden, the northern distribution limit of <italic>I. ricinus</italic>, together with that of several other animal and plant species, hasshifted northwards since the climate started to noticeably change in the late1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The geographical distribution range of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> used to be located below 61&#x000b0;N [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], but ticks are nowestablished along the whole Baltic Sea coastline (up to 66&#x000b0;N) and along the river valleys and the larger lakes in thenorthern regions. This shift in latitude distribution has been shown to berelated to changes over several seasons in the number of degree-days withtemperatures vital for tick survival, activity and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. At thehighest latitudes fewer days with cold winter temperatures (well below &#x02212;12&#x000b0;C for longerperiods) had the clearest impact for new tick establishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In central Sweden (59&#x000b0;N to 61&#x000b0;N) in areaswith medium-high densities of ticks, increases in tick abundance werecorrelated to a combination of mild winters (fewer days with temperatures below7&#x000b0;C) and extended spring and autumn seasons (more days with minimumtemperatures not lower than 5 to 8&#x000b0;C). In south and central Sweden, the current climate only allows a tickactivity season of 6&#x02013;8 months comparedto as much as 11 months in some parts of the British Isles, and further changesin seasonal climate in Sweden  are likely to continue to have a major impact on the prevalence of ticks. Thecombination of climate variables affecting ticks has also been shown to besignificantly correlated with increases in the incidence of TBE in Stockholm County  (59.2&#x000b0;N) during the period 1960&#x02013;1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therisks of LB are likely to increase as well because <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> sensu lato (s.l.) spirochetes have been foundin <italic>I. ricinus</italic> throughout its range inSweden  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>A comparable situation has been reported in changes to thealtitude distribution of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> in the mountainous regions of the Czech Republic. Field studiesin 1957 and in 1979-80 showed thatticks were prevalent up to 700 meters above sea level. Ticks were collectedfrom dogs or by drag-sampling in the same locations in 2001 and 2002 and werethen found as high as 1100 meters in areas where they had been absent fromsmall mammal samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and where it has been shown that they couldnot complete their life cycle over the period 1957&#x02013;1983 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, the prevalence of ticks carrying the TBE virus or <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> s. l. spirochetes alsoseems to have increased at high altitude in the Czech Republic  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="subsec2.2"><title>2.2. Dermacentor reticulatus</title><p>					<italic>Dermacentor reticulatus</italic> is a vector ofcanine babesiosis, tularemia, Q-fever, and at least one zoonotic rickettsiosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and hasvector competence for <italic>Anaplasma marginale</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Unlike <italic>I. ricinus</italic>, only the adults quest for hosts on surfacevegetation and they feed primarily on deer, frequently bite dogs, but onlyoccasionally humans, whereas the larvae and nymphs parasitize rodents. The lifecycle is much shorter than that of <italic>I. ricinus</italic>, with eggs deposited in the spring anddeveloping to adults within the same year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The geographic range of the species extends from France and southwest England in the west to central Asia in the east. Inwestern and central Europe its northern limit is northern Germany, northern Poland,and Lithuania, and itssouthern limit is theMediterranean shore (restricted to humid mountainous areas), whereas it has amore northern distribution in the east (St.  Petersburg). Within this area, its distribution ishighly focal, and within Germany  in 1976, it was only reported from four sites out of more than 3000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In two recent studies, however, data were collected showingthat this tick species has since colonized many more sites in Germany  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The first study (2003) consisted of the screening of 365 dogs from 171 sites. Almost 10% of the ticks from 41 dogs were <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> and the infested dogs came from 26 sites, all previouslyunknown for the tick. Seven of the sites were subsequently confirmed byflagging. In the second study (2004), 721 deer were shot at 201 sites from 161districts and their heads examined for ticks. A total of 23 (3.2%) deer from 14sites were infested and only two sites were already known for <italic>D. reticulatus.</italic> These results stronglysuggest that <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> hasexpanded its range within the last three decades particularly in the easternand southwestern parts of Germany. Further evidence for the changing distribution of <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> is provided by the occurrence of canine babesiosisin new areas of Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], Hungary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], Switzerland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and the Netherlands  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Several factors, perhaps acting synergistically, could beresponsible for this recent spread of <italic>D. reticulatus</italic>, including increased deer abundance and the availability ofmore fallow land as a result of EU agricultural policies. However, there aregood reasons for implicating a warming climate as being at least partlyinvolved. Habitats with adult <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> are all characterized by more or less intense solar radiationand it is likely that the temperature sum (cumulative day-degrees above the developmental zero within one vegetationperiod) at the soil surface is alimiting factor for oviposition and embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The fact that <italic>D. reticulatus</italic> occurs further north ineastern Europe supports this view, since the continental climate there ischaracterized by higher summer temperatures. Whereas adults are cold-hardy andcan survive continental winters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], eggs and larvae that do not completedevelopment would not have survived the cold season of a few decades ago incentral Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Further research toclarify the situation could focus on suitable habitats in the north of Germany. </p></sec><sec id="subsec2.3"><title>2.3. Hyalomma marginatum</title><p>					<italic>H. marginatum</italic> is well known as a vector of the dangerous viral zoonosisCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Its possible northern spread andestablishment of permanent populations is thus of much significance, especiallysince immature stages are frequently found on migratory birds flying totemperate Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The life cycle of thistick is faster in southern parts of its distribution range (Northern Africa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] with larvae active as early as February, but clearlyslower in northern, colder regions, with immatures active as late as June. Analysis of the recorded distribution of the tick show that, according toclimate requirements, there are two clear clusters of populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Onecluster extends from the northern geographical limit of the species in theBalkans (approx., latitude 44&#x000b0;N) and into Turkey and the Middle East. The second one isrestricted to Africa north of the Sahara and western parts of Spain. Analysisof the climate niche of the first cluster clearly points to atemperature-related limiting factor for these northern populations. Temperaturesbetween September and December are critical for the establishment of permanentpopulations. Cumulative temperatures between September and December have anaverage of 800&#x000b0;C in places where the tick has permanent populations, and below400&#x000b0;C in sites not colonized by <italic>H. marginatum</italic>. This finding seems to be related to the factors that affectmolting of immature stages and are not connected to the extremely cold wintertemperatures that prevent overwintering adults surviving into the next year, assuggested by Hoogstraal et al.  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. If temperatures are high enough to allow moltingbefore the cold winters, unfed adults can survive the next active season. Fieldobservations (Z. Vatansever, personal comment) recorded the feeding of nymphsin late summer in Turkey,with the resulting unfed flat adults commonly overwintering in the first fewcentimeters below the soil surface. Regulatory variables for these northernpopulations appear to act on thermodependent phases of the tick life cycle. Onthe other hand, climate niche analysis of the southern cluster of tickcommunities points to a strict dependence on rainfall and potentialevaporation, but this may not be relevant if specimens from the southern rangecan adapt to the colder conditions of the northern cluster.</p><p>Although migratory birds are carriers of immature <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks and could potentiallyintroduce them into currently <italic>Hyalomma</italic>-freeareas in the spring, their climate requirements and current climate data do notsuggest that they can become established. Mid-March and early April are themain periods of mass arrival of birds in Spain on their way to northern Europe. Data obtainedfrom the Climate Research Unit (UK) show that average temperature in thatperiod is 16-17&#x000b0;C in Morocco and Mauritania,9&#x02013;11&#x000b0;C in southern Spain, and 5-6&#x000b0;C in southern Germany. According to data on molting of engorged nymphs under laboratory conditions,about 300&#x000b0;C cumulative degrees above the developmental zero (14&#x02013;16&#x000b0;C) arenecessary to complete the molt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Nymphs that engorge at the time of migratorybird arrival in early spring would need much longer to molt in southern Germany, with a consequent increase in mortality, than innorth-western Africa, where only a few weeksare required. In the current climaticconditions, it is highly improbable that engorged nymphs can survive insufficient numbers to be founders of new permanent populations in Europe. Immature <italic>H. marginatum</italic> are found on local (nonmigratory) birds in central Spain aroundlate May and early June, which is too late for northern African and southernEuropean populations of <italic>H. marginatum</italic> to mix because of thecurrent climate barriers imposed by their respective climate requirements atthe moment of bird migration. Ifclimate change includes the predicted temperature increases, <italic>H. marginatum</italic> ticks may become established innorthern latitudes but it is debatable whether initial introduction will occuras a result of bird migration alone because very small numbers of ticks, allimmature stages, would be involved. It is more likely that, as autumn andwinter temperatures rise, establishment of <italic>H. marginatum</italic> will mainly resultfrom the introduction of adult females feeding on wild and domestic ruminantsvia the Middle East and the Balkans, wherethere is much uncontrolled movement of livestock.</p></sec><sec id="subsec2.4"><title>2.4. Rhipicephalus sanguineus</title><p>A special case of distribution and association toenvironmental variables is that of the brown dog tick, <italic>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</italic>. It has a worldwide distribution mainlybecause of introduction by dogs, but rarely occurs in temperate and coldregions. However, <italic>R. sanguineus</italic> is anendophilous tick (associated with shelters like kennels, private gardens, orcracks in walls of human constructions), so may potentially cause temporaryinfestations in heated accommodation anywhere in the world. Within its normalrange, <italic>R. sanguineus</italic> can reach hugepopulations under adequate environmental conditions and continued presence of ablood source. Currently, the brown dog tick is extremely common around theMediterranean region. In the coldest places of this region, the tick mayundergo a winter dormancy within the cracks of the walls, while in localitieswith warmer winters continuing activity may take place. Only sporadic cases ofinfestation by <italic>R. sanguineus</italic> havebeen described in central and northern Europe.</p><p>Studies on infestations in some Mediterraneancities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] showed that permanent populations of the tick are absent inapartments where dogs are present, even without any kind of ixodicidetreatment. However, the tick is present and may occur in large numbers in smallprivate gardens and kennels of houses (or even within houses) in the outskirts. These country-type houses are very common in the Mediterranean region. Hourlyclimate data recorded by probes installed indoor and outdoor in these differenttypes of construction showed that adequate humidity is a critical factor forsuccessful establishment of indoor populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In central Europe, there are no humidity restrictions for thedevelopment of the tick in the private gardens or kennels and spring and summertemperatures are the only limitation. Recent studies on climate features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]have shown that particular events, such as the heat wave in Europe in 2003, can result in temporary conditions adequate for the development andmolting of immature stages. It is clear that despite the endophilous nature ofthis tick species, climatic conditions in the outer environment are criticalfor its long-term establishment in an area. An increase of about 2-3&#x000b0;C in the averagetemperature from April&#x02013;September couldresult in the establishment of permanent populations of the tick in regions ofnorthern temperate Europe where it iscurrently absent.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec3"><title>3. Effects of Climate Change on the SeasonalAactivity of Ticks</title><sec id="subsec3.1"><title>3.1. Winter Activity of Ixodes ricinus</title><p>It iscommon knowledge that the seasonal activity of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> nymphs and adults extends from March to October in mostparts of central Europe, whereas the larval stage begins questing only in May,at least in Berlin  forests (Kahl and Dautel, unpublished). In contrast to parts of the British Isles, any tick activity from mid-November tomid-February is unusual in that region. The strong influence thattemperature can exert on tick activity patterns, even in the cold season, wasdemonstrated in eastern Germany  in the extraordinarily mild winter of 2006/7. Thecontinuously warm-to-mild autumn in 2006 (1st September to 30th November),which was 3.4&#x000b0;C warmer than the long-term mean for 1961&#x02013;90, was followedby a winter (1st December to 28th February) 4.6&#x000b0;C milder than thelong-term mean (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dwd.de">http://www.dwd.de</ext-link>, data from Potsdam) with only two days with amaximum temperature  &#x0003c;0&#x000b0;C. On prepared field plots in a Berlin forest,questing adult <italic>I. ricinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)were found on every observation date throughout the winter (early November toearly March) and questing nymphal ticks were absent on only two out of 19occasions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Moreover, Dautel and colleagues collected 88 nymphs and sevenadult <italic>I. ricinus</italic> in two man-hours by flagging 1000 m<sup>2</sup> in a nearby forest in mid-January 2007. At the same localityon another occasion in mid-February, nymphal and adult questing tick abundancewas still higher (temperature maximum on both days approximately 7&#x000b0;C).</p><p>This is agood example of how flexible the seasonal questing activity of this widespreadvector tick can be if the temperature conditions change from the local norm. The unusual registration of four cases of human TBE (a notifiable disease in Germany) in early 2007 (early January to lateFebruary) shows that there was some tick questing activity in other parts of Germany  as wellduring that winter. If wintertemperatures generally increase in the future, it can be assumed that seasonalperiods with no questing <italic>I. ricinus</italic> will become shorter in central Europe. It isevident that winter activity of vector ticks distinctly increases the risk forforest visitors of an infectious tick bite, especially if they do not expectticks to be active at that time of the year. It is unclear, however, what the chancesare for a winter-active tick to find a host at that time (because of reducedhost abundance in winter though this may also change with the advent of warmerwinters). It is also unclear how winter activity may affect the remainingseasonal activity pattern (winter-active ticks spend precious energy) orwhether any changes in the seasonal activity of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> nymphs and adults are beneficial or detrimental for theperpetuation of tick-borne pathogens. The infection of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> larvae during feeding is a crucial step in the circulationof many tick-borne pathogens and the effects of higher ambient temperatures onthe seasonal activity of larvae and its chances to find a suitable host may beof great significance in determining the prevalence of some tick-bornediseases.</p></sec><sec id="subsec3.2"><title>3.2. Summer Activity of Ixodes ricinus</title><p>In 1976the early summer weather in County Wicklow, Ireland,included maximum air temperatures of  29&#x02013;31&#x000b0;C recorded onsheep pastures where <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> activity was being studied. Such monthly maxima in early summer may be the rulerather than the exception in this region in the coming decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Retrospective use was made of 1976 summer temperature and tick data in anexamination of the effects of high temperatures on tick development and activityin relation to the predicted global warming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In most parts of its range, <italic>I. ricinus</italic> shows some degree of bimodalseasonal activity and in 1975, more ticks were collected in autumn than inspring/summer, which may be attributed to the presence of hosts on theseparticular sheep pastures in late summer and autumn but not in spring or earlysummer for several years. However, by 1977, the pattern of tick activity hadchanged dramatically and more than 90% nymphal activity occurred from March toJune. It was postulated that the elevated early and mid-summer temperatures of1976 were the primary cause of the change from autumn tospring/summer-dominated nymphal activity.</p><p>This possibility was investigated by studies on tickdevelopment under quasi-natural conditions. The threshold period for depositedengorged larvae to enter a developmental diapause was identified as the firsttwo weeks of August, after which time larvae overwintered in an engorged stateand did not reappear as nymphs until the following autumn. The tick abundancedata suggested that the 1975 autumn-feeding adults gave rise to larvae that fedpredominantly in the prediapause period, so that they had the opportunity tooverwinter as unfed nymphs and thus join the spring-active ticks in 1977. Thisinterpretation was supported by a degree-day development model for <italic>I. ricinus</italic> originally described byGardiner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], that predicted the appearance of larvae from autumn-laideggs a month earlier when exposed to 1976 temperatures than when exposed tomore normal temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The high summer temperatures of 1976 hadapparently transferred ticks from an autumn-active cohort to a spring-activeone. The process revealed by this study suggests that after hotter summers muchof the host-seeking activity of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> will occur in late autumn, to a lesser extent in the winter months, and withstrong activity again in early spring. Larval activity is likely to be mainlyrestricted to mid-summer (as long as humidity requirements are satisfied) withthe majority of larvae avoiding developmental diapause and becoming active asnymphs in late autumn or early spring of the following year. Interestingly,this pattern of activity is very similar to that of the American <italic>I. scapularis</italic> in New Jersey, USA  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], where air temperatures exceed  26&#x000b0;C for 50&#x02013;60 days of theyear. Suitable studies in southern Europe have not been undertaken, but asimilar phenology to the predicted scenario for <italic>I. ricinus</italic> in hot summers was described in a recent comprehensivestudy in central Spain  where maximum summer air temperatures generally reach 26&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It might beexpected that with low precipitation in hot summers, survival and activity ofticks such as <italic>I. ricinus,</italic> which is very susceptible todesiccation, would be reduced. Indeed, it has been reported that in Switzerland saturation deficits depressednymphal and adult <italic>I. ricinus</italic> activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, Irishdata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] showed that all active stages of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> will quest throughout hot dry weather as long asappropriate vegetation cover is present to provide opportunities forrehydration. The same  situation appears to obtain for <italic>I. scapularis</italic> immature stages in the USA  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>It seems likely that with increased global warming, <italic>I. ricinus</italic> activity will occur more in theautumn and winter months in many areas and, furthermore, a greater proportionof the tick population may be active at this time than at present, with aconsequent temporal change in the risk of tick-borne diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec4"><title>4. The Role of Modeling in Analysis ofClimate Change Effects on Ticks</title><sec id="subsec4.1"><title>4.1. Climate Suitability Modeling</title><p>Climate suitability for a tick population can be defined asthe fitness of a set of climatic conditions for the existence of thatpopulation in a given region. However, many other factors operating at differentlevels restrict the effective dispersal and establishment of potentialinvaders. Thus, while the climate in a particular location may be suitable fora given tick species, the potential for dispersal there and the ability toestablish a new viable population may be very low. Furthermore, microclimaticvariables such as soil surface temperature and relative humidity (which areaffected by such things as slope and aspect, snow cover, vegetation, litterlayer, humus and underlying soils) may be crucial in determining thedistribution pattern of specific niches for tick survival within an area. Mostdata on climate preferences of ticks have been empirically derived fromdescriptions of the abiotic components of the environmental niche, as definedby the climate-supported native populations, and based on the assumption thatthey are homogeneously distributed in the native area.</p><p>The basic concept underlying species occurrencemodeling is the definition of the ecological niche: each species is foundwithin specific ranges for environmental variables that support individualsurvival and reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We refer here to climate instead ofenvironmental or ecological space because these studies are aimed atunderstanding the relationship of ticks to climate, and ignore other basicaspects, such as vegetation patterns or host abundance, that are also involvedin delineation of the &#x0201c;ecological&#x0201d; preferences of a tick species or population. Species occurrence can be predicted by inclusion of appropriate climate variablesin what are commonly referred to as climate suitability models (CSMs): therelationships are generalized from a sample of correlations of species presencewith specific values of environmental variables. While it is well recognizedthat the climate niche space occupied by a species across its geographic rangemay vary, this is rarely considered in current modeling approaches despite itsobvious importance. When regional climate niche variations occur, a CSM derivedfor a particular area may not apply to other areas, and a model derived from alarge area may have comparatively weak local predictive power. A widely heldassumption in traditional models of tick distribution is that responses ofspecies to environmental gradients are unimodal and symmetrical. Thus, climatesuitability is predicted to decline from central (and ecologically optimal)areas of a species' range towards the periphery. In suboptimal conditions, aspecies may compensate for physiological stress by a shift in niche position. For wide-ranging species, suitable ecological conditions may vary considerablybetween different regions within the range.</p><p>However, these CSM are unsuitable if anadequate understanding of the factors operating over the transmission of adisease is necessary. The many variables involved in such processes, likehosts, densities of questing infected ticks, and a perception of the smallscale of foci, are only adequately addressed with models designed to describeseasonal dynamics. While some models with biological content have been producedfor tick species such as <italic>Boophilusmicroplus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], <italic>Amblyomma americanum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], and <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>],none are currently available for European ticks. Such models are a priority toadequately understand the impact of climate change on tick populations,provided that adequate data are used for important components such as hostdensities and microhabitat suitability. However, despite the absence of suchdata in climate suitability models, these models have proved useful in theelucidation of tick-borne disease foci for the recent outbreak of CCHF in Turkey  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="subsec4.2"><title>4.2. Recent (100 Years) Changes in Climate Suitability forIxodes ricinus</title><p>Both regional climaticrequirement variations and the existence of  &#x0201c;demes&#x0201d; (defined as populations ofclosely related interbreeding organisms of the same species with differingresponses to the wide array of climate factors occurring across thegeographical range of the species) have been demonstrated for <italic>I. ricinus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The study revealed at least 10distinct <italic>I. ricinus</italic> groups with apattern of distribution closely overlapping with the presence of previouslyreported phenotypic forms of the species, and is in general agreement with a16S mitochondrial rDNA study of genetic variation in <italic>I. ricinus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The importance of these findings is that the climateand vegetation features correlated with the genetic groups in the whole tickmetapopulation, with different populations having specific climaticrequirements and unique genetic fingerprints. A study on the changes in climatesuitability for <italic>I. ricinus</italic> in the western Palearctic hasbeen carried out using deme-derived models based on the different populationsrecognized in the Palaearctic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The distribution records available for thedifferent demes were used to build partial models (i.e., applied to regions ofthe whole distribution range) from which a complete map for the whole regionwas produced. The study used a long (1900&#x02013;1999) series ofclimate data at coarse resolution (10 minutes of arc) to examine the trends inclimate and to estimate sustained variations in climate suitability for <italic>I. ricinus</italic>. While some areas showed adeterministic (i.e., continuous) tendency towards increasing or decreasingsuitability for the tick, others showed unambiguous cycles of climatesuitability, termed areas of random walk. In these, populations of the tick mayundergo periodical variations in their geographical range as a consequence ofcyclic changes in climate.</p><p>This analysis suggests that while climatesuitability for <italic>I. ricinus</italic> did notchange in a large area of Europe during the100-year study period, it increased in specific geographically limitedlocations and decreased in  others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>These changes are not recent and are associated with yearlyand summer rainfall patterns rather than with temperature. The reportedincreased abundance of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> inparts of Europe (e.g., Sweden  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]) coincides geographically with the regions where a recent increase inclimate suitability has been detected, within zones having a marked random walktendency. Thus, the observation of higher tick abundance in recent years maynot be due to a permanent shift in tick populations, but rather because thelong-term climate cycle, which varies on a wide timescale, has been in a phasethat is favorable to tick survival. No single variable was consistently associatedin the study period with changes in climate suitability across sites whererandom walk was detected. The absence of a single regulatory variable seems tobe connected with the different climate niche experienced by the tickpopulations in their distribution area. Thus, rainfall and temperature havedifferent regulatory abilities according to the portion of the tick's climateenvelope represented in a given area.</p></sec><sec id="subsec4.3"><title>4.3. An Overview of the Climate Suitability for Ticks inthe Mediterranean Region</title><p>The Mediterranean region is expected to experience profoundchanges in climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and furthermore, its close proximity to the Africancontinent makes it a particularly sensitive area to invasion by ticks currentlyrestricted to northern Africa. It is,therefore, of interest to explore the predicted impact of climate changes onthe suitability for ticks. The ticks involved (genera <italic>Boophilus</italic>, <italic>Dermacentor</italic>, <italic>Rhipicephalus,</italic> and <italic>Hyalomma</italic>) find their maximum suitability in Mediterranean typevegetation, including areas with cold winters and dry summers, and areprevalent in wide areas of that region, extending well into the Middle East. Most of them are vectors of pathogens ofanimals and humans. Predicted changes in climate are also expected to have aserious impact on the vegetation structure, driving the area toward a moreopen, brush-like vegetation, where these ticks find their ecological optima.</p><p>Anestimation of the climate niches for each of these ticks has already been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Global climate models remain relatively coarse in terms of spatial resolution;this compromised the desired resolution of that analysis. To address thisproblem, new climate layers were created with monthly increases and decreasesin temperature of 1 and 2&#x000b0;C, and monthly variations in rainfall of 60, 80, 120,and 140% of actual values. For each combination of temperature and rainfall,the climate suitability for each species in the region was evaluated. Thebaseline climate suitability was used as a framework to compute the impact ofthe different changes of climate over the expansion or retraction of thegeographical range for each species. The expected impact is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>For <italic>B. annulatus</italic> and <italic>H. excavatum</italic>, an increase in temperature would lead to an increasein suitability within regions of northern Africa and limited parts of southern Europe. Changes in rainfall are predicted to have littlegeographic impact on <italic>B. annulatus</italic> (which in any case is a one-host-tick that is much less exposed to ambientconditions than three-host-ticks), but they show a clear effect on <italic>H. excavatum.</italic></p><p>In the case of <italic>D. marginatus</italic>, a decrease in temperatureresults in an increase in the extent of adequate suitability in northernAfrica, most of coastal southern Europe, and wide areas of southern Spain,whereas an increase in temperature would result in a northward expansion of thesuitable habitat for this species. Changes in rainfall result in similareffects to those described for the above-mentioned changes in temperature. Large areas of Europe would potentially beaffected by an increase in the climate suitability for <italic>Rhipicephalus</italic> spp. and <italic>H. marginatum</italic> after an increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall. Decreasing temperatures in Europe arepredicted to result in habitat loss for <italic>B. annulatus, R. bursa,</italic> and <italic>H. marginatum</italic>. Again, we must stress that this is an evaluation of the climatesuitability for these tick species, since changes in vegetation, hostavailability, and animal movements were not included in the models.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec5"><title>5. Effects on Tick-Borne Diseases in Europe</title><p>All the tick species considered in the earlier sections are important vectors ofdisease and an increasing incidence of these diseases is the most significantpotential outcome of climate changes that affect ticks, directly or indirectly. As described above, there is little doubt that <italic>Dermacentor reticulatus</italic> is currently extending its range and thisis reflected in the occurrence of canine babesiosis (caused by <italic>Babesia canis canis</italic>) in new areas (24,25, 26, 27, 28). <italic>Hyalomma marginatum</italic> isone of the vectors of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), which occurs inparts of Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and south-east Europe. The largest epidemic on-record occurred in Turkey, which started in 2002 andis still ongoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and further north, a recent outbreak was reported in theBalkans, another known endemic area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], but there is no evidence as yet thatthis disease is spreading further northwards. However, as discussed above, thepotential for the introduction and establishment of vector populations in areasof predicted climate suitability is increasing.</p><p>				<italic>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</italic> is the primary vector of Mediterranean-spottedfever (a rickettsial zoonosis caused by <italic>Rickettsiaconorii</italic>), and also <italic>Ehrlichia canis</italic> and <italic>Babesia canis vogeli</italic> (causing, resp., rickettsial and protozoal diseases ofdogs). Although <italic>R. sanguineus</italic> can establishin kennels in central and northern European latitudes, thus potentially causingshort-lived localized disease outbreaks, sufficient survival in the externalenvironment does not seem to occur for significant disease transmission innorthern temperate Europe. Nevertheless,concerns about its possible introduction and establishment have prompted the authorities in some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, to make treatment againstticks a component of the pet-passport scheme.</p><p>				<italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> is the most abundant and widespread tick in Europe andtogether with the Eurasian species, <italic>I. persulcatus</italic>,transmits Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). LB occurs ata relatively high incidence for a zoonotic disease, ranging from 155 per100,000 in Slovenia to 0.6per 100,000 in Ireland  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. However, it is difficult to statistically relate LB incidence to climatechange because the reliability of incidence data is uncertain due to diagnostic problems andlimited or absent reporting in most countries. Nevertheless, in some regions,it has proved possible to relate disease incidence to climate, and a positiveassociation of incidence with mild winters and warm, humid summers was reportedin southern Sweden  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. The suggested effect of mild winters is possibly due to an extension ofthe tick activity season, resulting in increased numbers of infected ticksbecoming available in the following year. Warm humid summers might result in a moreefficient transmission by the vector, but there is limited evidence for thisand the authors suggest that the observed increased LB incidence may be due toincreased human exposure in these conditions.</p><p>Since TBE is notifiable in most countries where it occurs,current incidence data are more reliable than those for LB, even thoughreporting standards differ between countries and there are increasingdifferences in TBE vaccination rates between countries. Increases in Swedishcases since the mid-80s were associated with two consecutive years with milderwinters, earlier arrival of spring and prolonged autumn periods withtemperatures above 5&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thepossibility that this is caused by climate effects on ticks is suggested by thenorthward extension of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Similarly, an upward movement of the TBE prevalence altitude ceilingcorrelating with increasing temperatures has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], whichaccords with reports of increasing numbers of active ticks at higher altitudes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Detecting climatic effectson the incidence of LB and TBE in areas close to the latitude and altitudedistribution limits of the vector is less complex than in other parts of Europe where the direct and indirect impacts of climatechange on disease incidence are often confounded by other factors. Such studiesshould either be based on reliable long-term historical datasets in an area(e.g., the 40 year surveillance program for TBE in Stockholm County, Sweden[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]) or based on data from different regions or countries, collected withsimilar methodologies (e.g., vector sampling and analysis) and subject tosimilar variations (e.g., TBE vaccination rates and reporting criteria). Thereis a need for a pan-European surveillance network, for example based on theabundance of infected vectors, as suggested by WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>Randolph et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] correlated the occurrence ofsynchronous activity of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> larvaeand nymphs (resulting in cofeeding transmission) with that of TBE cases, andalso reported a relationship between these two variables and the rate ofdecline of autumn temperatures. It, therefore, seems likely that climate changewill affect the dynamics of TBE transmission, thus altering the distribution of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], but the exact mechanisms of this interaction remainto be elucidated.</p><p>Despite the ready availability of data on TBE incidence, a firm causalrelationship with climate change remains elusive. A detailed study of therecords of TBE incidence over the last 2-3 decades inEstonia, Latvia, and Lithuania showed that although TBE incidence rosedramatically in some areas, there was so much heterogeneity in the data that itwas impossible to identify climate change as the main factor driving increaseddisease incidence. It was concluded that the many socioeconomic changes arisingfrom the end of Soviet rule probably acted synergistically with climate factorsto increase TBE incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec6"><title>6. Conclusions</title><p>Transmissionof infection occurs when there is an overlap of activities betweenreservoir, vector, and humans, and differs according to the pathogens and thelocation. Climate change may impact all of these stages and theirinteractions. Although changes in climate and in the lengthof the different seasons will directly affect tick survival, activity, anddevelopment, there is no good evidence that rising temperatures will result ina greater abundance of ticks by simply increasing rates of development; ratherchanges in development rates will make tick cohorts available to differentdiapause windows (largely determined by day length), thus changing patterns ofseasonal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Indirect effects of climate change will impact thenumber of infected ticks by affecting vegetation. For example, a warmingclimate in central Europe is likely to result in a decrease of Norway spruce (<italic>Picea abies</italic>) and the areas involved willprobably be colonized by beech (<italic>Fagussylvatica</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], the fallen leaves of which provide a favorablemicroclimate for survival of the free-living tick stages. Additionally, climatechange will also have indirect effects on tick-borne pathogen transmission byaffecting the survival and abundance of tick maintenance hosts, such as deer,and pathogen-reservoir hosts such as rodents and birds. Climate change may alsoinfluence disease risk by affecting the long-term use of land (e.g., farming,tourism, etc.), and weather patterns have an effect by influencing short-termhuman behavior such as picnics and mushroom picking. Climate effects are moreeasily noticeable close to the geographical distribution limits of both vectorand disease. The magnitude of the effects of climate change in an endemic areadepends on local conditions and vulnerability, and is determined not only byecological conditions but may be influenced by socioeconomic factors, humanmigration and settlement, ecosystems and biodiversity, migrating patterns ofbirds, land-use and land cover changes, human cultural and behavioral patterns,and immunity in the population. Since some of these conditions are in turninfluenced by climate change, a complex chain of processes exists that makesthe precise factors responsible for changes in disease incidence oftendifficult to determine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. A further difficulty in determining futurescenarios is presented by the fact that the predominant tick species in Europe, <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> is extremely flexibleand adaptable and can exhibit rather different seasonal activity even inadjacent parts of its geographical range. Much current research effort attemptsto match datasets collected for different purposes and in order to reduceconfounding variables, it is evident that data from long-term studies ondisease incidence, tick biology, tick distribution and tick abundance, hostabundance and distribution, and relevant vegetation biology, specifically inrelation to climate change, are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Such data will permit thedevelopment of models to predict future tick-borne disease scenarios, whichtake account of dynamic biological processes instead of simply the likelihoodof occurrence of climate suitability for particular tick species.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors are grateful to Bernard Kaye (UniversityCollege Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland) for assistance informatting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Randolph</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evidence that climate change has caused &#x02018;emergence&#x02019; of tick-borne diseases in Europe?</article-title><source><italic>International Journal of Medical Microbiology</italic></source><year>2004</year><volume>293</volume><issue>supplement 37</issue><fpage>5</fpage><lpage>15</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15146980</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The development and seasonal activity of the tick <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic>: a vector of Lyme borreliosis</article-title><source><italic>Review of Medical and Veterinary Entomology</italic></source><year>1991</year><volume>79</volume><issue>6</issue><fpage>323</fpage><lpage>333</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Christensen</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Hewitson</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Busuioc</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Solomon</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Manning</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Regional climate projections</article-title><source><italic>Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.
