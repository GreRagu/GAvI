The recycling of CI-MPR from the plasma membrane to the trans-Golgi network was also impaired.

PD is caused by mutations in the acid &#x003b1;-glucosidase (<italic>GAA</italic>) gene, encoding the lysosomal hydrolase &#x003b1;-glucosidase (acid maltase, GAA, E.C.3.2.1.20). GAA is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum as a 110 kDa precursor, which undergoes N-glycan processing in the Golgi apparatus, and is proteolytically processed in the lysosomes into active polypeptides of 76 and 70 kDa, through an intermediate molecular form of 95 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In PD, glycogen accumulation occurs in almost every organ and system, but is particularly evident in skeletal muscle and heart, the sites of the most debilitating clinical manifestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Different mutations of the <italic>GAA </italic>gene result in a wide phenotypic spectrum, with respect to age of onset of manifestations, rate of disease progression and variable association of symptoms. The different clinical forms of PD range from a devastating classic infantile phenotype, characterized by early onset, severe cardiomyopathy and early lethality, to intermediate phenotypes and late onset (childhood, juvenile or adult) forms in which cardiac involvement is absent or mild [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The past two decades have been characterized by impressive progress in the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), with the development of innovative therapies, including haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], substrate reduction therapy (SRT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and enzyme enhancement therapy (EET) by pharmacological chaperons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Among these approaches, ERT represented a major breakthrough in the treatment of LSDs, initially used for the treatment of Gaucher disease and now available for several other LSDs.</p><p>ERT with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) is presently the only approach for the treatment of PD patients. The first clinical trials, based on the use of an enzyme derived from transgenic rabbits, demonstrated that ERT was effective in improving cardiomyopathy, survival, growth and motor function in classic infantile PD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. ERT has been subsequently extended to PD patients with other phenotypes. The results of the published studies showed dramatic improvements of cardiac, respiratory and motor function in some patients, whereas in others ERT failed to cause significant clinical improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This suggests that the clinical outcome in response to ERT may be variable, correlating with histological evidence of poor glycogen clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and that correction of glycogen storage in skeletal muscle is particularly challenging. Factors such as age at the start of treatment, stage of skeletal muscle damage, antibody responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], insufficient targeting of rhGAA to skeletal muscle and high clearance of the enzyme by the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] play a role in ERT efficacy, although the reasons for the variable responses of different PD patients are not completely clear and other factors, such as patients' genotype and abnormalities of cell functions, may also be implicated.</p><p>We postulated that an impairment of house-keeping cellular functions and membrane trafficking resulting from abnormal substrate storage is an additional and important factor influencing the efficacy of ERT in PD, and possibly in other LSDs.</p><p>To date, several studies have pointed to the role of a variety of structural and biochemical responses triggered by intracellular storage, which are considered to be responsible for the pathogenetic manifestation of LSDs. These abnormalities include activation of inflammation by cytokines, impairment of the autophagic pathway, alterations of signal transduction pathways, altered calcium homeostasis and apoptosis and abnormalities of intracellular trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Abnormal intracellular trafficking of lipids and proteins may affect the function of membrane-bound proteins, such as receptors, and ligands. The cation-independent 300 kDa mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) is of particular interest as it is a key player in the internalization of exogenous enzymes, and for the possible consequences of deranged CI-MPR function on ERT efficacy. CI-MPR is an integral membrane glycoprotein that follows a complex and finely regulated itinerary from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it binds newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases, travels through the early endosomes towards the late endosomal compartments, and recycles back to the TGN. At the steady state, a fraction (approximately 10%) of CI-MPR is located on cell surface, where it mediates the uptake of lysosomal enzymes, is internalized in the early endocytic compartment and then recycled again to the plasma membrane through the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>To address the consequences of abnormalities of cellular morphology and function on CI-MPR subcellular localization, we studied fibroblasts from PD patients with different genotypes and phenotypes. We demonstrated that in these cells, which showed abnormalities of cellular morphology, CI-MPR is mislocalized and its availability at the plasma membrane is reduced. These abnormalities in CI-MPR distribution result in a less efficient uptake of rhGAA by PD fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PD fibroblasts show abnormalities of cell morphology</title><p>In order to determine whether PD fibroblasts display abnormalities of cell morphology and trafficking we took advantage of five fibroblast cell lines from PD patients with different genotypes and associated phenotypes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Some of these structures had features typical of endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, black asterisks), while others exhibited features typical of autophagosomes (white asterisks), with double membranes (black arrows) and cytoplasmic-like content. In intermediate and severe PD fibroblasts, glycogen storage (white arrows) was evident as electron-dense spots either within endolysosomes and autophagosomes or dispersed in the cytoplasm. The percentage of endolysosome volume occupied by glycogen ranged from 14% in juvenile PD fibroblasts, to 43% in intermediate PD fibroblasts to 65% in severe PD fibroblasts. On average, MVBs and autophagosomes appeared to be more prominent in cells from severely affected patient as compared with control cells and with cells from patients with milder phenotypes, suggesting an expansion of the autophagic compartment in severe PD fibroblasts.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Pompe disease fibroblasts show expansion of the autophagic compartment</bold>.

This pattern was most prominent in PD fibroblasts from patients with the severe and intermediate forms. Starvation of cells in amino acid-deprived EBSS medium resulted in increased LC3 signal in controls and in juvenile PD fibroblasts, whereas no substantial change in LC3 staining was appreciable in severe and intermediate PD cells. To perform a quantitative analysis of LC3-positive spots at steady state and under basal culturing conditions, confocal images from control and PD fibroblasts stained with anti-LC3 antibody were processed by ImageJ (using the analysing particles module and considering as minimum size four pixels). The cells from controls and severe PD were classified into three groups based on the number of LC3-positive spots (1 to 10 spots, 11 to 40 spots and 41 to 200 spots).

In PD fibroblasts the initial amount of fluorescence measured at 18&#x000b0;C was reduced but the internalized fluorescence remained fairly constant, leading to an inversion of the rate between control and PD cells 15 to 30 minutes after the temperature shift (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). This indicates that the antibody-CI-MPR complexes are sequestered in PD cells and do not efficiently recycle to the plasma membrane and/or deliver the antibody to the late endosomes/lysosomes.</p><p>To assess whether the recycling defect of CI-MPR observed in PD fibroblasts was accompanied by a general defect in clathrin-mediated endocytosis we analyzed the uptake of transferrin (Tf). The internalization of fluorescent Tf in the early endocytic compartment was studied, keeping the cells at 18&#x000b0;C for 60 minutes. The distribution of Tf and transferrin receptor (TR) in control and mutant cells was not substantially different (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>), suggesting that PD cells do not have a general defect in clathrin-mediated endocytosis but a selective impairment of CI-MPR trafficking and recycling along the endocytic pathway.</p><p>In order to understand where the cycling of CI-MPR is arrested we investigated the nature of the peripheral structures positive for CI-MPR observed at the steady state in PD fibroblasts. We found that a significant fraction of them were positive for the autophagosome marker LC3 in intermediate and severe PD fibroblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). To gain insight into which fraction of CI-MPR came in contact with autophagosomes, whether the one moving from the TGN to the early and late endosomes, or the one recycling back from the plasma membrane, we followed this latter fraction through the internalized CI-MPR antibody. The coefficient of co-localization was analyzed in cell populations identified by the number of LC3-positive spots. In PD fibroblasts we found that over time an increasing amount of the CI-MPR antibody co-localized with LC3, particularly in the fraction of cells showing the highest accumulation of LC3-positive spots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>).

We therefore investigated the uptake of rhGAA in PD cells. Fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of variable concentrations of rhGAA for 24 hours (to obtain substantial and easily measurable enzyme activity within cells and to allow processing of the precursor into the mature active 76 kDa GAA molecular forms). Different enzyme concentrations (0.5, 5, 50 &#x003bc;g/ml) of rhGAA in the medium were used to study the uptake in a range of concentrations in which CI-MPR is not saturated. The correction of enzyme activity with the lowest concentration (0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml)  was negligible, whereas GAA activity was measurable after incubation with the highest rhGAA concentrations. Correction of GAA deficiency was less efficient in fibroblasts from patients with severe phenotypes, as compared with the activity attained in cells from juvenile patients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>). Cells from intermediate patients showed intermediate GAA levels after incubation with rhGAA. All cell lines showed similar growth rates, suggesting that the differences in GAA uptake were not correlated to cellular growth. Uptake of rhGAA was completely abolished by the addition to the culture medium of 5 mM mannose-6-phosphate, thus confirming that enzyme uptake was CI-MPR-dependent (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>The uptake of rhGAA is defective in fibroblasts from severe and intermediate Pompe disease patients</bold>.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b</xref> shows the results obtained after 2 hours of incubation in a severe PD cell line, compared with control fibroblasts. rhGAA is taken up efficiently by control fibroblasts, where rhGAA signal appears clustered in granular structures, which probably indicates correct delivery to the lysosomal compartment. In contrast, in severe PD fibroblasts the Alexa Fluor 546 signal is dispersed and less intense. Similar results were observed in cells incubated with fluorescent rhGAA for longer periods (4 and 8 hours) (data not shown).</p><p>Evidence of an impaired targeting of rhGAA to lysosomes was also obtained by western blot analysis of rhGAA maturation in PD cells. All cells were incubated with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml rhGAA, harvested and cell lysates subjected to western blot analysis. The amount of the single GAA molecular forms was quantitated by ImageJ analysis. In control fibroblasts the endogenous GAA was subtracted from the total amount detected after incubation with rhGAA. In severe and intermediate PD fibroblasts the amount of the enzyme internalized was reduced, confirming that GAA uptake is less efficient as compared with control fibroblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7c</xref> And <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7d</xref>). In addition, the processing of the enzyme was impaired in PD cells. Since the conversion of the 100 kDa to 95 kDa precursor GAA molecular forms into the mature 76 kDa enzyme takes place in the lysosomal compartment, these results indicate that the trafficking of rhGAA to lysosomes is abnormal in PD fibroblasts.</p><p>The studies on rhGAA uptake indicate that single rhGAA administrations are not equally efficient in correcting GAA deficiency in different PD fibroblasts, due to a derangement of the CI-MPR distribution, and contribute to the understanding of the variable response to ERT in different patients. However, it may be speculated that repeated administrations of rhGAA are more effective in correcting GAA activity and, possibly, the cellular phenotype in PD cells. We therefore studied the effects of a continuous supply of GAA in PD fibroblasts, extending the incubation time of PD fibroblasts with rhGAA for several days. To this purpose fibroblasts were incubated for 0 to 6 days and the medium containing 50 &#x003bc;g/ml rhGAA was refreshed every other day. Under these conditions GAA activity increased steadily and within 2 to 4 days approached normal or near-normal values in intermediate and juvenile PD cell lines. In cells from a patient with severe PD a complete correction of GAA activity required a longer incubation with rhGAA, and GAA activity showed a 'catch-up' increase between days 4 and 6, eventually reaching normal values (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8a</xref>). This suggests severely affected PD cells may be more difficult to treat and may require additional duration of therapy.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Correction of GAA activity in Pompe disease fibroblasts</bold>.

Scoring of CI-MPR distribution showed that the number of cells showing a reduced and/or mislocalized signal had decreased after treatment to approximately 44%, while in untreated cells cultured in parallel the rate of cells showing abnormal CI-MPR localization had remained unchanged (approximately 73%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8b</xref>). This indicates that ERT is effective in rescuing the cellular phenotype and that a normalization of the CI-MPR distribution is essential for correction of GAA activity. The rapid 'catch-up' increase of GAA activity observed in the severe cell line between 4 and 6 days is probably the consequence of a restored CI-MPR distribution and function.</p></sec><sec><title>The uptake of rhGAA is less efficient in fibroblasts from other LSDs</title><p>It is possible to speculate that a derangement of cellular functions and morphology, triggered by intralysosomal substrate storage, is a generalized phenomenon in LSDs.

It has been shown that fibroblasts, an <italic>in vitro </italic>system that can be obtained by procedures that cause only mild discomfort to patients, do accumulate glycogen and that GAA deficiency and glycogen storage correlates with age at onset and clinical course of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In PD fibroblasts we observed glycogen storage not only in lysosomes and in MVBs, but also in the cytoplasm. This may be a consequence of a reduced clearance of cytoplasmic glycogen by a less efficient autophagic machinery.</p><p>The autophagic compartment was in fact abnormal in PD fibroblasts, particularly in cells from severe and intermediate patients. Autophagy is a physiological catabolic pathway through which cytosolic proteins and organelles, such as mitochondria, are sequestered by double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes or autophagic vesicles) and degraded in the lysosomal compartment after autophagosome-lysosome fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. An impairment of autophagy has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of LSDs, with mechanisms that remain still partially understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>In PD, an age-dependent expansion of the autophagosomal compartment was observed in a PD knock-out mouse model obtained by disruption of the murine <italic>Gaa </italic>gene and in muscle biopsies from PD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These studies showed for the first time the presence of abnormal autophagy in PD tissues and correlated the presence of such abnormalities with a poor response to ERT, although the abnormalities of the autophagosomal compartment appeared to be confined to type II muscle cells. Our results add further information on the derangement of the autophagic pathway in PD as they indicate that abnormalities of autophagy are a generalized phenomenon in PD, detectable in cells other than specific muscle cells and that fibroblasts may represent a useful tool for <italic>in vitro </italic>studies aimed at investigating the mechanisms underlying these abnormalities.</p><p>We found abnormalities of Golgi and TGN morphology both by EM analysis and by immunofluorescence studies using known markers of these organelles. A large number of genes are involved in the correct organization of the Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and it might be an intriguing and challenging task to identify putative targets of glycogen storage among these genes and thus clarify the mechanisms leading to Golgi abnormalities in PD. In principle, an abnormal retrograde trafficking of membranes may play a role in disrupting the normal organization of the Golgi apparatus, as it has been shown that this mechanism is important in allowing the turnover of membranes and membrane-bound proteins and in maintaining the integrity of cellular organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The abnormalities of Golgi apparatus and the TGN may explain, at least in part, the changes in the distribution of CI-MPR, a membrane-bound protein mostly localized in Golgi and the TGN. CI-MPR traffics within cells following different itineraries in which transit to the TGN is an important stage, such as the lysosomal enzyme biosynthetic pathway, from the TGN to the late endosomes and back to the TGN; the endosomal pathway from the plasma membrane to the ERC, where most of it (84%, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]) recycles back to the plasma membrane; and an additional route that diverges from the endocytic pathway and reaches late endosomes and from these organelles carries CI-MPR again to the TGN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>The abnormal CI-MPR distribution observed in PD fibroblasts may be the result of a derangement in one or more of these pathways. We focused on the endocytic pathway, as this route is important for ERT. The rationale of ERT relies upon the demonstration that exogenous lysosomal enzymes are internalized through the interaction of mannose or mannose-6-phosphate ligands, present on the carbohydrate chains of the enzymes, with their specific receptors. An intact and efficient mannose-6-phosphate pathway is therefore essential for the efficacy of such therapeutic approach and it could reasonably be anticipated that an impaired trafficking of CI-MPR through the endocytic pathway may impact the efficiency of lysosomal enzyme uptake and thus the efficacy of ERT <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Time-lapse experiments using a severe PD cell line, showing the most striking abnormalities of cellular phenotype and of CI-MPR intracellular distribution, indicated that the route from the plasma membrane to the TGN is impaired. This may be the consequence of an abnormal retrograde trafficking of the CI-MPR from the late endosomes to the TGN. CI-MPR traffics together with Tf and TR, in the early endosomal compartment and in the ERC, where they recycle back to the plasma membrane. Since we did not find abnormalities of Tf and TR distribution in the PD cells examined, it is likely that the disruption of CI-MPR trafficking occurs at the late endosomal compartment and in the retrograde route to the TGN. In this respect it is worth mentioning that abnormal retrograde CI-MPR transport (such as due to inhibition of PACS1 and AP1), resulted in disruption of its normal localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>The finding of increased co-localization of CI-MPR with LC3, a marker of the autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes, supports the hypothesis of an impaired retrograde trafficking of CI-MPR from late endosomes to the TGN, and indicates that, at least in part, CI-MPR is sequestered in relatively inert vesicles deriving from the fusion of autophagosomes with substrate-engulfed lysosomes. Sequestration of CI-MPR in these organelles leads to a depletion of functionally available CI-MPR at the plasma membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of CI-MPR trafficking in the cells</bold>. CI-MPR follows different routes, including the biosynthetic pathway from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it binds and delivers newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases to the late endosomal compartment. A fraction (approximately 10%) of CI-MPR is located on the cell surface, where it mediates the uptake of lysosomal enzymes, is internalized in the endocytic pathway and recycles through the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC), again to the plasma membrane. The finding of increased co-localization of CI-MPR with LC3 in Pompe disease (PD) fibroblasts indicates that in these cells part of the CI-MPR is diverted from its normal routes and is sequestered in autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes. Since transferrin and transferring receptor trafficking is not affected in PD fibroblasts, it is likely that the disruption of CI-MPR trafficking occurs at the late endosomal compartment and in the retrograde route to the TGN.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1755-8417-1-6-10"/></fig><p>A consequence of the reduced availability of CI-MPR at the plasma membrane is that the uptake of exogenous enzymes is less efficient. Defective uptake of another lysosomal hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase, was demonstrated by Dhami and Schuchman in macrophages from a Niemann-Pick A mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The authors hypothesized that lipid accumulation in macrophages leads to abnormalities in CI-MPR trafficking and/or degradation, although they did not provide a morphological analysis of CI-MPR distribution and trafficking in their cell system supporting this hypothesis.</p><p>We showed that correction of GAA activity by rhGAA was impaired in individual PD cell lines. In principle, poor correction of GAA activity may result from impaired uptake or from reduced enzyme maturation and stability. The combination of the results of uptake studies of fluorescent-labelled enzyme and the results of western blot analysis of rhGAA processing indicates that both mechanisms contribute to a reduced efficacy of ERT in PD.</p><p>In our studies the rate of rhGAA uptake by PD fibroblasts varied among different cell lines and correlated with the degree of abnormality of CI-MPR distribution. We suggested that the abnormalities of CI-MPR distribution and GAA uptake correlate with disease severity, although other factors may also be implicated. The observation that cells from PD patients with the severe phenotypes are less efficient in internalizing rhGAA is apparently in contrast with the observation that the best results with ERT are obtained in patients with the infantile classic PD. In fact, in these patients treatment is started at an earlier age as compared with late-onset patients, and it is reasonable to think that if the abnormalities of cell functions are triggered by substrate storage, then the start of treatment before extensive storage occurs, particularly in the tissues which are the main targets of disease (cardiac and skeletal muscle), may prevent the development of these abnormalities.</p><p>The implications of our results for treatment with ERT in PD are evident. ERT has proved to be particularly challenging in a subset of PD patients, whereas in other patients the efficacy of ERT was excellent. The reasons for such a variable response to ERT are still controversial. Age at start of treatment is surely one of the most important factors for the outcome of ERT. In addition, other factors have been proposed. An effect due to the poor response of type II muscle fibres, initially suggested by Fukuda et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] was not confirmed by a subsequent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The role of other factors such as different genetic backgrounds and the different impacts of <italic>GAA </italic>gene mutations has not been fully investigated.</p><p>Our results identify the role of additional factors, such as the derangement of cellular functions and disruption of CI-MPR localization, implicated in the variable response to ERT.</p><p>ERT is based on weekly or biweekly infusions, depending on treatment protocols specific for each LSD. In PD, clinically detectable results are expected to be evident only after long-term treatments. An important question is whether correction of GAA deficiency by ERT may start a virtuous mechanism by correcting cellular abnormalities, restoring normal function of the CI-MPR pathway and, in turn, further improving the efficacy of rhGAA uptake. To address this question we incubated PD fibroblasts with rhGAA for long periods, up to 6 days. This resulted in increased GAA activity in all cell lines. However, correction was hampered in the cells with prominent abnormalities of CI-MPR distribution. In these cells a 'catch-up' increase, eventually leading to normal intracellular GAA activity, was observed in association with an improved CI-MPR cellular distribution.</p><p>This experiment provides useful information about ERT. First, it further supports the correlations between CI-MPR distribution and efficacy of ERT. In addition, our results support the idea that ERT may correct the abnormalities of cellular morphology and function. On the other hand, it should be mentioned that the experimental conditions we used, with relatively high rhGAA concentrations in the culture medium and continuous supply of new enzyme, differ from those used in human therapy. PD patients (as well as patients with other LSDs treatable with ERT) are treated with single rhGAA infusions every week or every other week and the concentrations attained in plasma return to baseline levels a few days after the infusion. Our results may therefore suggest that ERT treatment protocols should be reconsidered and that other approaches, such as gene therapy (providing a continuous supply of enzyme either locally or from 'factory' organs) may result in more effective rescuing of cell and tissue damage.</p><p>An intriguing question is whether the results obtained in PD fibroblasts indicate a mechanism shared by other LSDs, or are the result of the storage of a specific substrate. Although it was not in the scope of this study to provide a general model for all LSDs, we investigated whether rhGAA uptake is also affected in fibroblasts from patients with other LSDs. To this purpose we studied the uptake of rhGAA by MEFs from an animal model of MSD, generated by the disruption of the <italic>Sumf1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This model seems particularly suitable to address this point as in MSD the simultaneous deficiency of an entire family of lysosomal hydrolases causes substantial storage of a range of sulphated substrates. Also in these cells, and in fibroblasts from MPS II and VI, the uptake of rhGAA was less efficient as compared with controls. These observations are in favour of the hypothesis of a common abnormality in LSDs and indicate the need for similar studies, with the specific recombinant enzymes, in cell lines and animal models of other LSDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Recent studies have shown that in LSDs substrate storage triggers secondary events leading to abnormalities of cell morphology and function.
