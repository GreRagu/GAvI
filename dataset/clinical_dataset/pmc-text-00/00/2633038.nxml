In mouse embryo, long-term <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of cell behaviours and movements is difficult because of the development <italic>in utero</italic> and the impossibility of long-term culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We improved and combined two genetic methods of clonal analysis that together make practicable large-scale production of labelled clones. Using these methods we performed a clonal analysis of surface ectoderm (SE), a poorly understood structure, for a period that includes gastrulation and the establishment of the body plan. We show that SE formation starts with the definition at early gastrulation of a pool of founder cells that is already dorso-ventrally organized. This pool is then regionalized antero-posteriorly into three pools giving rise to head, trunk and tail. Each pool uses its own combination of cell rearrangements and mode of proliferation for elongation, despite a common clonal strategy that consists in disposing along the antero-posterior axis precursors of dorso-ventrally-oriented stripes of cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We propose that these series of morphogenetic processes are organized temporally and spatially in a posterior zone of the embryo crucial for elongation. The variety of cell behaviours used by SE precursor cells indicates that these precursors are not equivalent, regardless of a common clonal origin and a common clonal strategy. Another major result is the finding that there are founder cells that contribute only to the head and tail. This surprising observation together with others can be integrated with ideas about the origin of axial tissues in bilaterians.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In complex development, cells of the embryo are rearranged by cell movement and other cell behaviours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Rohde1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Keller1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> that shape the embryo and generate structures.

We report that SE, a simple 2D monolayer epithelial structure, shows non-random cell behaviours, namely that SE formation and elongation involve different combinations of cell rearrangement and modes of cell proliferation according to position along the axis. Our results suggest that the posterior zone in the embryo is crucial for SE elongation; cell proliferation and cell rearrangement are temporally and spatially organized in this zone. Another finding is that there is an early common pool of precursors restricted to the head and the posterior part of the embryo.

It contains 4248 E14.5 embryos. To validate the library, a sample of 97 embryos has been screened for determining the number of embryos lacking SE labelling. 42 (44&#x00025;) such negative embryos were found. From this number, the expected number of labellings corresponding to N recombination events (from 1 to 4) was calculated using the fluctuation test of Luria and Delbr&#x000fc;ck (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). 35 (36&#x00025;) embryos are expected to show clonal labelling (N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1); 15 (15&#x00025;), two recombination events (N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2) and only 4 (4&#x00025;), three recombination events (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004353-t001">Table 1</xref>, left column). Owing to the independent nature of the recombination events in both time and space, most of the double or triple recombination events correspond to situations readily recognizable by the size and spatial disposition of labelled clusters. Indeed most double events involve a small second clone and most non-clonally related clusters are scattered in SE. In addition these composite patterns are expected to be non-reproducible. We then applied these three criteria (size, spatial disposition and pattern non-reproducibility) to the description of the 97 embryos. The observed numbers of labelling possibly corresponding to N events (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004353-t001">Table 1</xref> right column) strikingly corresponded to those calculated using the fluctuation test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004353-t001">Table 1</xref> left column).

In GIFM, the aim is to induce genetic deletion in the highest number of cells at a given stage of development. In GICL the aim is to induce labelling in a single cell at a given stage of development. Here we report the first use of ubiquitous GICL to analyse SE, a large structure of the embryo.</p><p>Ubiquitous GICL presents four major specific constraints: 1) every single cell of the animal must express the recombinase, thus making possible the induction of clones in any structure and at any time during development; 2) the recombined reporter gene must be expressed in every descendant of the recombined cell, thus allowing the detection of labelled cell descendants at any selected stage of observation; to fulfil these two criteria, we used inducible ROSA26-driven Cre recombinases and a ROSA26 LacZ reporter gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Soriano1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>; 3) the conditional reporter line must be immune to spontaneous recombination that could activate the reporter gene in the absence of the Cre recombinase. ROSA26 LacZ reporter line (R26R) fulfils this criterion as no spontaneous recombination was ever found in R26R embryos and animals (E. Legu&#x000e9;, unpublished data); 4) ideally, the inducible Cre recombinase must have no activity in absence of the inducer molecule; in practice, the spontaneous activity of the inducible Cre recombinase must be low enough to allow the distinction between induced clonal labellings and background linked to spontaneous labellings. It appeared that the ROSA26cre-ER<sup>T</sup> line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Vooijs1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, that can be used to produce polyclonal labelling (see below), is improper for clonal labelling because of a significant level of spontaneous recombination. Another ROSA26 Cre line, CT2 (L. Grotewold and A. Smith, unpublished), in which a Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> gene has been introduced at the Nhe1 restriction site located 1 kb downstream of the usually used Xba1 restriction site, presents a frequency of spontaneous labelling compatible with the generation of a library of SE clones induced during gastrulation.

It is therefore not necessary to invoke recruitment from another source for any regions of the embryo including the late-formed structures; the pool of SE founder cells is probably a closed pool from an early stage of embryogenesis.</p><p>These analyses showed that each cell of the initial pool of SE founder cells produces large groups of P-DVCUs. These P-DVCUs are not randomly distributed in the embryo; they are arranged longitudinally and their contribution is DV restricted. The most dorsal part of the SE is under-represented relative to all other regions. If it is produced from founders that are restricted along their DV axis, like the other founders, the corresponding pool is smaller. The ancestral cells of the SE are not equipotent.

As the process of production proceeds in a rostral to caudal direction (see above), the modelling of the sequential mode of clonal growth for clones generated by random events (the LaacZ library) has been based on the functioning of a posterior pool. In a sequential mode, in which a posterior pool of precursor cells produces P-DVCUs during the establishment of the AP axis, long clones would be expected all contribute to the posterior pole of the embryo and clonal complexity (see terminology) would be expected to increase from anterior to posterior. Only small clones distributed homogenously along the axis of the embryo, and no intermediate-sized clones, would be expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g003">Fig. 3P</xref>). In a regional mode, the SE would form from the expansion of a few regions defined early. No clones contributing to the whole axis would be expected (the only long clones would be those derived from the ancestor cells) and clones would be intermediate-sized and smaller, and distributed homogenously along the AP axis. There would be no regions with greater clonal complexity than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g003">Fig. 3P</xref>&#x02032;, in which the SE would be formed from two regions).</p><p>The distributions and the sizes of the clones of the LaacZ library (Fig. 30) were assessed and classified according to their most-posterior limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g003">Fig. 3Q, R</xref>) which corresponds to the most stringent condition for discriminating between the two models. The distribution of the clones in the region from the anterior part of the forelimb to the anterior part of the hindlimb (regions 6 to 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) was consistent with a sequential mode of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g003">Fig. 3Q</xref>), this includes numerous long clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g003">Fig. 3Q</xref>, the 13 clones on the left) that contribute to the most posterior regions (regions 8 and 9) and many small clones distributed homogenously in the region. No intermediate-sized clone was observed. The distribution of clones in the head and neck (regions 1 to 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), however, was consistent with a regional mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g003">Fig. 3R</xref>): all clones were of intermediate size or smaller and were distributed homogenously in the region. All clones that contribute to all head-neck region result from labelling of the ancestor cells of this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g003">Fig. 3R</xref>, clones on the left).</p><p>These results suggest that two different modes of growth are used for the SE during AP elongation: a regional mode for the head-neck region and a sequential mode for the trunk, from a posterior pool. The boundaries between the regions, however, are not sharp. Some clones that contribute to the neck also contribute to the sequential production of the trunk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g003">Fig. 3Q</xref>, clones at left) and clones that contribute to the trunk can also contribute to the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g003">Fig. 3Q, 3</xref> clones at left); the intermediate regions may be produced by a mixture of both modes of growth.</p><p>These observations do not describe completely the relationship between the P-DVCUs.

A line was drawn, connecting the dorsal positions of the DVCUs of clones that have estimated birth dates between E6.5 and E7.5. We studied the 14 long LaacZ clones, the 27 most extensive clones in the E6.5 lox-LacZ library and 12 spontaneous clones in &#x0005b;CT2&#x000d7;R26R&#x0005d; embryos, all containing more than 400 cells.

The DVCUs have therefore been produced by the same single cell in the posterior pool (defined in the paragraph above): this cell would have kept a constant DV position during the period of AP dispersion. For another 14 of these 50 clones, two lines traced parallel to the longitudinal axis of the embryo, were required to account for the observed labelling: a major line that starts at the most anterior position and a secondary line that starts more posteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>, E&#x02032; red and magenta lines). It is likely that the cell at the origin of the secondary line was produced in the posterior pool by the cell at the origin of the major line (such that they are clonally related) and has shifted to a more ventral position in the posterior pool.

The cell in the posterior pool probably moved during the production of the P-DVCUs. For the remaining 5 of the 50 clones, the labelling exhibits successive and ordered shifts along the DV axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>); the cells of the clones show a strong tendency to shift from ventral to medial during AP dispersion (see below). In these last two cases, the shifts do not seem random and may correspond to defined DV regions of the embryo.</p><p>Thus, the labelling in the trunk reveals a clonal pattern, organised parallel to the AP axis of the embryo. The P-DVCUs produced by a single cell in the posterior pool contributes to the same longitudinal line.

We analyzed the DV positions adopted during AP dispersal of the 56 long lines of the clones with one or two longitudinal lines. The lines are found in only five DV positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g004">Fig. 4H</xref>, H&#x02032;). Twenty-four lines are in a dorsal position, lateral to the dorsal midline of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). This position dorsally limits a dorso-lateral region. Eleven lines are in a more lateral position that delimits a latero-medial region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>, magenta line). Nine lines characterize a more lateral position, the stripes being ventral to the limbs, limiting dorsally a mid-ventral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Five lines characterize a fourth position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), referred to as ventral, that limits dorsally a region that reaches the ventral midline. Seven lines characterize the last position: the middle of their DV stripes approximately coincides with the midline of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). This position is referred to as dorsal. Therefore the trunk is characterized by only five longitudinal sectors.</p><p>For the clones exhibiting two lines or shifts, the lines were always in adjacent positions, for instance dorso-lateral and latero-medial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>), or mid-ventral, latero-median and dorso-lateral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>).

Six of the 10 clones that have a short extension in the head also extend to the trunk, without change in their most DV position. Thus, 15 of the 25 clones show continuity of the most dorsal position of their DVCUs from the head to the trunk and therefore the regions defined in the trunk have a correspondence in the head.

However, the ventral region cannot be defined this way in the head: the ventral clones are genealogically closest to cells from more dorsal regions in the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004353-g005">Fig. 5H&#x02013;I</xref>, arrowheads).</p><p>Note that this correspondence between the trunk and the head only concerns the step of AP dispersal of P-DVCU, not their contribution to the different DV regions.

We used this system to generate polyclonal labelling and clonal labelling induced during gastrulation. The ability to generate polyclonal labelling allowed clonal saturation and therefore testing of the generality of the conclusions for any given structure. Polyclonal labelling can readily be generated using lines that present a moderate background of spontaneous recombination, as illustrated here with ROSA26cre-ER<sup>T</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Vooijs1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The ability to generate clonal labelling allows saturating critical periods of development. Clonal labelling requires a Cre recombinase that presents a low frequency of spontaneous labelling such as the CT2 line. The CT2 line made possible the generation of a saturated E6.5 lox-LacZ library, in a way that would have been impossible with the LaacZ system. It also allowed classification of the LaacZ clones generated in the period before, during and after the period covered by the lox-LacZ library. By saturating at E6.5 we could validate two families of clones, those that participate only in the head and the posterior part of the embryo and those that derive from cells set aside early in development that contribute to the formation of the posterior part of the embryo only. This observation is critical to interpret SE morphogenesis. However, the general use (that is not restricted to early stages) of the temporal system of clonal labelling is limited by the spontaneous generation of labelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Hayashi1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Kemp1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>; this article).

Therefore, it would seem particularly adapted to the growth of the SE whose main known property is to cover the embryo. Indeed, it is this simple mode of growth that is observed in the SE after E14, even if the final size and shape have not been attained. However, before E14, the SE does not grow in an isotropic mode. Between E14 and E9, growth is in dorso-ventrally oriented stripes and from E6.5 to about E9 growth is dispersive, along lines parallel to the longitudinal axis of the embryo with clonally related cells interspaced. It is the completion of the spacing of the P-DVCUs that defines the transition between the period of growth of the DVCUS and the period characterized by these lines. The succession of two sophisticated modes of growth demonstrates that SE formation is tightly organized and controlled. It suggests that these characteristics may have developmental origins.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>SE elongation by both cell rearrangement and cell proliferation</title><sec id="s3c1"><title>Spacing and mediolateral cell intercalation</title><p>The spacing of the clonally related P-DVCUs is characteristic of dispersive growth during the first phase of SE formation. Since, in addition, P-DVCUs are organized into a small number of sectors (manifest as the few discrete DV positions possible for the lines along which P-DVCUs are spaced), this implies a special cell rearrangement process. In the absence of cell rearrangement, clonally related cells would remain close, in columns or stripes, as they do later in the DV stripes and as other cells do in other systems (the clonal columns in the cortical structures of the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Luskin1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Kornack1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and the longitudinal columns of the tubular structure of the kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Fischer1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Jung1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

It must separate daughter cells without changing their relative DV position. As this ordered process involves several adjacent sectors, it must act throughout the DV dimension of the structure. In the trunk and the tail the spacing is stronger dorsally than ventrally, suggesting that the process involved is oriented towards the midline.</p><p>An obvious consequence of this spacing is elongation of the head, trunk and tail SE.

So the most obvious explanation for the spacing of the clonally related P-DVCUs of the SE, their organization in lines parallel to the AP axis and the DV sectorisation, is convergent extension, a hypothesis that can now be tested.</p><p>Several observations suggest that the process at the origin of the spacing of P-DVCUS follows a spatio-temporal progression from anterior to posterior. The smallest clones induced at E6.5&#x02013;E7.5 in the head have only one or two P-DVCUs although those in the trunk or the tail have numerous P-DVCUs indicating that the spacing stopped in the head at a stage when it is still operating in the trunk and the tail. This suggests a caudally oriented progression of the initiation of the spacing.</p><p>We conclude that the spacing of the PUCDVs is very likely the consequence of medio-lateral convergent extension of the SE. As the SE of the posterior territories (the tail) is organized into sectors and shows similar spacing, convergent extension continue even after the regression of the primitive streak and the closure of the neuropore.</p></sec><sec id="s3c2"><title>Combination of distinct modes of cell proliferation with spacing</title><p>The analysis of the mode of growth of the cells producing the P-DVCUs suggests a sequential mode in the trunk: production from a pool of caudally positioned cells that self renews during the process and produces the P-DVCUs anteriorly. The caudally polarized clones that start in the middle of the trunk, in the E6.5 lox-LacZ library, indicate that this system produces the P-DVCUs for the anterior trunk by E7.5. However, as no clones corresponding to only one P-DVCU were found in the anterior trunk, spacing is not yet started. Consequently production and spacing of the P-DVCUs are likely two separate and sequential operations. Both progress from anterior to posterior.</p><p>In the head, the production of the P-DVCUs is regional. If the spacing of the cells in the head uses the same cellular operations as in the trunk these operations could be combined with different modes of division, suggesting a modular organisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Raff1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Schlosser1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> of these operations.

This DV organization is established very early: clones from the ancestral and founder cells of SE already exhibit a DV restriction. This organization is maintained during the elongation of the head and of the trunk, as demonstrated by most clones having only one line parallel to the AP axis of the embryo in each of these structures. This striking observation shows that the process of elongation is not accompanied by random cell mixing along the DV axis, but respects some sort of coherence. This coherence could be part of the process of oriented AP elongation and/or preliminary DV organization.</p><p>Many lines continue unchanged in the head and the trunk and in particular in the more dorsal regions, revealing a continuity of properties. This is accompanied by a clonal continuity between the pools of cells that produce the head and the trunk: indeed, the pool that produces the trunk P-DVCUs is probably entirely derived from cells that have produced head P-DVCUs.</p><p>Nevertheless neither the clonal nor the cellular organization is totally conserved. First, not all cells of the head contribute to the trunk pool, but mainly the dorsal and dorso-lateral ones. Second, many of these cells move ventrally (the so called shifts). These indicate that there is a transition involving cell rearrangement and the acquisition of novel properties (such as a change in the fluidity of the tissue). This transition requiring a change in the developmental programmes of the cells occurs at the level of the rhombencephalon, that is, before the production of the anterior trunk. It may be as early as the initiation of gastrulation, raising the possibility that the trunk pool is organized by signals from the anterior primitive streak. The transition may accompany the individualization of the trunk organizer from a structure that contains the anterior organizer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Beddington1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and controls early SE development in the head. This would require novel programming of the precursor cells of the SE (acquisition of a novel mode of growth and for a short period of time, novel dispersal behaviour). It should be noted that the transition occurs in a context of a closed SE pool: all cells that contribute to the trunk SE are cells that have previously produced SE. Clearly, clonal continuity in this case does not mean continuity of cell properties. The precursor cells of a structure can change.</p><p>Whether these changes occur in concert with the evolution of other long-term axial progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Nicolas1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Mathis3">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Cambray1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Cambray2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Wilson1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Psychoyos1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004353-Selleck1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> in particular neural progenitors with which SE progenitors share many properties, can now be experimentally tested.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Dorso-ventrally oriented stripes</title><p>The DV oriented stripes of cells are a general characteristic of the growth of the head, the trunk and the tail SE.

Surprisingly, these two specific pools have (at least in part) the same clonal origin as evidenced by clones that contribute only to the head and the tail.
