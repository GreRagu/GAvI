This is particularly astonishing given the ongoing controversy concerning its phylogenetic position. In order to contribute new morphogenetic data for phylogenetic and evolutionary inferences, we describe herein the ontogeny and myoanatomy of larvae and adults of the rhynchonelliform brachiopods <italic>Argyrotheca cordata, A. cistellula</italic>, and <italic>Terebratalia transversa </italic>using fluorescence F-actin labelling combined with confocal laserscanning microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Fully grown larvae of <italic>A. cordata </italic>and <italic>T. transversa </italic>consist of three distinct body regions, namely an apical lobe, a mantle lobe with four bundles of setae, and a pedicle lobe. Myogenesis is very similar in these two species. The first anlagen of the musculature develop in the pedicle lobe, followed by setae muscles and the mantle lobe musculature. Late-stage larvae show a network of strong pedicle muscles, central mantle muscles, longitudinal muscles running from the mantle to the pedicle lobe, setae pouch muscles, setae muscles, a U-shaped muscle, serial mantle muscles, and apical longitudinal as well as apical transversal muscles. Fully developed <italic>A. cistellula </italic>larvae differ from the former species in that they have only two visible body lobes and lack setae. Nevertheless, we found corresponding muscle systems to all muscles present in the former two species, except for the musculature associated with the setae, in larvae of <italic>A. cistellula</italic>. With our survey of the adult myoanatomy of <italic>A. cordata </italic>and <italic>A. cistellula </italic>and the juvenile muscular architecture of <italic>T. transversa </italic>we confirm the presence of adductors, diductors, dorsal and ventral pedicle adjustors, mantle margin muscles, a distinct musculature of the intestine, and striated muscle fibres in the tentacles for all three species.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data indicate that larvae of rhynchonelliform brachiopods share a common muscular bodyplan and are thus derived from a common ancestral larval type. Comparison of the muscular phenotype of rhynchonelliform larvae to that of the other two lophophorate phyla, Phoronida and Ectoprocta, does not indicate homology of individual larval muscles. This may be due to an early evolutionary split of the ontogenetic pathways of Brachiopoda, Phoronida, and Ectoprocta that gave rise to the morphological diversity of these phyla.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Brachiopoda is a small lophophorate phylum with a prominent fossil record since the Lower Cambrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. More than 12.000 fossil and approximately 380 recent species are known to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The phylum is commonly divided into three taxa, the articulate Rhynchonelliformea and the two inarticulate clades Craniiformea and Linguliformea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and has traditionally been grouped together with Phoronida and Ectoprocta into the superphylum Lophophorata. However, this classification has recently been challenged by paleontological and molecular datasets. While some analyses employing morphological data assign Brachiopoda to Deuterostomia [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]], recent molecular data either propose sistergroup relationships to various spiralian phyla including Mollusca, Annelida, and Nemertea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], or support the notion that Phoronida are an ingroup of Brachiopoda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Apart from some mainly gross morphological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], detailed data using modern techniques such as fluorescence labelling and confocal laserscanning microscopy are not yet available. This is especially true with respect to the development of the musculature, despite the fact that myo-anatomical features may provide useful characters for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Recently, some data on larval muscle development for the proposed brachiopod sister groups Phoronida and Ectoprocta have become available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Accordingly, larval myogenesis in Brachiopoda constitutes an important gap of knowledge in comparative developmental studies on Lophophorata. With the first thorough, comparative account of brachiopod larval myogenesis provided herein for the rhynchonelliform species <italic>Argyrotheca cordata </italic>(Risso, 1826), <italic>Argyrotheca cistellula </italic>(Searles-Wood, 1841), and <italic>Terebratalia transversa </italic>(Sowerby, 1846), we aim at stimulating the discussion concerning lophophorate bodyplan evolution, phylogeny, and development. Furthermore, we contribute to questions concerning the muscular ground pattern of rhynchonelliform brachiopod larvae. We supplement our ontogenetic data with a detailed description of the adult muscle systems of all three species.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Embryonic and larval development of <italic>Argyrotheca cordata</italic></title><p>Embryos and larvae of <italic>Argyrotheca cordata </italic>are brooded by the mother animal and are released as late-stage larvae competent to undergo metamorphosis. Accordingly, larval development is entirely lecithotrophic. After cleavage and gastrulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), a three-lobed larva is established, which comprises an anterior apical lobe, a mantle lobe in the mid-body region, and a posterior pedicle lobe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B&#x02013;F</xref>). In very early three-lobed stages, the blastopore is visible at the base of the apical lobe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This larval mouth closes during subsequent larval development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Scanning electron micrographs of the embryonic and larval development of <italic>Argyrotheca cordata</italic></bold>.

In older larvae with short setae (corresponding to the stage shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), setae muscles start to develop. These run from the setal pouches in anterior direction and connect to the apical longitudinal muscles at the border between apical and mantle lobe (lateral setae muscles) or to the central mantle muscles (dorsal setae muscles), respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The apical longitudinal muscles extend laterally within the apical lobe and terminate anteriorly at an apical transversal muscle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). At this stage, longitudinal muscles are also found within the pedicle lobe. From there, they run into the mantle lobe, where they connect to longitudinal muscles which originate at the muscle interconnection point at the border between apical and mantle lobe. The larval gut rudiment is visible as a tube in the centre of the larvae (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><p>In fully developed larvae, setae pouch muscles are established and interconnected by a circular mantle muscle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). From this circular mantle muscle emerge serial mantle muscles, which are dorsolaterally closed by the central mantle muscles. The central mantle muscles are connected to the dorsal setae muscles and to the apical longitudinal muscles at the border of the apical and the mantle lobe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E&#x02013;F</xref>). Anteroventrally, the serial mantle muscles are enclosed by a U-shaped muscle which extends ventrally from the pedicle muscles towards the circular mantle muscle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D&#x02013;F</xref>; see also additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The primordial hump is devoid of any musculature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E&#x02013;F</xref>).</p><p>Adult <italic>A. cordata </italic>studied were 0.8&#x02013;1.3 mm wide and 0.9&#x02013;1.4 mm long. We can confirm four pairs of muscles which have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These are one pair of adductors and one pair of diductors, which attach to both the dorsal and to the ventral valve. In addition, there are two pairs of pedicle adjustors, one of which being attached to the ventral valve and the pedicle, and one being attached to the dorsal valve and the pedicle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;B</xref>). In addition, we found a distinct musculature in the tentacles of the lophophore and in the digestive system. Each tentacle contains several bands of striated muscle fibers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D&#x02013;E</xref>), while the stomach and intestine are each lined by numerous delicate ring muscles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Moreover, minute muscles are distributed along the dorsal and ventral mantle margin, which probably function as mantle retractor muscles. These mantle retractors are abundant and are oriented perpendicularly to the mantle margin that lines the shell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Adult myoanatomy of <italic>Argyrotheca cordata</italic></bold>.

Thus, the fully developed larvae have only two visible lobes, namely the apical and the mantle lobe. The investigated larvae were around 117&#x02013;139 &#x003bc;m long and 78&#x02013;104 &#x003bc;m wide. The first muscles appear in larvae with all lobes fully differentiated. These are two dorsal mantle muscles which extend dorsally from anterior to posterior in the mantle lobe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Parallel and further lateral to these dorsal mantle muscles run the early lateral mantle muscles, and the first rudiments of the serial mantle muscles arise at this stage in the mantle lobe. These develop subsequently into a network of muscles that extends dorsally and ventrally from the two lateral mantle muscles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;F</xref>). These lateral mantle muscles connect to the apical longitudinal muscles at the anterior pole and to the posterior muscle ring at the posterior pole of the larvae (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B&#x02013;F</xref>). During subsequent development, the ventral mantle muscles and the pedicle muscles emerge (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The pedicle muscles, situated in the centre of the mantle lobe, are the most prominent muscles in fully grown larvae (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). They connect to the apical longitudinal muscles, which in turn are in contact with the apical transversal muscles. The latter form a muscle ring in the apical lobe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E&#x02013;F</xref>). The musculature of fully developed larvae includes the pedicle muscles, which are connected to the apical longitudinal muscles, the ventral mantle muscles, and the dorsal mantle muscles that connect to the pedicle muscles. Furthermore, serial mantle muscles, which extend dorsally and ventrally from the lateral mantle muscles, are present. Ventrally, the serial mantle muscles terminate at the ventral mantle muscles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Myogenesis in <italic>Argyrotheca cistellula</italic></bold>.

As such, the setae pouch muscles, the setae muscles, and the longitudinal muscles, which run from the mantle lobe to the pedicle lobe, are only present in <italic>A. cordata </italic>and <italic>T. transversa</italic>, while the lateral mantle muscles are only present in larvae of <italic>A. cistellula</italic>. These differences between <italic>A. cistellula </italic>on the one hand and <italic>A. cordata </italic>and <italic>T. transversa </italic>on the other correspond to the gross morphological observation that <italic>A. cistellula </italic>lacks setae.</p><p>Larval setae in brachiopods have been proposed to function as a defence device and to control buoyancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The setae of <italic>A. cistellula </italic>larvae have probably been secondarily lost, as these larvae are brooded and may settle shortly after release from the mother animal. However, <italic>A. cordata </italic>larvae have retained their setae despite being brooded, which may hint towards an extended planktonic period of these larvae.</p><p>The muscles in the pedicle lobe have been proposed earlier to be of functional use during metamorphosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. When larvae settle, a glandular region at the tip of the primordial hump functions as site of attachment to the substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Subsequently, the primordial hump forms the first rudiment of the juvenile pedicle. After larval settlement, the mantle lobe is inverted over the apical lobe and eventually forms the juvenile mantle. The apical lobe gets enclosed by the valves and forms the lophophore and all anterior adult structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. At the onset of metamorphosis, the U-shaped muscle may, due to its connection to the pedicle muscles and the circular mantle muscle, aid in inverting the mantle lobe. During metamorphosis, the larval pedicle muscles are still present at the time of ventral pedicle adjustor and diductor formation. However, whether the larval pedicle muscles are resorbed or are (partly) incorporated into the juvenile diductor and/or pedal adjustor muscles could not be clarified by the present study.</p><p><italic>Argyrotheca cordata </italic>is the sole species from this study for which data on the larval myoanatomy had previously been available. In the first descriptions from 1873 and 1883, "muscles abdominaux", that run from the pedicle lobe into the mantle lobe, had been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. A different description was given slightly later, when a network of muscles in the fully developed larva was described. The muscles were denoted "Muskel des lateralen Borstenb&#x000fc;ndels", "Muskel des medialen Borstenb&#x000fc;ndels", "musculus contractor", "musculus rotator dorsalis", and "musculus abductor" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our findings confirm the results of the first papers with respect to the pedicle muscles and the setae muscles. However, in our specimens, the pedicle muscles were not directly connected to the setae muscles as depicted in the first descriptions, but were instead connected to the U-shaped muscle.</p><p>In adult <italic>Argyrotheca cordata</italic>, four pairs of muscles had been identified previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The pair of adductor muscles has two insertion sites, one anterior to the other at the dorsal valve, and an additional one at the ventral valve. The pair of diductor muscles inserts at the posterior part of both the ventral and the dorsal valve. One of the two pairs of adjustors inserts at the ventral valve and the pedicle, while the other pair inserts at the dorsal valve and the pedicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The muscular systems of adult <italic>A. cordata </italic>and <italic>A. cistellula </italic>are similar to each other and comprise one pair of adductors, two pairs of pedicle adjustors and one pair of diductors. The tentacles contain several fibres of striated musculature which have previously been described as "rows of striated fusiform myoepithelial cells" in the lophophore of <italic>T. transversa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>For the juvenile musculature of <italic>Terebratalia transversa </italic>we followed the nomenclature used by Eshleman and Wilkens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The juvenile musculature, five days after metamorphosis, comprises rudiments of the tentacle muscles, rudiments of the mantle margin musculature, one pair of adductors, one pair of diductors, one pair of dorsal, and one pair of ventral pedicle adjustors. The ventral pedicle adjustors are connected to the diductors in the juvenile.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparative myogenesis of Lophophorata</title><p>For the Phoronida, data on muscle development are currently available for three species, namely <italic>Phoronis pallida, P. harmeri</italic>, and <italic>P. architecta </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The larvae of these species are of the actinotroch-type and differ considerably from brachiopod larvae in both their gross anatomy and in their lifestyle, because these phoronid larvae are planktotrophic, while the brachiopod larvae investigated herein are of the typical three-lobed, lecithotrophic type. Accordingly, a considerable part of the larval phoronid musculature is linked to the digestive system (e.g., the oesophageal ring muscles) and to the maintenance of a cylindrical body shape (e.g., a meshwork of circular and longitudinal muscles in the bodywall). In addition, trunk retractor muscles, that originate from the posterior collar ring muscles and insert in the telotrochal region, are present in phoronid larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The collar region contains mainly ring muscles and few longitudinal muscles. The subumbrellar and exumbrellar layers of the hood contain circular muscles and a series of longitudinal muscles, which, in the exumbrellar layer, function as hood elevators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, the tentacles of phoronid actinotroch larvae contain elevator and depressor muscles which consist of two loops in the elevators and a single loop in the depressors. These tentacle muscles are interconnected by the ring muscle of the collar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We did not identify any muscles in the larvae of the three brachiopod species described herein that could potentially correspond to the actinotroch muscle systems known so far.</p><p>The muscular architecture in ectoproct larvae is very diverse, thus following the high plasticity of larval gross morphology and the notion that lecithotrophic larvae might have evolved up to six times within Ectoprocta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. To date, the larval muscular systems have been described for <italic>Membranipora membranacea </italic>(cyphonautes larva), <italic>Flustrellidra hispida </italic>(pseudocyphonautes larva), <italic>Celleporaria sherryae </italic>and <italic>Schizoporella floridana </italic>(both coronate larva), <italic>Bowerbankia gracilis </italic>(vesiculariform larva), <italic>Bugula stolonium </italic>and <italic>B. fulva </italic>(both buguliform larva), <italic>Sundanella sibogae, Nolella stipata, Amathia vidovici, Aeverrillia setigera</italic>, and <italic>Alcyonidium gelatinosum </italic>(all ctenostome larva), and <italic>Crisia elongata </italic>(cyclostome larva) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recently, a number of homologies have been proposed for various larval ectoproct muscle systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These are the coronal ring muscle, which underlies the ciliated, ring-shaped swimming organ of most larval types, the anterior median muscle, which runs anteriorly from ventral to dorsal in most species, lateral muscles, which project laterally in dorso-ventral direction in most larvae, longitudinal muscles along the posterior body axis, and transversal muscles, which are situated transversally in the central body region of <italic>F. hispida</italic>, <italic>M. membranacea</italic>, and <italic>A. gelatinosum</italic>. Besides these proposed homologous muscles, each larval type shows unique muscles in the body wall and/or inside the larval body, reflecting at least partly the functional adaptations to a planktotrophic <italic>versus </italic>a lecithotrophic lifestyle. No muscles corresponding to any of the ectoproct muscle types were found in the brachiopod species investigated in this study (and noticeably no homologous muscles between the lecithotrophic ectoproct and brachiopod larval types could be identified), again demonstrating the high plasticity of lophophorate larval anatomy.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>All rhynchonelliform brachiopod larvae studied to date are three-lobed with four bundles of setae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], except for the larva of <italic>Argyrotheca cistellula</italic>, which is externally bilobed and lacks setae, and the three-lobed thecideid larvae, which likewise lack setae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Despite these gross morphological differences, myogenesis in the three brachiopod species investigated is very similar. Thus, we propose a larval muscular groundpattern for rhynchonelliform brachiopods comprising apical longitudinal muscles, apical transversal muscles, circular mantle muscles, central mantle muscles, longitudinal muscles, serial mantle muscles, pedicle muscles, setae pouch muscles, setae muscles, and a U-shaped muscle. However, a final statement can only be made once data on the musculature of theceid and rhynchonellid larvae become available.</p><p>Comparing this proposed larval muscular groundpattern to the hitherto investigated phoronids, ectoprocts, and spiralian taxa such as polychaetes, molluscs, plathelminths or entoprocts does not reveal any homologies of larval brachiopod muscles and the muscles of other lophotrochozoan larvae, regardless of whether the respective larvae are lecithotrophic or planktotrophic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. From these data we conclude that the ontogenetic pathways of the individual lophophorate phyla have split early in evolution from that of other Lophotrochozoa, which then resulted in the wide morphological diversity of larval and adult lophophorate bodyplans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal collection and fixation</title><sec><title><italic>Argyrotheca cordata </italic>and <italic>A. cistellula</italic></title><p>Adults were obtained from encrusting coralline red algae (corallig&#x000e8;ne), which was collected in the vicinity of the Observatoire Oc&#x000e9;anologique de Banyuls-sur-mer, France (42&#x000b0;29'27.51" N; 3&#x000b0;08'07.67" E), by SCUBA from 30&#x02013;40 m depth in July 2002 and June 2007.
