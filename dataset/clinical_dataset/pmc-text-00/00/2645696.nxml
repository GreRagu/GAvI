Therefore, Vav<sup>NULL</sup> mice provided us with a unique tool to interrogate the importance of ITAM-dependent signals in neutrophil motility, as Vav<sup>NULL</sup> neutrophils show a nearly complete block in ITAM signaling, but can still undergo integrin activation via inside-out signaling and undergo chemotaxis in response to chemotactic gradients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004652-Gakidis1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To determine if Vav-dependent ITAM signals are required for neutrophil motility, we developed a competitive assay in which Vav<sup>NULL</sup> neutrophils were analyzed <italic>in vivo</italic> side-by-side with wild type (WT) neutrophils. WT recipient mice were infected with LM, and 2 hours later, equal numbers of fluorescently labeled WT and Vav<sup>NULL</sup> neutrophils were adoptively transferred. Mice were injected i.v. with high molecular weight rhodamine-dextran to visualize blood vessels and to distinguish neutrophils in the blood from extravasated neutrophils. In response to LM infection, adoptively transferred WT neutrophils showed similar extravasation and migration behaviors as compared to endogenous neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004652-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004652-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) validating this approach.

Moreover, Vav<sup>NULL</sup> neutrophils showed a strong directional bias in their migration, similar to WT cells, suggesting that the chemotactic response induced by LM infection is not disrupted by Vav deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004652-g002">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004652.s002">Movie S2</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined migration of Vav<sup>NULL</sup> neutrophils by measuring several motility parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004652-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

Strikingly, Vav<sup>NULL</sup> neutrophils had significantly reduced interstitial transit rates compared to WT neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004652-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Moreover, when compared on a per track basis, Vav<sup>NULL</sup> neutrophils exhibited a 35&#x00025; reduction in median velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004652-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). While the velocity of Vav<sup>NULL</sup> neutrophils was substantially impaired, their migration remained highly directional, as measured by the meandering index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004652-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). Both meandering index and turning angle distribution were similar between WT and Vav<sup>NULL</sup> neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004652-g002">Fig. 2F</xref> and data not shown) as well as in WT Lys-GFP neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004652-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Thus, these data show that Vav GEFs play a novel role in regulating the interstitial velocity of neutrophils, but they are not required for maintaining the direction of migration during chemotaxis. To determine if the observed defect in velocity was associated with abnormal cell polarity, we measured the shape index (length/width ratio) of neutrophils during migration. Vav<sup>NULL</sup> neutrophils were significantly less elongated as compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004652-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>), consistent with the requirement for Vav in amoeboid motility.</p><p>The observation that Vav<sup>NULL</sup> neutrophils exhibit defects in velocity <italic>in vivo</italic> contrasts with our observation <italic>in vitro</italic> that Vav<sup>NULL</sup> neutrophils show no reduction in velocity over two-dimensional substrates in response to chemotactic factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004652-Gakidis1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast to haptokinetic motility <italic>in vitro</italic>, motility in three dimensions <italic>in vivo</italic> shows a clear requirement for Vav proteins and implicates ITAM signaling in the control of interstitial trafficking. In this context, Vav proteins have previously been shown to play essential roles as antigen and DAP12/FcR&#x003b3; receptor-proximal phospho-tyrosine adaptors. Thus, along with SLP76, Grb2, and Syk, Vav proteins constitute a critical component of the ITAM signalosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004652-Miletic1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004652-Abram1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004652-Bezman1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Additionally, blood vessels were visualized by retro-orbital injection of dextran tetramethylrhodamine (2,000,000 MW). Immediately following injection of neutrophils and dextran, mice were anesthetized and secured to a warming plate on the microscope stage for imaging of inflammation in the footpad.
