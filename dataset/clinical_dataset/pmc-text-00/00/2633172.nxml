We report here the use of a naive cyclic peptide phage display library to identify peptide ligands able to recognize and mimic IgG1-Fc functions with Fc&#x003b3;RI. Selection by competing off binders to Fc&#x003b3;RI with IgG1 allowed the isolation of a family of peptides sharing the common consensus sequence TX<sub>2</sub>CXX&#x003b8;PXLLGC&#x003a6;XE (&#x003b8; represents a hydrophobic residue, &#x003a6; is usually an acidic residue, and X is any residue) and able to inhibit IgG1 binding to Fc&#x003b3;RI. In soluble form, these peptides antagonize superoxide generation mediated by IgG1. In complexed form, they trigger phagocytosis and a superoxide burst. Unlike IgG, these peptides are strictly Fc&#x003b3;RI-specific among the Fc&#x003b3;Rs. Molecular modeling studies suggest that these peptides can adopt 2 distinct and complementary conformers, each able to mimic the discontinuous interface contacts constituted by the C&#x003b3;2-A and -B chains of Fc for Fc&#x003b3;RI. In addition, by covalent homodimerization, we engineered a synthetic bivalent 37-mer peptide that retains the ability to trigger effector functions. We demonstrate here that it is feasible to maintain IgG-Fc function within a small structured peptide. These peptides represent a new format for modulation of effector functions.&#x02014;Bonetto, S., Spadola, L., Buchanan, A. G., Jermutus, L. Lund, J.

Although binding sites on enzyme surfaces and small ligand binding sites on receptor surfaces typically consist of a concave cleft shape, extracellular protein-protein interactions often involve large and relatively flat contact surfaces, lacking deep cavities and pockets that might provide compact binding sites for small molecules <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">(1</xref><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">, 2)</xref>. However, it may not be necessary for a small ligand to cover the entire protein-binding interface. Of these many intermolecular contacts, a very limited number of residues, clustered in a centralized region, may account for up to 85% of the free energy of binding, hence contributing predominantly to the generation of high-affinity interactions <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">(3)</xref>. Many proteins are recognized by multiple partners. An important point is that these proteins tend to use the same binding &#x0201c;hot spots,&#x0201d; which are recognized in specific spatial orientations. Although in theory, potential ligands could bind to a protein anywhere on its solvent-exposed surface, most peptides recognize localized sites that appear to coincide with natural ligand binding sites, and consequently can function as agonists or antagonists <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">(4)</xref>. So, if proteins generally interact through compact functional epitopes, the task of identifying and designing small ligands may be achievable.</p><p>Since construction of a peptide phage library was described initially <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">(5)</xref>, over 1000 articles related to this strategy have been reported. Phage display libraries are commonly used to identify small ligands able to mimic natural binding partners with desired functional properties <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">(6)</xref>.</p><p>We used this technology to isolate cyclic peptides able to target the IgG-Fc (immunoglobulin G-fragment crystallizable) binding site on human Fc&#x003b3;RI and mimic human IgG1 triggering of function. IgG antibodies are the predominant isotype in serum and interstitial fluids and are the format used almost exclusively for therapeutic antibodies. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis, and superoxide generation are mediated through interaction of ICs (immune complexes) with Fc&#x003b3;Rs expressed on the surface of leukocytes, whereas CDC (complement-dependent cytotoxicity) occurs by interaction of ICs with the soluble complement system. Among the three classes of Fc&#x003b3; receptor, Fc&#x003b3;RI is a &#x0201c;high-affinity&#x0201d; receptor that interacts with monomeric, as well as complexed, human IgG1 or IgG3 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">(7)</xref>. The physiological role of Fc&#x003b3;RI is unclear, not least because Fc&#x003b3;RI is always present in combination with other receptor classes. In order to signal, Fc receptors need to be colocated at the cell surface <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">(8)</xref>. Understanding the molecular basis of the Fc&#x003b3;RI-Fc interaction has been the subject of detailed investigations largely based on comparative binding <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">(9)</xref>, activity studies of chimeric IgG <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">(10)</xref>, Ig-Fc modified by site-directed mutagenesis <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">(11)</xref>, and Fc peptide fragments <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">(12)</xref>.

To our knowledge, these are the first peptides able to antagonize effector functions mediated by Fc&#x003b3;RI. Furthermore, we engineered a 37-residue single-chain homodimer peptide able to trigger a superoxide burst in a monocyte-like cell line. Therefore, we show that dimerization of monomeric Fc-mimetic peptides is sufficient to colocate Fc&#x003b3;RI on the cell surface. The results bring new molecular and structural insights to bear on the mechanism of IgG-receptor interaction and Fc&#x003b3;R colocation, and above all show that it is feasible to engineer a miniature Fc-like format able to mimic IgG-Fc mediation of effector function. These peptides may constitute the basis for the design of small ligands for the therapeutic treatment of cancer and inflammatory disorders, and suggest new opportunities for engineered antibodies.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning procedures, construction libraries, and phage library synthesis</title><p>Three cyclic phage-peptide libraries, X<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>10</sub>CX<sub>2</sub>, X<sub>3</sub>CX<sub>8</sub>CX<sub>3</sub>, and X<sub>5</sub>CX<sub>4</sub>X<sub>5</sub>, were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">(22)</xref> using 3 oligonucleotides, 5&#x02032;-GCTAAACAACTTTCAACAGTTTCTGCGGCCGC(SNN)<sub>2</sub>ACA(SNN)<sub>10</sub>ACA(SNN)<sub>2</sub>CTGTGCACTGTGAGAATAGAAGG-3&#x02032;; 5&#x02032;-GCTAAACAACTTTCAACAGTTTCTGCGGCCGC(SNN)<sub>3</sub>ACA(SNN)<sub>8</sub>ACA(SNN)<sub>3</sub>CTGTGCACTGTGAGAATAGAAGG-3&#x02032;; and 5&#x02032;-GCTAAACAACTTTCAACAGTTTCTGCGGCCGC(SNN)<sub>5</sub>ACA(SNN)<sub>4</sub>ACA(SNN)<sub>5</sub>CTGTGCACTGTGAGAATAGAAGG-3&#x02032;, where <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; T, C, G, or A, and S &#x0003d; G or C, as described previously <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">(23)</xref>.

The plates were blocked at each selection round with 0.3 nM Fc&#x003b3;RI, supplemented alternatively with either 4% (w/v) powdered milk/0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> or 0.5% BSA (w/v)/0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C.

Biotinylation efficiency was ascertained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis (Ciphergen Biosystems Ltd, Guilford, UK). The reaction was stopped by gel filtration over a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and the biotinylated protein concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at 280 nm (&#x003b5;<sub>280</sub>&#x0003d;1.4 mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Peptide synthesis and dimerization</title><p>Synthetic 18-mer peptides were produced in 1&#x02013;3 mg amounts and characterized by analytical HPLC and LC/MS (Pepscan Systems, Lelytad, The Netherlands). Peptides were synthesized with a free N terminus and a biotinylated C terminus in the general form NH<sub>2</sub>-AQX<sub>3</sub>CX<sub>8</sub>CX<sub>3</sub>K-biot in an oxidized state. Cyclic hinge-C<sub>H</sub>2 peptide (sequence AQTAPCAPA PELLGCPSV) corresponding to the cyclic hinge sequence of native IgG1 constructed according to the format for cyclic octa-peptides, and peptide 22 (peptide 22 S<sub>4</sub>S<sub>13</sub>) with Ser substitutions replacing both Cys residues were also synthesized as described previously. The single-chain dimeric peptides were synthesized and produced in 10-mg amounts (AMS Biotechnology, Oxon, England) using a standard solid-phase peptide synthesis on Wang resin with fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) -protected amino acids. Briefly, homodimer peptides were synthesized as linear dimers, trityl (Trt) was used as a side-chain protecting group for the first pair of Cys residues on the first monomer, and S-acetamidomethyl aminoacetal (Acm) as a side-chain protecting group for the second pair of Cys residues on the second monomer. The resin and the protecting Trt groups were then cleaved by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis was used to confirm the correct structure of the peptide with Cys (Acm) intact. The unprotected Cys residues were air oxidized to form the first intramolecular disulfide bridge, and then purified by HPLC to achieve separation of high purity peptide containing the disulfide bridge. The correct mass was verified by ESI-MS analysis and lyophilized. The second intramolecular disulfide bridge was formed using iodine, which also directly removes the Acm protection group from the Cys side chain. After ESI-MS analysis to check for successful oxidation, the peptide was column purified and lyophilized. Finally, the peptide was analyzed for purity and the mass value of the correct bicyclic dimer was verified. For the assays, peptides were solubilized in either deionized water or in 2.5&#x02013;50% CH<sub>3</sub>CN or dimethylformamide (DMF) to a final concentration of 5 mM. Molecular masses of single-chain dimeric peptides were assessed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF/MS) analysis according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Ciphergen Biosystems Ltd). Briefly, peptides were diluted to 1 pmol/&#x003bc;l in ProteinChip EAM-1 matrix (Bio-Rad) solubilized in 0.5% (v/v) TFA and 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. One picomole of this solution was spotted onto a ProteinChip NP20 array (Bio-Rad) and left to air-dry. The samples were analyzed in the positive ionization mode on a SELDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Ciphergen Biosystems). The m/z spectrum was calibrated using bovine ubiquitin standard (8564.8 Da) (Bio-Rad).</p></sec><sec><title>Production of soluble extracellular domains of human Fc&#x003b3;Rs</title><p>Human Fc&#x003b3;RI extracellular domain was obtained from a commercial source (R&#x00026;D Systems Inc.), which was expressed in the mouse NS0 cell line fused to the signal peptide of human CD33 and to a polyhistidine tag.

Trypan blue (0.4%) was added to each sample for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C to quench the extracellular fluorescence. The proportion of cells loaded with fluorescent bead complexes was determined by using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK), and the data were processed by CellQuest Pro Software.

The most similar cyclic peptide (code 1s6w) corresponded to the synthetic hepcidin peptide from hybrid white striped bass <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">(25)</xref>. The NMR structure of this peptide was used for building a homology model using the program PRIME (Schr&#x000f6;dinger, LLC, Portland, OR, USA). After the initial model was built the program suite AMBER8 was used to perform a short molecular dynamics simulation in explicit water. The system was solvated by adding a cubic box of pre-equilibrated TIP3P water, and then minimized (conjugate gradient) and equilibrated using the Langevin temperature equilibration scheme and SHAKE constraints on hydrogen atoms. During the simulation temperature and pressure were maintained constant at 300 K and 1 atm. The simulation was run for a total of 2 ns, and the structure reached stability after 1.3 ns. The average structure over the final 700 ps was calculated and minimized. In parallel, a homology model of Fc&#x003b3;RI was built and refined using the program PRIME and based on the sequence and structure of the receptor within the hFc&#x003b3;RIII-Fc complex <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">(18)</xref>. As a starting point to modeling Fc&#x003b3;RI-peptide complexes, residues Leu10 to Gly12 of the peptide were brought into proximity with Fc&#x003b3;RI as per the motif Leu234-Gly237 of the B-chain of the Fc fragment in complex with Fc&#x003b3;RIII. Similarly, residues Leu11 and Pro8 of the peptide were introduced to Fc&#x003b3;RI as per the motif residue Leu235 and Pro239 of the A-chain of the Fc fragment in complex with Fc&#x003b3;RIII. Subsequently, Fc&#x003b3;RI-peptide complexes were optimized using standard molecular mechanics techniques (as implemented in MacroModel) to ensure consistent placement of side chain and to eliminate physically unreasonable steric interactions between them.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Selection of Fc&#x003b3;RI binding phage-peptides</title><p>Unlike linear peptides, constrained peptides have restricted conformational freedom that often generates ligands with increased affinity and specificity <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">(26)</xref>.

Three naive 16-mer monocyclic libraries (CPEP-4, CPEP-8, and CPEP-10) were fused at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end of the pIII mature protein and displayed in polyvalent format on the M13 bacteriophage surface. To modify phage-peptide selection stringency, the receptor concentration, the phage input, and the number of washing cycles were varied according to three sets of conditions (conditions 1, 2, and 3). In addition, to select phage-peptides specific for the IgG1-Fc binding site, elution with IgG1 was performed. Following biopanning a significant increase in the number of eluted phage-peptides was observed only with the CPEP-8 library (&#x0223c;2000-fold after round 2 and under the first set of conditions). The phage-peptide sequences revealed seventeen unique sequences that shared strong homology and fitted the general consensus sequence TX<sub>2</sub>CXX&#x003b8;PXLLGC&#x003a6;XE (&#x003b8; represents a hydrophobic residue which is often L or W, and &#x003a6; is usually an acidic amino acid residue) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The peptide sequences varied according to selection conditions, which revealed that each biopanning condition was unique. Close to 70% of amino acid residues enclosed between the cystine residues display hydrophobic side chains. The C-terminal tripeptide sequence flanking the cyclic ring comprises one or more acidic residues. The linear mapping of the consensus onto the IgG1 primary sequence showed a strong similarity with the fragment 232&#x02013;236 (EU numbering) overlapping the lower hinge at the C<sub>H</sub>2 domain N terminus <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">(Table 1)</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding to Fc&#x003b3;RI and activation of receptor-mediated functions</title><p>Initially we examined whether selected peptides could antagonize IgG1 binding for Fc&#x003b3;RI.

Inactive peptides were either uncyclized (peptides 35 and 37) or did not exhibit the dipeptide motif Leu10-Leu11 in the hydrophobic core (peptide 34).

The control peptide corresponding to the linear hinge-C<sub>H</sub>2 sequence 227&#x02013;244 from IgG1 (p hinge-C<sub>H</sub>2) did not inhibit the binding of IgG1 to the receptor over the concentration range tested.

All the other peptides tested, as exemplified by peptides 21, 27, and the linear hinge peptide, failed to trigger a superoxide burst. Interestingly, the cyclic hinge-C<sub>H</sub>2 peptide (cp hinge-C<sub>H</sub>2) lacked any functional properties. To examine the structural contribution of the disulfide bond, the covalent bridge in peptide 22 was omitted (peptide 22 S<sub>4</sub>S<sub>13</sub>).

The 4 strong peptide agonists could inhibit superoxide generation in a dose-dependent manner, but were 3 orders of magnitude less effective as monomers relative to monomeric IgG1 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Thus, the apparent IC<sub>50</sub> values were between 1 to 2 &#x003bc;M for peptides 22, 30, and 33, and 20 &#x003bc;M for peptide 29. Interestingly, in addition to competing IgG1 for binding to Fc&#x003b3;RI (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), some nonagonist peptides, especially peptides 21 and 27, could inhibit the activity of multimeric peptide 33 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 15 and 7 &#x003bc;M, respectively. In addition, cyclic and linear hinge-C<sub>H</sub>2 peptides and peptide 22 S<sub>4</sub>S<sub>13</sub> were only weakly able or unable to prevent receptor-mediated functions triggered by multimeric peptide 33.

Peptide binding to each receptor was compared with IgG1 binding (equivalent to 100%) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></bold></xref>). The binding assays showed clearly that the 4 peptides interacted efficiently with Fc&#x003b3;RI but did not cross-react with the other receptor classes (while only the binding to Fc&#x003b3;RIIIa is shown, the results were similar for the other low affinity receptors). Additionally, no significant binding to any Fc&#x003b3;Rs was detected for the linear or cyclic hinge-C<sub>H</sub>2 peptides (data not shown).

The lack of favorable interactions that Leu11 makes with Fc&#x003b3;RIII would contribute to the lack of binding of peptide 33 with Fc&#x003b3;RIII (data not shown).

The 17 phage-octapeptides share a strong sequence homology, such that approaching 90% of clones contain the tripeptide LLG within the hydrophobic core and the majority exhibit the LPXLLG motif. Most of them can inhibit IgG binding to Fc&#x003b3;RI (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Some can trigger Fc&#x003b3;RI-mediated effector functions efficiently (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and also inhibit IgG-mediated Fc&#x003b3;RI activation within a micromolar concentration range (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Conversely, some nonagonist peptides can also antagonize Fc&#x003b3;RI activation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). These latter peptides represent a class of &#x0201c;Fc nonmimetic peptides&#x0201d; that may lack sufficient avidity to trigger receptor-mediated effector function when in multimeric form, but can inhibit effector function at sufficiently high concentrations when in soluble form. Another explanation is that the Fc nonmimetic peptides may have a set of incomplete or unfavorable structural determinants, required to colocate Fc&#x003b3;RI molecules appropriately <italic>via</italic> the Fc-binding site.</p><p>Many studies based on single amino acid mutations or on chimeric antibodies have reported the involvement of the sequence E<sub>233</sub>LLGGP<sub>238</sub> of IgG1 in the recognition of all Fc&#x003b3;R <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">(42)</xref>, and especially residues Leu234 and Leu235 for Fc&#x003b3;RI <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">(37)</xref>.

This model also underlined the significant role of the loop at residues 327-333 and, more particularly, that of the Pro329 residue. In our study, the linear hinge-C<sub>H</sub>2 peptide corresponding to the hinge fragment sequence of IgG1, the cyclic hinge-C<sub>H</sub>2 peptide enclosing the hinge sequence according to the CPEP-8 format, and linear peptide 22 were unable to trigger a superoxide burst and showed only a weak ability to antagonize IgG-mediated effector functions. These observations suggest that the LLG motif is necessary but not sufficient to confer function. Consequently, we conclude that the peptide core sequence does not correspond simply to the lower hinge sequence P<sub>232</sub>ELLG<sub>236</sub> of IgG1, but in contrast is comprised of several noncontiguous determinants folded closely into a scaffold of 8 amino acid residues that are required to make the peptide functional.</p><p>Modeling studies of the Fc&#x003b3;R1-peptide 33 complex reveal 2 complementary conformers able to mimic the functional interface of both Fc chains (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic></xref>). The character of this interaction is principally hydrophobic and includes contributions by Pro8 and Leu11 of the A-chain conformer (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>) and Leu11 of the B-chain conformer (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>D</italic></xref>). This model suggests that Pro8 in the PXLLG core motif does not match Pro232 from the lower hinge but rather Pro329 in the F/G loop of the C<sub>H</sub>2 domain.

Unlike IgG1 where the stoichiometry with Fc&#x003b3;RI is 1:1, it is plausible that the dimeric peptide binds Fc&#x003b3;RI with a ratio 1:2 and so can elicit functional cross-linking of 2 Fc&#x003b3;RI monomers.</p><p>Identification of such peptides could contribute to the characterization of the structural basis of the Fc&#x003b3;R1-IgG interaction and help to better define Fc&#x003b3;RI clustering mechanisms in their quantitative, structural, and mechanistic aspects.
