However, approaches to non-invasively visualize the persistence of transferred T cells are lacking. We examined whether positron emission tomography (PET) can monitor the distribution of self-antigen-specific T cells engineered to express an herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (<italic>sr39tk</italic>) PET reporter gene. Micro-PET imaging using the <italic>sr39tk</italic>-specific substrate 9-[4-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)-butyl]guanine ([<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG) enabled the detection of transplanted T cells in secondary lymphoid organs of recipient mice over a 3-week period. Tumor responses could be predicted as early as 3 days following AT when a &#x0003e;25-fold increase of micro-PET signal in the spleen and 2-fold increase in lymph nodes (LNs) were observed in mice receiving combined immunotherapy versus control mice. The lower limit of detection was &#x0223c;7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> T cells in the spleen and 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> T cells in LNs. Quantification of transplanted T cells in the tumor was hampered by the <italic>sr39tk</italic>-independent trapping of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG within the tumor architecture. These data support the feasibility of using PET to visualize the expansion, homing and persistence of transferred T cells. PET may have significant clinical utility by providing the means to quantify anti-tumor T cells throughout the body and provide early correlates for treatment efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>T lymphocytes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent advances in tumor immunology have led to the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer. While clinical trials using cancer vaccines have yielded low objective response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), recent approaches based on adoptive cell transfer immunotherapy have shown significantly higher efficacy. Rosenberg and colleagues have demonstrated partial and complete responses in &#x0223c;50% of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with adoptive transfer (AT) of <italic>ex vivo</italic> expanded autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and a lymphodepleting host conditioning regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). However, it remains unclear why some patients do not respond to treatment. Potential explanations include low TCR affinity for tumor antigens, sub-optimal <italic>in vivo</italic> expansion, failure of adoptively transferred T cells to gain access to secondary lymphoid organs or lack of tumor targeting. Currently, conventional immune monitoring approaches to address some of these potential rate-limiting steps involve quantitative and functional analyses of T cells isolated from peripheral blood or tumor biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). While these assays provide critical data, their main limitation stems from the inability to accurately reflect the dynamic changes in the distribution and numbers of T cells in lymphoid organs and at tumor sites. In particular, the potential for sampling error is increased in patients with metastatic disease and/or tumor lesions that are poorly accessible to surgical or fine needle biopsies. There is a need for non-invasive whole-body immune monitoring assays that correlate and/or predict the clinical end-points of adoptive immunotherapy trials.</p><p>The advent of molecular imaging techniques could overcome these limitations by enabling serial and non-invasive visualization of adoptively transferred T cells throughout the body. Various techniques based on optical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) or magnetic resonance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) imaging modalities have been used to visualize T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. We and others have focused on developing positron emission tomography (PET) imaging approaches for immune monitoring [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>)]. PET allows three-dimensional (3D) and quantitative measurements of the tissue accumulation of probes labeled with positron emitting radioisotopes. The sensitivity of PET is in the low nanomolar range and, unlike optical imaging modalities, measurements of probe accumulation are minimally impaired by tissue absorption and scattering. Importantly, PET studies in animal models are fully translatable to the clinic. Clinical PET scanners have similar sensitivities to micro-PET instruments used to image rodents. Furthermore, while their spatial resolution is a log order less than that of pre-clinical imaging systems, the physical size of the imaged human subject is also several orders of magnitude larger thereby reducing the resolution requirements.</p><p>A common thread among previous studies on PET imaging of anti-tumor T-cell responses relates to the strong immunogenicity of cancer antigens targeted in these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Using PET reporter gene imaging, Koehne <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) visualized the accumulation of EBV-specific T cells in EBV-positive tumors expressing the correct HLA-restricting element but not in EBV-negative or HLA-mismatched tumors. In a series of studies, our group has demonstrated the capability of PET reporter gene imaging to monitor primary and secondary anti-tumor T-cell responses to xenoantigens encoded by sarcoma-inducing oncoretroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Su <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) established a correlation between the numbers of anti-tumor T cells specific for a model antigen and the retention of the reporter probe measured by PET. Similarly, another recent study correlated PET signal intensities over time with quantitation of transduced EBV-specific T cells detected in the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). While these studies have validated the feasibility of using PET reporter gene imaging for monitoring anti-tumor immunity, T-cell responses to strong foreign or model antigens are quantitatively different than those against non-mutated self-antigens more commonly expressed by human cancers of non-viral etiologies. In general, such autoreactive immune responses are of much lower magnitude than responses to foreign antigens and are mediated by low affinity T cells that have evaded central and peripheral tolerance induction mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). These differences raise the question whether PET reporter gene imaging has the required sensitivity to allow monitoring of T-cell responses against non-mutated self-antigens that are frequently targeted by adoptive immunotherapies in melanoma and other types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we used a model of adoptive immunotherapy against melanoma which reproduces several key aspects of the adoptive immunotherapy clinical trials performed at the National Cancer Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). To enable detection of T cells following AT, we transduced these cells with the PET reporter gene <italic>sr39tk</italic>, an optimized variant of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) thymidine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Cells engineered to express <italic>sr39tk</italic> can be visualized by micro-PET using the high-affinity substrate (9-[4-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)-butyl]guanine ([<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p><p>The findings of the current study were 3-fold: (i) the quantitation of T-cell expansion in lymphoid organs as measured by [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG micro-PET scans at early time points following AT was predictive of the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy; (ii) <italic>sr39tk</italic>-expressing melanoma-specific T cells can be serially imaged by [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG micro-PET and (iii) the sensitivity of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG PET reporter gene imaging enables detection of very low numbers of <italic>sr39tk</italic>+ T cells present in the spleen and lymph nodes (LNs) of treated mice. These data suggest that the ability of non-invasive PET imaging to measure the reconstitution, expansion and persistence of adoptively transferred T cells into patients may have significant clinical utility for providing early predictions of treatment efficacy. PET reporter imaging approaches can be incorporated into the design of clinical trials to evaluate novel adoptive T-cell-based immunotherapies against melanoma and other types of cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and animals</title><p>B16-F10 (B16), a murine melanoma cell line, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA).

CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from these mice express a TCR specific for an antigenic epitope derived from the unmutated melanoma/melanocyte-associated antigen, gp100.

To investigate these possibilities, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Pro-B cell lines (Ba/F3) engineered to stably express <italic>sr39tk</italic> were used as positive controls. <italic>In vitro</italic>, B16 cells did not retain or phosphorylate [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG after 1 h incubation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxn133/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1A</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxn133/DC1">B</ext-link>, available at <italic>International Immunology</italic> Online). Unlike <italic>sr39tk</italic>+ Ba/F3 and pmel T cells, which incorporated [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG into the DNA after 4 h, DNA incorporation of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG was undetectable in B16 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxn133/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1C</ext-link>, available at <italic>International Immunology</italic> Online). Mice bearing B16 and Ba/F3-<italic>sr39tk</italic> tumors were injected with [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG and 1 h later mice were sacrificed to isolate tumor cells. In contrast to Ba/F3-<italic>sr39tk</italic> tumors, there was no detectable retention, phosphorylation or DNA incorporation of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG in the B16, <italic>sr39tk</italic>-negative tumors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxn133/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1D</ext-link>&#x02013;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxn133/DC1">F</ext-link>, available at <italic>International Immunology</italic> Online). Non-specific probe trapping could also be explained by the particular architecture of the B16 tumors. These tumors are highly vascularized and show areas of blood pooling which could decrease probe clearance, as shown by histology and autoradiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>). Given these observations, in subsequent experiments, we focused on imaging T cells in secondary lymphoid organs which, in contrast to B16 lesions, do not show non-specific retention of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG.</p></sec><sec><title>[<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG micro-PET/CT serial imaging detects changes in the persistence and trafficking of adoptively transferred T cells</title><p>Eight mice treated with the full regime were serially imaged by [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG micro-PET between days 1 and 21 post-AT.

No [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG micro-PET spleen signals could be detected after day 8 (data not shown). These dynamic changes in the splenic [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG retention could reflect the rapid initial expansion of adoptively transferred cells due to homeostatic proliferation in a lymphodepleted environment with an exogenous supply of IL-2 and/or the antigen-dependent T-cell proliferation by gp100-pulsed DCs, followed by the contraction phase at later time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Alternatively, the loss of the [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG spleen signal after day 8 could indicate the homing of the <italic>sr39tk</italic>+ T cells to LNs, the tumor site and other organs. Accordingly, starting on day 3 post-transfer, six out of eight mice showed significant [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG accumulation in several LN groups including axillary, brachial and cervical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxn133/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>, available at <italic>International Immunology</italic> Online).

In contrast to the spleen signal, the accumulation of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG in LN groups was more sustained and could be detected beyond day 8, until day 19. It is important to note that the patterns of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG accumulation in LNs were highly variable between individual mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxn133/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>, available at <italic>International Immunology</italic> Online). Furthermore, we did not observe higher [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG accumulation in tumor DLNs relative to contralateral LNs.

Although promising &#x02018;proof-of-concept&#x02019; studies have been reported in recent years, identification of suitable biomarkers of protective T-cell anti-tumor immune responses remains a major challenge. We describe a PET reporter gene imaging approach which allows visualization of melanoma-specific T cells following AT in tumor-bearing mice. The advantages of this approach are as follows: (i) the ability to sequentially monitor adoptive immunotherapy for extended periods of time; (ii) high sensitivity, as demonstrated by the capability to detect rare populations of T cells at various anatomical locations and (iii) the safety, pharmacokinetics and dosimetry of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG have been studied in rats, rabbits and normal human volunteers, and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved its use as an investigational new drug in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). These studies simplify the regulatory steps required to translate this imaging approach from mice to cancer patients. [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG PET imaging of adenovirally introduced <italic>HSV1-tk</italic> into tumors of patients with hepatocellular cancer has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Another advantage of this approach is that <italic>HSV1-tk</italic> was originally designed for suicide gene therapy of cancer. Thus, <italic>HSV1-tk</italic> would be delivered to cancer cells and then administration of a pharmacological dose of gancyclovir would cause death of these cells. This built-in safety feature should prevent possible adverse effects, including malignant transformation as a consequence of random insertion of viral constructs and life-threatening autoimmunity. The combination of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG and <italic>HSV1-sr39tk</italic> can also be used for monitoring the distribution of stem cells and the effects of suicide gene therapy in clinical trials.</p><p>Several clinical trials showed that HSV1-tk gene-modified lymphocytes for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants in leukemic patients could be detected in circulation, bone marrow and peripheral tissues for &#x0003e;12 months, while maintaining their anti-tumor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). However, using quantitative PCR assays, these studies have also revealed a significant incidence (in &#x0223c;23% of patients) of immune responses against HSV1-tk, leading to a decrease in the number of circulating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). In contrast, it is possible that the myeloablative chemotherapeutic regime will significantly reduce the possibility of host immune responses against <italic>sr39tk</italic>+ adoptively transferred T cells. Other options to approach the immunogenicity problem are to (i) use less immunogenic HSV1-<italic>sr39tk</italic> variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>) or (ii) develop alternative non-immunogenic PET reporter genes. In this context, a recent study by Ponomarev <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>) proposed the use of the human thymidine kinase 2 as a potentially non-immunogenic PET reporter gene. The human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) has been recently evaluated as a potentially non-immunogenic PET reporter gene. Using the norepinephrine analog <sup>124</sup>I-MIBG, Doubrovin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) showed that as few as 10<sup>4</sup> T lymphocytes transduced <italic>ex vivo</italic> with an hNET construct could be visualized by micro-PET <italic>in vivo</italic>. The investigators used this approach to monitor tumor infiltration by antigen-specific T lymphocytes. The availability of <sup>18</sup>F-labeled hNET substrates could widen the applicability of this approach for monitoring cell-based therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). The development of novel PET probed specific for immune cells could enable direct imaging of immune responses and therefore circumvent the use of PET reporter genes. We have recently developed 1-(2&#x02032;-deoxy-2&#x02032;-<sup>18</sup>F-fluoroarabino-furanosyl) cytosine ([<sup>18</sup>F]FAC), a novel PET imaging probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). [<sup>18</sup>F]FAC enabled visualization of lymphoid organs such as thymus, spleen and LNs by micro-PET. The probe was useful for imaging localized immune activation in a mouse model of anti-tumor immunity and enabled detection of changes in lymphoid mass in systemic autoimmunity.</p><p>Another potential limitation of <italic>sr39tk</italic> PET reporter imaging is the non-specific accumulation of the <italic>sr39tk</italic> substrate [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG in B16 melanoma lesions. This could complicate the visualization of adoptively transferred T cells in the target tissue. It is currently unclear whether the [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG background at the tumor site represents a more general problem or an experimental artifact specific to the B16 melanoma. We found that the architecture of these B16 tumor lesions includes areas of relatively large blood pools which may cause non-specific probe trapping. In contrast to other tumors in which [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG slowly clears from the tumors after 2&#x02013;3 h, the probe did not clear from B16 tumors during this time frame (data not shown). Moreover, our data showed that the trapping of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG is correlated with the size of the tumor. This finding complicated our experiments because these tumors quickly reach &#x0003e;1 cm in diameter 1&#x02013;2 weeks after injection of as few as 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> melanoma cells. The non-specific retention of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG has not been observed in other tumors studied by our group and others [i.e. retroviral induced rhabdomyosarcoma and EL4 tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>)]. A study by Penuelas <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) allowed visualization of adenoviral-mediated transgene expression in the liver tumors of patients after the initial non-specific accumulation of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG by hepatocytes was cleared through the gall bladder.</p><p>The issue of potential non-specific [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG accumulation in human cancers still needs to be addressed. If such non-specific [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG signals are observed, then baseline PET scans prior to adoptive therapy might be required. The [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG &#x02018;background&#x02019; may be relatively constant since tumors in patients do not grow as rapidly as the B16 tumors. To further demonstrate the feasibility of this imaging approach, we have imaged mice with large tumors (&#x0003e;1 cm diameter) before and after intratumoral injections of pmel-<italic>sr39tk</italic> T cells. The [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG signal in the tumor following T-cell injection increased by 3- to 5-fold (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxn133/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link>, available at <italic>International Immunology</italic> Online). Nonetheless, our findings indicate the need to further optimize existing PET reporter gene approaches by (i) development of PET reporter genes that are less immunogenic and potentially more sensitive than <italic>sr39tk</italic> and (ii) radiochemical synthesis and testing of novel <italic>sr39tk</italic> substrates with lower non-specific accumulation than FHBG.</p></sec><sec><title>The lower limit of detection of PET reporter gene imaging</title><p>The approach described here was sensitive to variations in the strength of the immunotherapeutic regime and allowed quantitative measurements of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG accumulation in the spleen and LNs of treated mice. These measurements correlated well with the numbers of <italic>sr39tk</italic>+ melanoma-specific T cells present at these sites determined <italic>ex vivo</italic> using flow cytometry. We observed that the lower limit of detection, defined as the lowest number of <italic>sr39tk</italic>+ T cells detected by micro-PET, was dependent on the anatomical location of these cells. In the spleen, the lower limit of detection was &#x0223c;7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> <italic>sr39tk</italic>+ T cells or in terms of accumulated radioactivity, &#x0223c;55 nCi of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG. To enable detection by micro-PET, at least &#x0223c;10% of the total number of cells in the spleen had to express the <italic>sr39tk</italic> reporter. In contrast, the limit of detection in LNs was 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> <italic>sr39tk</italic>+ cells, corresponding to &#x0223c;2&#x02013;5 nCi of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG, or a frequency of at least &#x0223c;3% of the total number of cells. The apparent discrepancy between sensitivity parameters in spleen and LNs could be explained by the different architecture of these secondary lymphoid organs. Unlike LNs that consist mainly of lymphocytes, spleens contain a red pulp compartment populated by macrophages and erythrocytes and few lymphocytes. Our data indicate a density of white blood cells in the spleen of &#x0223c;0.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> mm<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> compared with &#x0223c;3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> mm<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> in a LN.</p><p>When clinical PET scanners are used to image the heart, brain or tumors, signals from tissues of interest are typically 1.5- to 10-fold above background levels. Our data are within this dynamic range. For example, although PET signal from the brain striatum is typically &#x0223c;3-fold over background levels in healthy individuals, the precision of PET allows clinicians to monitor the loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>).</p><p>While our results indicate that PET reporter gene imaging has sufficient sensitivity to enable repeated and non-invasive monitoring of adoptive immunotherapy in a clinically relevant animal model, further improvements might be necessary to fully achieve the potential of this approach. The limit of detection of small animal PET scanners is related to both their sensitivity as well as their intrinsic noise characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). While our studies used the micro-PET Focus 220 system (3.5% sensitivity), new instruments such as the Inveon micro-PET (Siemens) are expected to have three times larger peak sensitivity (&#x0223c;10%), from purely geometrical considerations. Furthermore, methods to reduce the intrinsic noise that stems from the natural radioactivity background of the tomographs have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">45</xref>). Both these factors (increased sensitivity and energy windowing) can be applied simultaneously to acquisitions that are approaching the limit of detection. It is therefore likely that future studies will enable imaging of a much lower number of cells than those shown here. It is important to note that the lower limit of detection is essentially the same throughout the mouse body (surface or deep), in contrast to bioluminescence or other optical imaging modalities. Similar improvements to enhance sensitivity and resolution are also being performed on clinical PET scanners.</p></sec><sec><title>PET imaging biomarkers to evaluate adoptive immunotherapies</title><p>A critical finding of our work was that no reproducible patterns of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG accumulation in different LNs across different time points and animals could be observed. While this finding likely reflects the inherent individual variability of T-cell responses and the need for longitudinal immune monitoring studies at a whole-body level, it also raises the question of how PET reporter gene imaging can assist the development of predictive biomarkers. Furthermore, our data emphasize the utility of using reporter gene imaging to non-invasively follow and further understand the variability of distribution and expansion of adoptively transferred T cells in lymphoid organs of patients. Concerning the B16 melanoma model, we observed that the most informative scans were those performed at early time points following AT. Thus, mice showing at least 2-fold increase of [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG retention in the spleen and LNs rejected the B16 tumors, whereas the lack of PET probe accumulation at these sites correlated with tumor progression. Importantly, while [<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG micro-PET scans at later time points (up to 3 weeks) still showed a similar correlation, the treatment efficacy was easily assessed after day 5 by simply measuring the tumor volumes using calipers or CT imaging. Future studies are required to determine whether our findings regarding the optimal schedule of PET reporter gene imaging for defining predictive biomarkers can be generalized to other models of adoptive immunotherapy.</p><p>In conclusion, PET reporter gene imaging of AT of melanoma-specific T cells can be used to study the <italic>in vivo</italic> dynamics of AT of tumor antigen-specific T cells and to define non-invasive predictive biomarkers of treatment efficacy. This technique is amenable to clinical translation and could be incorporated in the next generation of clinical trials to evaluate novel immunotherapy approaches in melanoma and potentially other malignancies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intimm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dxn133/DC1">Supplementary figures</ext-link> are available at <italic>International Immunology</italic> Online.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><grant-sponsor>Dana Foundation; Merck Research Laboratories</grant-sponsor> to C.G.R.; <grant-sponsor>Fred Eiserling and Judith Lengyel Graduate Doctorate Fellowship</grant-sponsor> to C.J.S.; <grant-sponsor>US Department of Energy Contract</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>DE-FG02-06ER64249</grant-num>) to M.E.P.; <grant-sponsor>National Cancer Institute Grant</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>R24CA92865</grant-num>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="dxn133_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="dxn133_intimm-08-0134-File003_dxn133.ppt"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term>AT</term><def><p>adoptive transfer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATX</term><def><p>adoptive transfer treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p>computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>3D</term><def><p>three-dimensional</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DC</term><def><p>dendritic cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DLAM</term><def><p>Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DLN</term><def><p>draining LN</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>[<sup>18</sup>F]FAC</term><def><p>1-(2&#x02032;-deoxy-2&#x02032;-<sup>18</sup>F-fluoroarabino-furanosyl) cytosine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>[<sup>18</sup>F]FHBG</term><def><p>9-[4-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl]guanine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>hNET</term><def><p>human norepinephrine transporter</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSV1</term><def><p>herpes simplex virus 1; i.v., intravenously</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LN</term><def><p>lymph node</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSCV</term><def><p>murine stem cell virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PET</term><def><p>positron emission tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PLN</term><def><p>peripheral LN</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROI</term><def><p>region of interest</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>seYFP</italic></term><def><p>super enhanced yellow fluorescent protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>sr39tk</italic></term><def><p>HSV1 thymidine kinase; s.c., subcutaneously</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>XRT</term><def><p>X-ray therapy</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We are grateful to W.
