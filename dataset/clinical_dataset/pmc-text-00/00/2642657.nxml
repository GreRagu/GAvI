The architectural geometric expression was described on macroscopic and microscopic levels mainly in cancer processes. On the basis of the electro-optical model, research has demonstrated that molecular crystals are represented by triangular chiral hexagons. These triangular chiral hexagons are derived from collision events against collagen type I fibrils, emerging at microscopic and macroscopic scales in the lateral assembly of each side of the hypertrophy of the helicoid fibers. The helicoids fibers represent flow of energy in hierarchically cooperative chiral electromagnetic interaction in pathological tissues, and arise as geometry of the equilibrium in perturbed biological systems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-Daz1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref></p><p>In this article we have documented and gathered insights into the magnetic field in cancer tissues and how it generates a functional geometric attractor complex in their entangled environment. This geometry occurs on documented collider partners, that is, pairs of spiral subpatterns twisted in opposite directions that generate in this rotational movement powerful electromagnetic forces. These forces are exerted over collagen type 1 fibrils and influence the dipole behavior of vascular cells. Centrifugal expansion happens when the axis spins in one direction and contraction happens when centripetal forces spin in the opposite direction. This causal effect evolves onto collagen-vascular framework that surges when the appropriate matrix environment is provided to maintain relatively higher spatial organization.</p><p>Recently, for the first time, researchers from Hahn-Meitner-Institute (HMI) in Berlin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-kardjilov1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> have succeeded visualizing magnetic fields inside solid, nontransparent materials through direct 3D images. They used neutrons &#x02013; subatomic particles having zero net charge &#x02013; making them ideal for investigating magnetic phenomena in magnetic materials. Neutrons have an internal angular moment, referred to as &#x0201c;spin&#x0201d; in physics, which causes rotation around magnetic fields similar to the way in which the earth rotates on its axis. When all magnetic moments point in the same direction, the neutrons are polarized. If a magnetic sample is irradiated and then collisionate with such neutrons, the magnetic moments of the neutrons begin to rotate around the magnetic fields they encounter in the sample and the spinning direction changes. By detecting spin changes, it is possible to &#x0201c;see&#x0201d; the magnetic field in the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). When comparing their laboratory product image with the images from the present study, the authors detected that both patterns were exceptionally similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g001">Fig. 1B, 1C</xref>). There are statistical universal laws of physics that govern the behavior of magnetic fields. Under this invariant common denominator pattern, one can now apply what is observed and known in other more complex biological or physical systems. Cancer is then revealed as a microcosmos, an excellent model to study chaos both from biological and physical point of view, where collisions, accelerations, and rotational movements generate forms that converge in functions at the interior of the disordered systems. Form is function.</p><fig id="pone-0004506-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004506.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Magnetic field and entangled geometry of a spiral dipole collagen type I vascular framework in cancer tissues.</title><p>Panel A.

It is in such areas where the vessels penetrate into the tumor.</p><p>The vascular net represents the vital nutritional life support of the tumor. On the premise that behind spiral subpatterns of GTCHC complexes a corresponding vascular order must exist, the authors decided to revise rigorously macroscopic and microscopic material of malignant tumors in which GTCHC complexes were identified and coupled with von Willebrand Factor VIII-related antigen analysis. There were a total of 216 old cases and 333 new ones were incorporated. The revision followed the same parameters that were established in the initial phase of the investigation, but with a new item, the visualization and documentation of dorsal serous vascular bed areas in spatial correlation with GTCHC complexes.

In biological terms, it means vasoactive process such as vasoconstriction and vasodilatation behavior, because it is known that vascular cells are influenced by magnetic fields. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-Okazaki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref></p><p>To produce such an effect, we have used the standard methodology as in the first publication. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-Daz1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> The electro-optical model consisted of an electronic flash device attached to a Sony camera model DSC-S600.

To avoid lens flare, the experiment was performed in complete darkness. There were 1-h photographic sessions during a 9-day time interval.

The interpretation is that malignant tumors, regardless of the type of tumor, generate geometric attractors amid the biological chaos. This is the intelligent design that nature selects to generate order from disorder. These are not flat geometry; on the contrary, it has surfaces and volumes and is essentially functional. This hierarquic attractor has an invariant morphology of collider partners based on triangular mirror images linked by spirals that represent the interface of molecules that are expanding and contracting within the system, within a specific space-time interval showing both ends of the molecular existence. The life and death of the malignant cells in terms of proliferative and apoptosis status represents the most functional structure sufficient for the flow and delivery of oxygen to tissues for self-repairs. It is interesting to note that this assembly fits exactly with the triangular shape of the lungs that link with the inverted triangular that represents the heart morphology&#x02014;a trough helicoidal vessel.</p><p>Even more interesting is that these patterns have been replicated with great accuracy through the electro-optical model, which indicates a common mechanism generating these geometries and magnetic fields. In making this statement, the authors have the support of recent investigations showing the first 3D images of a magnetic field.</p><p>Nikolay Kardjilov's group used this phenomenon as a measurement parameter for tomography experiments using two spin polarizers (which only allow the passage of neutrons whose spin points in a specific direction) to polarize and then analyze the neutrons. By detecting changes in the spins, it is possible to &#x0201c;see&#x0201d; the magnetic fields within the sample.</p><p>When comparing this image of a magnetic field in a 3D laboratory with those observed in malignant tissue, the similarity is stunning. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g001">Figs. 1A, 1B, 1C</xref>). This fact proves the universality of the physical laws: collider patterns form pairs of dark white nodular areas oriented in opposite directions, linking a trough collagen bridge that results in the dipole functional behavior of the system.</p><p>The integration of GTCHC complexes in the ventral and cut surfaces of the tumor with the spiral vascular subpatterns from the dorsal areas results as the visualization of strategic unknown functional volumetric geometric attractor in malignant tissues. What corroborates the idea that the dynamic geometric order occurs through magnetic field activity? As fibers of collagen type I are the largest component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), they are also the biggest generators of electromagnetic activity owing to their piezoelectric ability and conductor behavior. For this reason, mirror images on either side of the midline as well as its poles can be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g006">Figs. 6A, 6B, 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g007">7A</xref>).</p><p>Similar to the manner by which magnetism affects vascular behavior,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-Okazaki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-Higashi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> it influences collagen fibers as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-Guo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-Girton1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-BouGharios1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> The vascular network is a series of linked conduits of blood vessels composed of the endothelium, a monolayer of cells that adorn the vessel lumen and surrounding layer(s) of mesenchymal cells (vascular smooth muscle, pericytes and fibroblasts). In addition to providing structural support, the mesenchymal cells are essential for vessel contractility and dilatation. The ECM is a major constituent of blood vessels and provides a framework in which these various cell types are attached and embedded. The composition and organization of vascular ECM is primarily controlled by the mesenchymal cells and is also responsible for the mechanical properties of the vessel wall, forming complex networks of highly regulated structural proteins. The ECM also plays a central role in cellular adhesion, differentiation, and proliferation. The cellular and extracellular matrix components of vessels, with specific emphasis on the regulation of collagen type I, have implications in vascular spatial organization.</p><p>The vascular ECM is a complex mixture of collagens, elastin, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. These constituents not only provide mechanical integrity to the vessel wall but comprise a repertoire of insoluble ligands that can signal the cell to control proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival. In the normal adult artery wall, the basement membrane is the primary ECM compartment that interacts with the vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC), and its components are believed to be important in maintaining a stable and well-differentiated SMC. However, during conditions of arterial restructuring, the ECM can be quickly remodeled through a combination of synthesis of new ECM molecules, regulated assembly of these molecules, and proteolytic degradation and editing of existing structures. Together, these actions provide a new and dynamic set of ECM stimuli that can have a profound effect on SMC behavior. Some of the major cellular sites for solid-state signaling are &#x0201c;focal adhesions&#x0201d; where integrin receptors mediate the transfer of mechanical force between the cytoskeleton and the ECM. When mechanical forces are applied directly to integrin receptors (e.g., using magnetic forces), cellular biochemistry and gene expression are altered in a stress-dependent manner. Forces applied to integrins activate many signaling pathways in these sites, including protein tyrosine phosphorylation, ion fluxes, cAMP production, and G protein signaling.</p><p>In this magnetic domain are attraction and repulsion forces that interact continuously; in physics, attraction between opposite poles is caused by the contraction of ether magnetic particle between the poles. Repulsion between same poles is caused by the expansion of ether magnetic particle between the poles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-Fraser1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> We were able to replicate, reproduce, and make these forces visible through the electro-optical model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g015">Figs. 15A, 15B, 15C, 15D</xref>). One can &#x0201c;see&#x0201d; these forces through the influence exerted by magnetic fields in the global components of the ECM, principally the collagen and the vascular network in cancer tissues. Opposite dipole behavior develops inside the tumor in terms of vasoconstriction and vasodilatation, flow and magnetic field induce collagen vascular alignment, and their magnetic lines finally form self-assembled triangular hexagon GTCHC complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g001">Figs. 1B, 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g002">2A, 2B</xref>).</p><p>The interrelation between the two components is explicit. Collagen conduction in the magnetic field and the vascular driver of fluid in structuring these geometric attractor frameworks habitually tend to treat the two components separately, although they clearly act in coexistence. The conductor (attractive/repulsive and flow) influences the behavior of the fluid and has opposite effects upon the boundaries of the system. It is clear that there exists a paired production behavior in the genesis of these structures. The electro-optical model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g018">Figs. 18A, 18B, 18C, 18D</xref>) mirrors what we also found in the pathological cancer tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g002">Figs. 2A, 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g003">3A, 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g004">4A, 4B</xref>). The literature supports this pairing behavior at different levels: at vascular levels, a multidisciplinary team made up of physicists and biologists from France and Germany&#x0002a; has discovered how, in the embryo, arteries and veins develop in parallel pairs. Using physical measurements, theoretical models, and numerical simulations, the researchers showed how the growth of the arteries directly controls that of the veins through a process that depends solely on the mechanical forces present. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-AlKilani1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> This signifies that most of the principal organs embryonically develop in pairs and are in intrinsic relation; during development, what affects one organ would necessarily influence the other paired organ. Pair production is the base of DNA and evolution. During cell division or mitosis, new cells are produced through the growth and division of existing cells. The process begins with the replication of the genetic material held in the chromosomes of the cell. The pairs of sister DNA molecules or chromatids are lined up before being pulled in opposite directions. Partitioning the original cell gives the two new daughter cells the full complement of chromosomes. Physics views pair production as the formation or materialization of two electrons, one negative and the other positive (positron), from a pulse of electromagnetic energy traveling through matter, usually in the vicinity of an atomic nucleus. Pair production is a direct conversion of radiant energy into matter.</p><p>Pair production also occurs in tumor biology, and we were fortunate to observe the geometric attractor in full dynamic activity at the macroscopic and microscopic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g010">Figs. 10A, 10B, 10C, 10D</xref>), showing the collagen vascular framework captured from malignant peritoneal effusion. It is possible to see two orbits in the inner and outer positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g010">Fig. 10C, 10D</xref>) originating from the nucleus. During rotation and vibration, the collagens emit spectral lines that are radial excitations of cellular components. However, the most astonishing characteristic of this image is the identification of triangular images born in pairs in inverted positions in each orbit. The two geometric structures originate from the same point; the two images are like twins separated at birth. The communication between these particles is clear, in disorder and in states of anarchy. Communication permits the interchange of information even when particles are not in intimate contact and are far apart. This is possible on the basis of paramagnetism. In physics, paramagnetism signifies that under the influence of an external magnetic field, outer orbital electrons in the atoms of the paramagnetic material will be aligned as a magnet. When the external field is removed, the aligned electrons retain its previous position and the material will lose the magnetism.</p><p>This law is the only way to explain the elaborate and structured art-like mosaic images that have been documented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g011">Figs. 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g012">12A, 12B</xref>), which means that there is a nexus, that is, an active intercommunication between these geometries that neither needs to be adjacent nor close. From this emerges the vital principle of non-cancer locality, a state in which the entire system is interconnected with other systems but mainly with the processes that are mirror images or in contralateral spatial position. The complex geometries and their constituents share information remotely and generate action. In this fractal geometry, the distance of the particles is irrelevant because the entangled pairs are created. In cancer tissues, hidden variants exist and they become visible only when pairs are created. When pairs of triangles were identified (which were until now hidden structures), they become visible and identifiable structures. In tumor biology behavior, these hidden particles stay in communication no matter how far the particles are. We believe that pair components influence the other component of the pair system even when apart. This communication behavior may come into play by virtue of a strong attraction developing between the colliding partners.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Dipole behavior</title><p>The images show that the vast majority of malignant tumors have dipole behavior. This was referred to in the previous article. Proliferate areas are in exceptional spatial mirror image position with asymmetric degenerative cystic zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g020">Figs. 20A, 20B, 20C, 20D</xref>). Such polarization is so extreme that it is possible to identify empty cell white nodular areas adjacent or linked through a collagen bridge with full cell nodular proliferative clusters. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g006">Figs. 6A, 6B, 6C</xref>) von Willebrand Factor VIII-related antigen characteristics polar immunoreactivity observed permit us determinate the geometric invariant attractor vascular origin and how such structure incorporate dipole behavior to the interior of malignant tissues, this is a consequence of correlated spatial asymmetric assembly of vasoactive vessels that experiment contraction-centripetal or expansion-centrifugal activity in concordance with the spin-spiraled orientation of the molecules. This particular dipole behavior may have great importance in the development of the life of the tumor. In a collision event, bond making reactions that release energy and bond breaking reactions that absorb energy exist. This principle is applicable for both nuclear and chemical reactions. This signifies that mass changes in this process; during expansion, energy is absorbed resulting in an increase of the net masses of the product&#x02013;mass gains. On the other hand, in the contraction area, the mass of the release matter decreases from the reactants original&#x02013;mass defect.</p><fig id="pone-0004506-g020" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004506.g020</object-id><label>Figure 20</label><caption><title>Dipole behavior effect on malignant tissues.</title><p>Panels A, B, C.

This dipole behavior signifies that each tumor can have vasoconstriction active areas that generate cystic degenerative changes and chromophobic microscopic characteristics related to apoptosis behavior. In mirror spatial position with vasodilatation, more dense vascular chromophilic microscopic areas are found, signifying more active metabolism in relation with more proliferative status.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Why triangulation?</title><p>In this section, we must revert to recent knowledge in physics. From the theory of Causal Dynamics Triangulation (CDT), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-Loll1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> it is widely accepted that at the very smallest scales space is not static, but is instead dynamically varying. Near the Planck scale, the structure of spacetime itself is constantly changing, because of quantum fluctuations. This theory uses a triangulation process that is dynamically varying and follows deterministic rules, or is dynamical enough to map out how this can evolve into dimensional spaces similar to that of our universe. Physics suggests that this is a good way to model the early universe, and describe its evolution. Using a structure called a simplex; it divides spacetime into tiny triangular sections. A simplex is the generalized form of a triangle, in various dimensions. A 3-simplex is usually called a tetrahedron, and the 4-simplex, which is the basic building block in this theory, is also known as the pentatope, or pentachoron. Each simplex is geometrically flat, but simplices can be &#x02018;glued&#x02019; together in a variety of ways to create curved spacetimes. Where previous attempts at triangulation of quantum spaces have produced jumbled universes with far too many dimensions, or minimal universes with too few, CDT avoids this problem by allowing only those configurations where cause precedes any event.</p><p>The disadvantageous aspect of this theory is that it relies heavily on computer simulations to generate results. It reveals cancer as a good model to study physics phenomena by virtue of being an environment of multiple collisions and dynamic fluctuations.</p><p>In the investigation, we have documented hundreds of triangular mirror images. It is a reality that has been extensively documented, and its frequency is directly proportional to the degree of tumor aggressiveness. Form is function: under this premise, in tumor biology, one can say that triangular geometric pattern represents for less the way to reorganize disturbed systems. We have outline the hypothesis to open the discussion in light of verifiable and reproducible facts on each patient who suffers from cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Some questions</title><p>After conducting this physics and biological approximation to explain the dynamics of the complex GTCHC, a reasonable doubt emerges: what happens at the macroscopic, microscopic, and molecular levels in the contralateral <italic>outside</italic> of a tumor primarily those arising in paired organs?

From this point of view, we have considered it fundamental that the single monopolar proliferative actual view of cancer must be replaced by a demonstrated dipole biologic behavior.</p><p>Recapitulating the findings of the first and actual article, we have affirmed that collision events in sequential stages identified in cancerous tissues are: Generation of collider partners &#x02013; particles that spin in opposite directions. In synchronic and simultaneous movement in the presence of a magnetic field, the electrons may point &#x02018;left&#x02019; or &#x02018;right&#x02019;. This rotation generates powerful magnetic field lines. The electron particles are aligned in their domain, and the flux in the magnetic lines are distributed in the ECM along the collagen and vascular components. Because electrons flow spirally through a conductor (collagen type I), these magnetic lines move with the spiral. Pair production, inherent pair development and dependence, induces the flux to flow in the opposite direction. In this manner, particles expand or go away, and others come closer or are contracted from a fixed point. This entangled phenomena produce dipole behavior in terms of metabolic proliferation and apoptosis status, a process that is revealed in multiple outbursts of biological collisions in malignant tumors. This complex is fractal always evolving into more complex geometric <italic>hexagonal</italic> structures over time-space intervals. It is a predictable and reproducible dynamic system. It is identified on systems in states of disorder regardless of the type of system involved. It has an invariant morphology with sets of triangular mirror images in opposite positions and spiral-patterned visible attractors. The hierarquic geometric attractor is important not only in human biologic tissues such as tumors but also in physics and is so <italic>universal</italic> that we have identified this invariant pattern for the first time in other perturbed systems: Inner workings of the immune system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-Ng1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g022">Fig. 22A, 22B, 22C, 22D</xref>) Brain cortex patients deceased from cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g023">Figs. 23A, 23B</xref>); in plant fungal pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g023">Figs. 23C, 23D</xref>); Galaxy collisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g024">Figs. 24A, 24B</xref>); Geological collision tectonic plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g024">Fig. 24C</xref>); and, in fact, routine and simple that when coffee and milk are mixed for breakfast, this attractor is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004506-g024">Fig. 24D</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004506-g022" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004506.g022</object-id><label>Figure 22</label><caption><title>Geometric attractor invariant morphology identified in inner workings of the immune system.</title><p>Panel A.

Virtually all biomolecular networks analyzed to date have this architecture. Stable, high-dimensional attractor states arise from the system level as a consequence of particular regulatory interactions between the network components (e.g., genes) that impose constraints on the global dynamics of the network; thus, the cell cannot occupy any arbitrary network state. On these theoretical grounds it is proposed that different cell types (e.g., lung vs. heart) represent different attractor states in the gene regulatory network. It is important because it explains how cells can simultaneously sense multiple chemical, adhesive, and mechanical inputs and yet only switch on one of a limited number of specific, reproducible behavioral responses. This may explain how global changes in shape are able to control cell-fate switching.</p><p>For this reason, structure dictates function in living cells &#x02013; cells can be switched between growth, differentiation, and death solely by varying the degree to which it physically distorts its shape. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-Huang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-Chen1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although the authors believe that geometry can control cells from growth to apoptosis through the macropatterned and micropatterned attractor collagen type I vascular framework of the ECM, the viability of the influence of magnetic fields substrates may represent a fundamental mechanism for the development of proliferative regulation within the tissue microenvironment.</p><p>At this point the findings suggest that in tumoral biology systems, geometric attractor patterns constituted collider partners, emerging when a steady equilibrium state is disturbed. These attractor patterns probably govern how molecules self-assemble from <italic>de novo</italic> holding a vision of a new renaissance tissue in a coherent expansion-contraction state.</p><p>In conjunction with the dimensional organization of intelligent functional geometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004506-Chen2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> it is determined that an invariant single common denominator pattern can drive multiple change scenarios that emit the precisely shaped signals necessary to incorporate notions of location control, a trough in the vasoconstriction and vasodilatation inside the system.
