These segments or "replication domains" replicate in a defined temporal order during S-phase. This replication-timing program is cell type specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and developmentally regulated changes in this program are associated with changes in chromatin structure and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In particular, a global re-organization of this replication-timing program occurs during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), with changes occurring at the level of large (~600 kb) chromosomal domains reflecting global re-positioning of sequences within the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Moreover, pluripotent cells can be distinguished from differentiated cells not only by differences in their replication timing profiles but by their smaller and more numerous replication domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Hence, replication timing is a unique epigenetic property of chromatin in that it is regulated at the level of megabase-sized domains. Establishing replication maps for various tissues is likely to provide a database of chromosome segments that undergo large changes in organization during differentiation.</p><p>The significance of a replication-timing program has remained elusive. In several model systems, defects in replication-timing are associated with defects in chromosome condensation, sister chromatid cohesion, and genome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Abnormal replication-timing control has become a clinical marker for predicting malignant cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In particular, specific chromosome translocations result in a chromosome-wide delay in replication timing that triggers additional chromosome translocations at a high frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Cells from patients with several inherited human diseases show defects in replication-timing that correlate with mis-regulation of genes during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Also, replication domains are separated by timing transition regions (the domain boundaries) that appear to be devoid of replication origins, requiring that a single replication fork travel very long distances between early and late replicating domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Evidence suggests that genes lying within these transition regions are prone to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. While very few such boundaries have been mapped, their cell-type specificity suggests the possibility that differential organization of replication domains may contribute to cell type specific predispositions to certain types of DNA damage. Hence, establishing a database of replication timing profiles for various tissues and their relationship to transcription and other chromosomal properties is a prerequisite for understanding the roles of replication timing in chromosome-based diseases. These roles may extend beyond epigenetic regulation of transcription: the locations and directions of replication forks, the organization of replication complexes that coordinate replication of large domains, and the locations of domain boundaries may constitute an epigenetic basis for tissue-specific or cancer-promoting differences in genome stability.</p><p>Surprisingly few genome-wide studies of replication timing have been performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Early studies in <italic>Drosophila </italic>cells with cDNA arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], or in human cells using BAC arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] did not provide the resolution to define replication domains and their boundaries. A tiling array study of human ENCODE regions covering 1% of the genome was also not able to precisely delineate replication domains, likely because they are typically larger than the 500 kb segments queried by this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Other high-resolution studies of specific chromosome segments in human and <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] also did not delineate domain structure but noted that the relationship between replication timing and transcription was best described at the level of large multi-genic regions rather than individual genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>We have recently mapped replication domain structure genome-wide in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and their differentiated counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We recognized the need for a comprehensive database to display these profiles and compare them between cell lines as well as to other chromosome-wide properties such as transcriptional activity or other epigenetic marks. While this can in principle be done on other public web browsers such as the UCSC Genome Brower <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu"/>, in many cases it is desirable to quickly visualize one's data from individual replicates or using unpublished data in a format that is not appropriate for public viewing. Such comprehensive public databases are becoming complex with the number of tissue and cell-type specific data sets that the reader must browse through. Generally speaking, they are tailored toward the display of static features of chromosomes, rather than dynamic cell-type specific features. Moreover, because of the increasing complexity of genome browsers, viewing large chromosomal regions necessary to visualize replication domains tends to be very slow (e.g. a 5-Mb chromosome segment takes several tens of seconds to display on the UCSC Genome Browser, but 2&#x02013;3 seconds on ReplicationDomain).</p><p>For these reasons, we developed ReplicationDomain as a centralized repository that enables rapid comparative analysis of the genomic landscape for replication domain organization, with the potential to compare these properties to any other genome-wide chromosome data sets, such as those from ChIP-Chip or ChIP-Seq experiments. Our published microarray data sets are publicly available for any non-registered user to view and download. Furthermore, we have implemented a user registration system that allows registered users to upload their own data sets. Users have three options for data security, either to view their data sets privately without sharing (&#x000dc;ber Private), share with other registered users (Private), or make their data sets publicly available on condition that they are published or "in press" in peer-reviewed journals (Public). In the future, we plan to implement additional data security mechanisms that will allow sharing of data sets only with designated registered users. The ability of registered users to upload data sets for private viewing facilitates confidential sharing of data prior to publication, or for quality control checks. ReplicationDomain uses an interactive interface designed to be intuitive for users familiar with the UCSC Genome Browser, with unique features optimized for rapid viewing of multi-megabase domain-wide chromosome properties and the option to jump to the same region of interest in the UCSC Genome Browser. Our recent demonstration of global re-organization of replication domains during ESC differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] predicts that replication profiling will provide a rapid and comprehensive means to evaluate cell-type specific features of global genome organization. ReplicationDomain will provide a valuable resource to consolidate replication profiles, making them more accessible to view and identify cell-type specific properties. We encourage users to begin uploading data sets and suggesting features that will improve this database.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction and content</title><sec><title>Current Contents</title><p>Currently, ReplicationDomain accommodates 10 microarray data sets publicly available without a login requirement. They consist of 7 replication profiles (genome-wide replication timing data) with probes spaced every 5.8 kb for three different mESC lines (D3, TT2 and 46C) either prior to differentiation (indicated ESC) or after differentiation to neural precursor cells (NPCs) either using defined medium in monolayer culture (indicated NPC/ASd6) or in conditioned medium as embryoid bodies (indicated NPC/EBM9), as well as one data set for iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells. One replication timing profile has been performed with probes spaced every 100 bp along regions of chromosome 6 and 7 for undifferentiated mESC line D3. In addition, there are 2 transcription profiles for mESC line D3 and its NPC/EBM9 differentiated counterpart. The details of how these data sets were collected are explained under "Documentation" (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, button 1). Further details and conclusions derived from these data sets are presented in Hiratani et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Briefly, replication-timing data were obtained by hybridizing early and late replication intermediates simultaneously to Nimblegen oligonucleotide arrays containing evenly spaced probes (CGH arrays). The Data Display page shows the log<sub>2 </sub>ratio of early to late replicating intermediates for each probe as a function of its position along the length of any given chromosome. Transcription data were obtained from Affymetrix arrays, using standard methods described under Documentation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, button 1) or in Hiratani et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. What is displayed is a bar, the height of which is the relative signal intensity, and the width of which delineates the start and stop sites of transcription. Gold-colored bars represent genes deemed sufficiently above background to be called "Present" (i.e. expressed) while garnet-colored bars represent genes considered to be "Absent" (i.e. silent) or very lowly expressed. The web site is designed to anticipate any tab-delimited text data file as long as each record indicates the chromosome, start and end nucleotide coordinates, and a data value. Importantly, as long as the file structure follows this format, the data values can derive from any other genome-wide application such as ChIP-Chip, ChIP-Seq, and RNA-Seq.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>ReplicationDomain Main Page</bold>.

Upon upload as tab-delimited text, each data set is parsed and inserted into the database, which can then be queried for data in particular chromosomes, regions, or genes. PHP and HTML scripts are used to connect the user interface and uploaded data sets to the database, which is backed up twice daily to separate hard disk and weekly to tape. The database is hosted on MySQL Server 5.0.51, a multithreaded relational database management system. The Web based user interface, internal administrative interface, administrative scripts, and website statistics are programmed using Apache/2.2.9 (FreeBSD), mod_ssl 2.2.9, OpenSSL 0.9.8e DAV/2, and PHP 5.2.6 with Suhosin-Patch running on a Free BSD version 7.0 64-bit operating system.

It functions similar to other genome browsers, but has unique features that allow one to examine and compare microarray data for replication timing to steady state transcript levels (or any other genome-wide feature) with ease. Data can be downloaded as a tab-delimited text file or saved as a JPEG file for figure assembly. We also provide a link to the UCSC Genome Browser for quick access to additional data for the chromosomal region of interest. Members of the Gilbert lab utilize this site regularly as a tool to mine patterns in the genome indicative of functional changes in chromosome structure during differentiation (see "Downloading data for personal use"). Furthermore, we have implemented a user registration system that allows registered users to upload their own data sets, the details of which can be found under "Creating a ReplicationDomain account" and "Uploading your own data set" below. Regarding unpublished data sets, registered users can either view them privately without sharing or share with other registered users. For published or "in press" data sets, investigators have an option to release them for public access. We can accommodate data sets from any species with a physical genome map, but may need some time to assemble a new navigation path for each new species.</p><sec><title>Database Interface</title><p>ReplicationDomain is freely accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://replicationdomain.org"/>. It provides a novel tool to examine and compare microarray data for replication timing to other chromosomal properties. Different types of data sets can be aligned, by virtue of the dynamically generated graphical output. This unique feature allows investigators to compare replication timing and other chromosomal properties at any region of the genome under different developmental, genetic (e.g. gene knockout cell lines) and/or experimental conditions. Non-registered users may freely view and download public data sets. Registered users with a ReplicationDomain account may upload their own data sets and view them privately or share them with other registered users. Published or "in press" data sets can be added to the series of data sets public available. Further details of these procedures can be found below.</p><sec><title>Getting to a region of interest</title><p>In the near future, species other than the mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) will be available and the user will need to first choose a species and be redirected to the data available for that species, similar to the UCSC Genome Browser.

Your gene will remain at the center as you zoom.</p><p>When you select a region of the chromosome, the Data Display page will display a floating gene name box (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, button 3) in the right column that contains the names and map positions of all genes within the selected region. If there are more than 16 genes, the first and last 8 genes are shown, with the number of genes between them indicated. Pointing your mouse cursor at a gene name will open a hover box that will provide its start and stop positions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, button 4). Further information about this genomic region or the structure of the genes contained within it can be found by clicking the UCSC Genome Browser link (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, button 5).</p></sec><sec><title>Choosing data sets to view</title><p>Data sets on the Data Display page are chosen for viewing much as they are with the UCSC Genome Browser. All data sets are "Hidden" as a default, and can be viewed by using the dropdown menus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, button 6). Relative transcription levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, button 7) can be plotted with either a linear or log scale (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, button 8) while replication-timing data is always plotted as a log<sub>2 </sub>ratio (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, button 9) by choosing "Show" (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, button 10). When these options are selected, graphical display of the data set will show up automatically. The y-axes are adjusted to the highest and lowest values in the entire data set (e.g. for transcription, the height of the y-axis provides an indication of the most highly transcribed gene in that data set). Details of each data set can be found by clicking on their Chip ID on the Data Display page (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Chip ID column) or in the "Database" link in the main menu window (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, button 1).

Then, log in with your ReplicationDomain account (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, button 5), go to the "Database" link from the main menu (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, button 1), click the "Upload data set" link and fill out the form (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) with the requested attributes, select your text data file and hit "send." This should upload your data set, which will appear on the Data Display page for graphical display as well as on the list of data sets found under the "List my data sets" link on the Database page. All of the current 14 data set attributes are described under "<italic>Definitions of Data Entry Terms</italic>" below, which includes Data Security Level (description also on our Documentation page). Users can select Public, Private, or &#x000dc;ber Private. Public data sets can be viewed by any user without a login requirement, but we require such data sets to be published or "in press" in peer-reviewed journals for database quality assurance purposes (i.e. a reference must be provided). Private data sets are viewable by all registered users with a ReplicationDomain account, while &#x000dc;ber Private data sets are viewable only by the registered user who uploaded them. In the future, we anticipate implementing additional data security mechanisms that will allow sharing of data sets among designated registered users. Finally, existing data set attributes including Data Security Level can be edited later if necessary: click the "Database" link from the main menu, identify your data set from "List my data sets" link, hit "Edit," make necessary modifications, and hit "Update."</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Uploading Your Own Data Set</bold>.

Therefore, we have re-defined Chip ID as a string of characters combining individual "Chip ID" numbers and description of the data set identity. Chip ID is not useful except to communicate comments regarding a particular experiment. On the Data Display page, however, the Chip ID for each data set is set up as a link to the "Data Set Details" (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Chip ID column; also accessible from the "Database" link on the main menu).

In addition to providing a consolidated and devoted database, ReplicationDomain provides the opportunity for researchers to share and analyze preliminary data sets with colleagues prior to providing public access. Although not as comprehensive as other databases, ReplicationDomain allows rapid linkage to the UCSC Genome Browser for cross-referencing to other databases. At present, the site contains only data sets collected in the Gilbert laboratory. In the future, we expect to serve as curators of a substantial database, and we expect ReplicationDomain to contain data from other laboratories and for other species, as well as other specific properties that are relevant to higher order domain structure of chromosomes. We invite others to use the web site and to create an account and upload their own data sets so that ReplicationDomain can be used to advance our understanding of the functional significance of a dynamic, developmentally regulated replication-timing program.</p></sec><sec><title>Availability and requirements</title><p>ReplicationDomain is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.replicationdomain.org"/> for use by academic or non-academic users without restriction or charge.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>NW and AS are the web site designers, NW designed and programmed interactive web interface and updates/maintains administrative interface, IH generated the data and consulted in all aspects of the design, TR and TY assisted with implementation of the design and communications between biologists and computer scientists, AS designed hardware and software architecture, designed database structure, designed and programmed administrative interface and scripts, DMG conceived of the project and coordinated all aspects of its development.
