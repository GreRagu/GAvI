Recently, we demonstrated that high concentrations of AA act on <italic>PMP22</italic> gene expression and partially correct the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease phenotype in a mouse model. This is due to the capacity of AA, but not other antioxidants, to down-modulate cAMP intracellular concentration by a competitive inhibition of the adenylate cyclase enzymatic activity. Because of the critical role of cAMP in intracellular signalling, we decided to explore the possibility that ascorbic acid could modulate the expression of other genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Using human pangenomic microarrays, we found that AA inhibited the expression of two categories of genes necessary for cell cycle progression, tRNA synthetases and translation initiation factor subunits. In <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, we demonstrated that AA induced the S-phase arrest of proliferative normal and tumor cells. Highest concentrations of AA leaded to necrotic cell death. However, quiescent cells were not susceptible to AA toxicity, suggesting the blockage of protein synthesis was mainly detrimental in metabolically-active cells. Using animal models, we found that high concentrations of AA inhibited tumor progression in nude mice grafted with HT29 cells (derived from human colon carcinoma). Consistently, expression of tRNA synthetases and ieF2 appeared to be specifically decreased in tumors upon AA treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>AA has an antiproliferative activity, at elevated concentration that could be obtained using IV injection. This activity has been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> as well <italic>in vivo</italic> and likely results from the inhibition of expression of genes involved in protein synthesis. Implications for a clinical use in anticancer therapies will be discussed.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>For a long time, ascorbic acid (AA) has been described as a molecule absolutely required for the integrity and normal life span in mammalians. Most of princeps studies have been derived from the observation on patients suffering from scurvy. Numerous articles have been published demonstrating the necessity of supplement human nutrition with AA, either originating from foods or from nutrition complements. Different biochemical properties have been attributed to AA, essentially in relation with its well-documented antioxidant activity. However, little is known about the effects of AA treatment on gene expression.</p><p>In previous studies we showed that high concentrations of AA down-regulate the cAMP-dependent expression of <italic>PMP22</italic>, partially correcting Charcot-Marie Tooth disease phenotype in mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Passage1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In additional experiments, we demonstrated this action relies on the AA-induced reduction of intracellular pool of cAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Kaya1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, other antioxidants like retinol and &#x003b1;-tocopherol were unable to modulate the pool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Kaya2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, strongly suggesting the inhibitory effect of AA was unrelated to its antioxidant properties. Indeed, we have recently reported that AA is a competitive inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, probably due to partial three-dimensional structures similitude between AA and ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Kaya3">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Because of the critical role of cAMP in the modulation of gene expression, we sought to determine whether other genes could be sensitive to AA treatment. We conducted a series of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments using varying concentrations of AA. We first analyzed the impact on gene expression using human pangenomic microarrays. As we found that several genes implicated in cell proliferation were underexpressed in presence of AA, we further analyzed the effect of AA administration on cell division and tumor progression. Data presented here strongly indicate that AA has an antiproliferative activity, potentially due to the inhibition of expression of genes involved in cell division progression and may be related to its action as a &#x0201c;global regulator&#x0201d; of intracellular cAMP pool.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cells and culture conditions</title><p>The human skin fibroblast cell line was obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository.

Mouse care followed the animal welfare guidelines of our institution, and local animal ethics committee approval was obtained prior to starting the experiments. Four-week-old female BalbC nude mice (Charles River, Lyon, France) (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7 per group) were subcutaneously inoculated with 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> HT29 cells on the right flank. Ten days after implant, and once tumors had reached sizes that could be measured accurately, mice were treated with AA at the following doses: 15 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, or 1,000 mg/kg. Drugs were administered intraperitoneally on a daily basis for 1 month. Tumor size was measured every 2 days in three dimensions using Vernier calipers, and tumor weight (g) was calculated using an ellipsoid shape to approximate the tumor mass: <italic>m</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x003c0;/6&#x000d7;length&#x000d7;width&#x000d7;height.

RNAs were then extracted, reverse transcribed, and hybridized on AGILENT human pangenomic microarrays. RNA samples from untreated cells were labelled with Cy3, and those from treated cells were labelled with Cy5. In a reciprocal experiment, the dye labels were switched, so that untreated cells were labelled with Cy5 and treated cells with Cy3. Genes that were over- or under expressed in the initial screen and behaved in a reciprocal manner in the second screen (e.g., under expressed in the first screen and over expressed in the second screen) were selected and included in a minilibrary. Data were analyzed using Rosetta bioinformatics software. We considered only genes that varied in the same direction (up or down-expression) on all three chips with a <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05. Using these stringent criteria, we found that only a few genes were over expressed in cells incubated with AA, without an obvious biological function. In contrast, 31 genes appeared to be down regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004409.s003">Table S1</xref>).

To determine whether AA had an impact on cell proliferation, we treated the same type of fibroblasts used in microarray assays with increasing concentrations of the drug and monitored the growth curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004409-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). At moderate concentration (0,3 mM), AA partially inhibited cell proliferation. Higher concentrations (0.6 and 2mM) respectively resulted in a cell proliferation arrest or cellular death. We then tested the effect of AA on cell lines derived from human cancers. Cell growth was affected by AA treatment in all of the cell lines, although sensitivity varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004409-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004409.s004">Tables S2</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004409.s005">S3</xref>). This difference is not understood at present. It may be related, at least in part, to varying AA uptake between cell lines since Raji cells, which are the most sensitive cells to AA treatment, also express the highest level of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2) mRNA (data not shown). In addition to the experiments above, we confirmed the effect of AA on cell division using a BrdU incorporation test (data not shown).</p><fig id="pone-0004409-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004409.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Impact of AA treatment on cell growth.</title><p>Growth curves of healthy human fibroblasts (a) or Raji cells (b) incubated with various AA concentrations.

However, with AA doses enable to induce cell death (2 mM and 3 mM), cells continued to die even after the AA-containing medium was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004409-g002">Fig. 2d,e</xref>).</p><p>Cell cycle profiles were analyzed by FACS to determine at which stage of cell division the cells treated with AA were blocked. We noted that 3 mM AA caused a growth arrest during S phase in healthy fibroblasts cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004409-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>) as well as in Raji cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004409-g003">Fig. 3b, c</xref>), with no cells detected in G2/M. In addition, we observed a significant increase in cell death, which we confirmed by trepan blue uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004409-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>). To determine the type of cell death induced by AA treatment, we used flow cytometry on Raji cells, either double labelling with Annexin V (to identify the early apoptotic phase characterized by the external membrane phosphatidylserine translocation) and propidium iodide labelling (to identify plasma membrane permeabilisation related to cell necrosis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004409-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>) or using a TUNEL enzymatic labelling assay of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004409.s001">Fig. S1a</xref>). Nearly all of the cells treated with increasing concentrations of AA became necrotic, without an increase in apoptosis. This was confirmed by the typical swelling and bubbling morphology of the necrotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004409-g004">Fig. 4c, d</xref>). When we treated quiescent cells (human primary fibroblasts at confluence) with the same concentration of AA, there was no effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004409.s001">Fig. S1b</xref>).

A summary is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004409.s006">Table S4</xref>. The exact cause of death in animal cohorts treated either with the lower AA concentration or placebo is not easy to define. However, autopsies of animals sacrificed after 30 days or from spontaneous dead animals, revealed a massive metastatic spread with peritoneal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004409.s002">Fig. S2a and S2b</xref>) as well as peri hepatic carcinosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004409.s002">Fig. S2c</xref>). Therefore, we propose that spontaneous death of animals that have not been treated with the highest dose of AA is due to a highly invasive carcinogenic process that is not observed in animals treated with 1000 mg/days. This suggests that AA could also protect from metastatic invasion, although this hypothesis should be confirmed in further experiments.</p><p>At the end of the treatment period, total RNAs were extracted after tumor dissection, and subjected to RT-qPCR to evaluate the deregulation of the gene expression. Consistently with the data obtained <italic>in vitro</italic>, tRNA synthetase and translation initiation factor subunits genes were under expressed in grafted tumors after AA treatment, in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004409-g005">Fig. 5d</xref>). Hence we demonstrated that AA inhibits the expression of the same genes <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ascorbic acid is most well known as Vitamin C, the nutritional supplement essential for preventing scurvy. The recommended daily dose has varied over time, but it is presently about 75 to 90 mg/day. However, several authors, Linus Pauling among them, have suggested that higher daily doses might prevent cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Pauling1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This has been a hotly debated topic in the scientific community. Although several papers have described the effect of AA on cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Chen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Heckelen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, the antiproliferative effects were always ascribed to the antioxidant properties of AA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Chen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Based on the experiments described in this paper, we propose that AA inhibits cell division and further promotes necrosis by down-modulating the expression of genes necessary for S-phase progression. We found that actively proliferating but not quiescent cells are susceptible to AA treatment, excluding an non-specific toxicity of the highest AA concentrations. It is tempting to speculate the inhibited expression of tRNA synthetases and translation initiation elongation factor subunits leads to the rapid cessation of energy production in proliferating cells, resulting in necrotic cell death.</p><p>We have recently demonstrated that ascorbic acid is a competitive inhibitor of adenylate cyclase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Kaya3">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, resulting in a decrease of intracellular cAMP concentration. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of tRNA synthetase and ieF subunits expression in mammalian cells are still unknown. In particular, the role of cAMP remains to be clarified.</p><p>Few experiments using animal models, with spontaneous tumors, have been performed. These studies, using an oral AA administration, report a decreased mortality for treated animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Pauling2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In humans, clinical trials results are mixed; some studies indicate a benefit to patients treated with AA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Cameron1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, while others do not reveal any beneficial effect following AA treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Moertel1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Assouline1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. We may note that positive trials involved IV injection, in contrast with negative results that involved oral administration. From data presented in this manuscript, it is obvious that treatment with increasing doses of AA induces a specific down regulation of expression of a selected set of genes, resulting in an arrest of cell proliferation and, at higher doses, in cell death.</p><p>Treatment of xenografted animals, either with a placebo or with increasing doses of AA, allowed us to draw some conclusions:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>- Treatment with high doses of AA results in a lowering of tumor progression in terms of tumor weight.</p></list-item><list-item><p>- Xenografted mice treated with the highest AA concentration survive after 40 days (30 days of treatment plus 10 days of grafting). We have no explanation but we observed numerous carcinogenic invasion, in placebo treated animals and in animals treated with lower doses of AA. In contrast, animals treated with 1000 mg/days did not present carcinogenic invasion. It has been described in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Kuwai1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Zirvi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> that HT29 cells are able to form metastatic carcinogenic colonies (in colon and liver).

According to published data from healthy volunteers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004409-Padayatty1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, high concentrations may only be reached by intravenous injection.
