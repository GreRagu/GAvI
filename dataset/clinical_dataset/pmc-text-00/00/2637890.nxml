Differentially expressed genes between p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>and p75<sup>NTR- </sup>cells were determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR.

The percentage of p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>cells was 1.6%&#x02013;3.7% in Eca109 and 3 newly established ESCC cell lines. The expression of Bmi-1, which is associated with self-renewal of stem cells, was significantly higher in p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>cells. p63, a marker identified in keratinocyte stem cells, was confined mainly to p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>cells. The expression of CTR1, which is associated with cisplatin (DDP)-resistance, was significantly decreased in p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>cells. Expression levels of differentiation markers, such as involucrin, cytokeratin 13, &#x003b2;1-integrin and &#x003b2;4-integrin, were lower in p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>cells. In addition, p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>cells generated both p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>and p75<sup>NTR- </sup>cells, and formed nonadherent spherical clusters in serum-free medium supplemented with growth factors. Furthermore, p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>cells were found to be more resistant to DDP and exhibited lower <sup>64</sup>copper accumulation than p75<sup>NTR- </sup>cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrated that p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>cells possess some characteristics of CSCs, namely, self-renewal and chemotherapy resistance.

According to this theory, cancer stem cells (CSCs), which account for a very small proportion of tumor tissue, have the self-renewal property typical of normal stem cells. CSCs rarely divide, but they are able to produce fast-proliferating daughter cells. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of CSCs in a variety of tumors including liver carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], brain tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], breast carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], lung carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], colorectal carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], pancreatic carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and thyroid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition to the basic stem cell properties, CSCs also display high resistance to radiation and conventional chemotherapy. Bao et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] reported that CD133 positive CSCs contributed to glioma radioresistance through preferential activation of DNA damage checkpoint response and increased capacity of DNA repair. Liu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] also reported that CD133 positive CSCs in brain glioblastoma showed strong chemoresistance attributable to higher expression of ABCG2 and MGMT. These studies strongly support the cancer stem cell theory that CSCs are the underlying cause of recurrence and metastasis of tumors.</p><p>Low-affinity neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>), a member of tumor necrosis factor superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], has been shown to paradoxically mediate neuronal survival and differentiation or apoptotic cell death, depending on the environment of the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Okumura et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported that p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>esophageal epithelial cells were stem cells due to their capacity of proliferation, self-renewal and multidirectional differentiation. p75<sup>NTR </sup>was also used for screening mouse testis peritubular smooth muscle precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], rat fat multipotential stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and human corneal epithelial progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present study, we found that p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) cells exhibited properties of CSCs in terms of self-renewal and chemotherapy resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>ESCC specimens and immunohistochemistry</title><p>A total of 100 patients with histopathologically confirmed ESCC who underwent surgery at Changhai Hospital between 2005 and 2006 were selected.

For antigen retrieval, the slides were treated with boiling 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 25 min. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using EnVision&#x02122; Kit (HRP, DAKO Corporation, Denmark). All slides were evaluated independently by two investigators (XHL. and CGB.) without prior knowledge of the clinical information of the patients. The samples were divided into two groups according to the percentage of p75<sup>NTR </sup>staining-positive cells, tumors were classified as positive if &#x0003e;10% tumor cells were stained and negative if &#x02264; 10% tumor cells were stained[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Although statistical analysis showed that positive rate of p75<sup>NTR </sup>was not associated with lower pathological grade, histopathological analysis indicated that the number and distribution of p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>cells altered depending on the degree of anaplasia in ESCC. In WDC, p75<sup>NTR </sup>was confined to the surrounding basal-like cells which were at some distance from the centers of terminal differentiation. In MDC, the number of p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>cells increased and their distribution became irregular with respect to the centers of terminal differentiation. In PDC, p75<sup>NTR </sup>was diffusely distributed and there was virtually no relation between the distribution of p75<sup>NTR+ </sup>cells and the small zones of terminal differentiation. Thus, both in NEE and ESCC, p75<sup>NTR </sup>was mainly expressed in immature cells. Ki-67, a cell proliferation-associated nuclear antigen, was found in all stages of the cell cycle. Immunostaining for p75<sup>NTR </sup>and ki-67 revealed that only a small proportion of p75<sup>NTR+</sup>cells expressed ki-67 in NEE, while the number of cancer cells coexpressing p75<sup>NTR </sup>and ki-67 increased in ESCC. These results suggested that p75<sup>NTR </sup>was expressed in cells that were proliferating or capable of proliferating.
