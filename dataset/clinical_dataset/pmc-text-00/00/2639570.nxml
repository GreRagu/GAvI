It is caused by larvae of animal hookworms. Ancylostoma braziliense is the most common offender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The disease is endemic in resource-poor communities in the developing world, particularly in Brazil, India, and the West Indies. It occurs sporadically or in the form of small epidemics in high-income countries and is reported in tourists who have visited the tropics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Most often, people pick up the infection by walking through contaminated areas barefoot or with open-type shoes, or by sitting in tainted soil or sand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The main affected areas are the dorsum and sole of the feet (uni and bilateral), buttocks, pelvic waist, legs and shoulders. More than one lesion is compatible with more than one entry point. The main signs and symptoms are linear and/or serpiginous lesions (which progress from 2&#x02013;3 mm to 2&#x02013;3 cm per day) and the pruritus. This is intensified after some days by the inflammatory reaction of the host and may even interfere with sleep. Pain may occur in papulovesicular lesions. Systemic signs include peripheral eosinophilia (Loeffler syndrome), migratory pulmonary infiltrates, and increased immunoglobulin E levels, but are rarely seen.</p><p>The diagnosis of hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans is easily made clinically on the basis of typical clinical presentation which is a pruritic serpiginous lesion that advances in a patient with a history of sunbathing, walking barefoot on the beach, or similar activity in a tropical location. Creeping eruption as a clinical sign is diagnostic; a biopsy is not useful.</p><p>Even though the condition is self-limited, the intense pruritus and risk for infection mandate treatment. Different therapeutic approaches are effective: a single dose of ivermectin (200 &#x003bc;g per kg bodyweight) kills the migrating larvae effectively and relieves itching quickly. Oral albendazole (400 mg daily), given for 5&#x02013;7 days, shows excellent cure rates and the drug is well-tolerated by patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thiabendazole (50 mg per kg bodyweight for 2&#x02013;4 days) was widely used after the first report of its efficacy in 1963. However, given orally the substance is poorly tolerated, and frequently causes dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and intestinal cramps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Topical thiabendazole 10% cream, although less effective, is a good alternative for young children to avoid the potential side effects of systemic medications.</p><p>The prognosis is excellent. This is a self-limiting disease. Humans are accidental, dead-end hosts, with the larva dying and the lesions resolving within 4&#x02013;8 weeks, as long as 1 year in rare cases.</p><p>In prevention, when visiting tropical countries, especially beaches and sandy, moist areas, it is best to wear shoes that completely cover the feet. Also, one should avoid sitting or lying on bare sand, even if on a towel. Deworming of pets is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.
