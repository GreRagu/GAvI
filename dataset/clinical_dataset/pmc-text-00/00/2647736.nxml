Cross-resistance to knockdown agents, which are mainly used in mosquito coils and related products as spatial repellents, is the most serious concern. Since cross-resistance is a global phenomenon, we have started to monitor the distribution of mosquito resistance to pyrethroids. The first pilot study was carried out in Vietnam. We periodically drove along the national road from the north end to the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and collected mosquito larvae from used tires. Simplified susceptibility tests were performed using the fourth instar larvae of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, and <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>. Compared with the other species, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> demonstrated the most prominent reduction in susceptibility. For <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, significant increases in the susceptibility indices with a decrease in the latitude of collection points were observed, indicating that the susceptibility of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> against <italic>d</italic>-allethrin was lower in the southern part, including mountainous areas, as compared to that in the northern part of Vietnam. There was a significant correlation between the susceptibility indices in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and the sum of annual pyrethroid use for malaria control (1998&#x02013;2002). This might explain that the use of pyrethroids as residual treatment inside houses and pyrethroid-impregnated bed nets for malaria control is attributable to low pyrethroid susceptibility in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Such insecticide treatment appeared to have been intensively administered in the interior and along the periphery of human habitation areas where, incidentally, the breeding and resting sites of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are located.

However, extensive treatment of photo-stable and highly effective pyrethroids sometimes causes resistance to insect populations. Resistance to pyrethroids belonging to the knockdown agent groups that have been used as the spatial repellents, such as mosquito coils and related products, is the most serious concern. Since this is a global phenomenon, we have started to monitor the distribution of mosquito resistance to pyrethroids and the first pilot study was carried out in Vietnam. Our study concluded that <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, the most important vector of dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever, demonstrated the prominent reduction in susceptibility against <italic>d</italic>-allethrin, one of the most popular pyrethroids for spatial repellents. The extensive treatment of photo-stable pyrethroids for malaria control seemed to be one of the attributable factors. In order to effectively manage pyrethroid resistance, the establishment of a feasible insecticide management system and a regular monitoring system of pyrethroid susceptibility will be essential.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the most successful events in the development of pesticide chemicals was the discovery of pyrethrum and the successful synthesis of pyrethroids. For example, allethrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000391-Schechter1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, a classical synthetic pyrethroid, continues to be used for preventing mosquito bites without any toxicological and operational problems. There are two main groups of pyrethroids: one possessing high knockdown activity but low killing activity and the other possessing high killing activity. The pyrethroids in the former group, such as <italic>d</italic>-allethrin, are aptly labeled as knockdown agents, and those in the latter group, as killing agents. Generally, the pyrethroids belonging to the latter group exhibit high photostability that enables their outdoor use, for example, as agricultural pesticides. Nowadays, photo-stable pyrethroids are emerging as the predominant insecticides for vector control. In fact, photo-stable pyrethroids comprise 40&#x00025; of the insecticides used annually on a global level for indoor residual spraying against malaria vectors and 100&#x00025; of the WHO-recommended insecticides for the treatment of mosquito nets. The exception is the use of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in African countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000391-Zaim1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Pyrethroid resistance to photo-stable pyrethroids is envisioned to be a major problem for the vector control program since, at present, there are no chemical substitutes for pyrethroids. Moreover, cross-resistance to knockdown agents is the most serious concern. Since this is a global phenomenon, we have started to monitor the distribution of mosquito resistance to pyrethroids. The first pilot study was carried out in Vietnam. In the course of the National Dengue Control Program in Vietnam, the ecological differences between two dengue vectors, namely, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (L.) and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (Skuse), that are of different geographical origins have become a subject of discussion. The ecological differences in the vectors may be the reason for the differences in the epidemics occurring nationwide. In order to examine the nationwide distribution of the two species and pyrethroid resistance, used tires, one of the main breeding grounds of the two species, were targeted for larval collection. Used tires were suitable targets for our study as a standard breeding sites because they were extensively and commonly distributed along roads in Vietnam. In the present paper, distribution analysis of pyrethroid-susceptibility of the larvae of three major mosquito species, namely, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, and <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (Say), that were collected from used tires located along the national road in Vietnam was carried out. The relationships between pyrethroid susceptibility and the geographical factors and province based annual pyrethroid use are also discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Collection of mosquito larvae from used tires</title><p>We periodically drove along the national road from the north end to the Mekong Delta in Vietnam (7&#x02013;16 December 2006; 17&#x02013;20 March, 15&#x02013;20 May, and 1&#x02013;12 July 2007; and 7&#x02013;16 January 2008) and collected mosquito larvae from used tires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000391-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

After releasing the larva, 32 or 8 microliters of the solution was added in each vial to obtain a concentration of 0.4 and 0.1 ppm, respectively. Twenty larvae from each site were used for each concentration regime. Knockdown of the larvae was observed for 30 min. Larvae that sank to the bottom of the glass vial and could not swim, float, or were paralyzed were judged as knocked down larvae; the time to knockdown was recorded for each larva. After the test, each larva was placed in a 1.5 ml plastic vial containing ethanol solution for identification at a later time.

However, it was impossible for us to follow this procedure since 190 field-collected larval samples were acquired in the present study. Susceptibility tests were, therefore, performed on the day of collection according to a simplified protocol by using the fourth instar larvae. In many cases, the adult susceptibility scores correlated with the larval susceptibility scores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000391-Kawada1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000391-Nazni1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. This is, however, not always true for all cases since mosquitoes might develop different resistant mechanisms with different metabolic pathways in the larval and adult stages.

The most prominent observation is that the susceptibility of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to <italic>d</italic>-allethrin decreased significantly with decrease in the latitude of the collection points. Vu et al. reported similar tendency in pyrethroid susceptibility in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in Vietnam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000391-Vu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

They concluded this discrepancy in pyrethroid susceptibility in different regions to be due to the longer and extended use of pyrethroids in malaria and dengue fever control programs and in agriculture in the Southern and Central Highlands. Actually, a lot of pyrethroids have been treated as residual treatment inside houses and pyrethroid-impregnated bed nets for malaria control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000391-g005">Figure 5</xref>) as a part of the National Malaria Control Program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000391-Verl1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000391-Hung1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000391-Nam1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, since the abandoning of DDT sprays in 1995, only pyrethroids (residual spraying of &#x003bb;-cyhalothrin and &#x003b1;-cypermethrin and occasionally deltamethrin, and permethrin-impregnated bed nets) have been extensively used in large amounts, unlike in the other Asian countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000391-Zaim1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000391-Nam1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Although details regarding the amount of insecticides used for dengue control in Vietnam have not been published, 21,000 liters of photo-stable pyrethroid formulations such as &#x003bb;-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, and permethrin was reported to be used for dengue control in 20 southern provinces in 2007 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000391-Epidemiological1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The extensive use of photo-stable pyrethroids, therefore, seems to have been very common in southern Vietnam.</p><p>Insecticides still provide the most promising countermeasures for controlling malaria, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and other arthropod-borne diseases. On an average, at the global level, 547 tones of DDT, 39 tones of organophosphates, 23 tones of carbamates, and 41 tones of pyrethroids are used as active ingredients annually for indoor residual spraying against malaria vectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000391-Zaim1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The average total amount of pyrethroids used annually as active ingredients between 2003 and 2005 at the global level was 161 tones, which is 16&#x00025; of the total insecticide consumption and 36&#x00025; of the total insecticide consumption if the amount of DDT, which is exclusively used in African countries, is excluded. Among pyrethroids that are used for vector control, 98.7&#x00025; comprise photo-stable pyrethroids such as &#x003b1;-cypermethrin, cypermethrin, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, etofenprox, &#x003bb;-cyhalothrin, and permethrin.</p><p>On the other hand, the most popular and long-standing formulations using pyrethroids are mosquito coils, mosquito mats, and liquid vaporizers. Pyrethroids belonging to the knockdown agent group, such as allethrin, pyrethrin, and prallethrin, are used in these formulations. In particular, <italic>d</italic>-allethrin still continues to be used in these types of formulations.

Several factors are believed to play major roles in inducing pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes. The most serious factor is the uncontrolled use of photo-stable pyrethroids. Photo-stable pyrethroids persist on substrates such as wall and floor surfaces for long periods and hence continue to kill insects that make contact with these substrates. This induces a strong selection pressure on the insect population resulting in a population of resistant offspring. Ultra-low volume (ULV) space sprays are commonly applied for the emergency control of dengue vectors in urban areas. Space sprays by themselves do not induce a very strong selection pressure; however, uncontrolled treatment at high frequency facilitates the development of resistance. In the past, the use of pyrethroids in aqueous environments was impossible since pyrethroids are highly toxic to aqueous organisms. However, recently, a new pyrethroid with low fish toxicity has been commercially produced and is widely used in aqueous environments such as paddy fields. This might cause considerable selection pressure on the mosquito larvae distributed in such environments. The discovery of the phenoxybenzyl alcohol moiety accelerated the development of photo-stable pyrethroids that could be used for agricultural purposes. These &#x0201c;second generation&#x0201d; pyrethroids have been used worldwide as good vector control agents with various application techniques such as residual spraying, ULV spraying, and bed net treatment (long-lasting insecticide-treated net &#x0005b;LLITN&#x0005d;). However, photo-stable and highly effective pyrethroids might accelerate the development of pyrethroid resistance in mosquito populations. The most serious problem is that resistance to a single pyrethroid causes cross-resistance to all other pyrethroids, including knockdown agents. In fact, many reports concerning pyrethroid resistance have emerged after the successful application of pyrethroids as vector control agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000391-African1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the uncontrolled use of such pyrethroids might lead to the end of the golden age of pyrethroids.</p><p>Humans have invented insecticides to ensure comfort and to achieve ideal conditions. Good insecticides, therefore, should be as effective as possible so that the abovementioned goals are realized. However, the development and manufacturing costs of insecticides should be as low as possible. It is, therefore, our duty to use insecticides in the most effective and prudent manner possible in order to maintain their effectiveness and sustain their use. In order to effectively manage pyrethroid resistance, the establishment of a feasible insecticide management system and a regular monitoring system of pyrethroid susceptibility will be essential. Moreover, it is expected that the use of photo-unstable knockdown agents as spatial repellents, which effectively interfere with disease transmission without causing any selection pressure to insect populations, will be reconsidered.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank D.
