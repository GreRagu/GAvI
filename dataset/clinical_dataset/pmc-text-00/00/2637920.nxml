All molecular assays target the viral 5&#x02032;-noncoding region (5&#x02032;-NCR), and all show genotype-dependent variation of sensitivities and viral load results. Non-western HCV genotypes have been under-represented in evaluation studies. An alternative diagnostic target region within the HCV genome could facilitate a new generation of assays.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>In this study we determined by de novo sequencing that the 3&#x02032;-X-tail element, characterized significantly later than the rest of the genome, is highly conserved across genotypes. To prove its clinical utility as a molecular diagnostic target, a prototype qualitative and quantitative test was developed and evaluated multicentrically on a large and complete panel of 725 clinical plasma samples, covering HCV genotypes 1&#x02013;6, from four continents (Germany, UK, Brazil, South Africa, Singapore). To our knowledge, this is the most diversified and comprehensive panel of clinical and genotype specimens used in HCV nucleic acid testing (NAT) validation to date. The lower limit of detection (LOD) was 18.4 IU/ml (95&#x00025; confidence interval, 15.3&#x02013;24.1 IU/ml), suggesting applicability in donor blood screening. The upper LOD exceeded 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> IU/ml, facilitating viral load monitoring within a wide dynamic range. In 598 genotyped samples, quantified by Bayer VERSANT 3.0 branched DNA (bDNA), X-tail-based viral loads were highly concordant with bDNA for all genotypes. Correlation coefficients between bDNA and X-tail NAT, for genotypes 1&#x02013;6, were: 0.92, 0.85, 0.95, 0.91, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively; X-tail-based viral loads deviated by more than 0.5 log10 from 5&#x02032;-NCR-based viral loads in only 12&#x00025; of samples (maximum deviation, 0.85 log10). The successful introduction of X-tail NAT in a Brazilian laboratory confirmed the practical stability and robustness of the X-tail-based protocol. The assay was implemented at low reaction costs (US$8.70 per sample), short turnover times (2.5 h for up to 96 samples), and without technical difficulties.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study indicates a way to fundamentally improve HCV viral load monitoring and infection screening.

HCV&#x02014;a leading cause of chronic hepatitis (inflammation of the liver)&#x02014;is spread through contact with the blood of an infected person. Globally, the main routes of transmission are the use of unscreened blood for transfusions and the reuse of inadequately sterilized medical instruments, including needles. In affluent countries, where donated blood is routinely screened for the presence of HCV, most transmission is through needle sharing among drug users. The risk of sexual and mother-to-child transmission of HCV is low. Although HCV infection occasionally causes an acute (short-lived) illness characterized by tiredness and jaundice (yellow eyes and skin), most newly infected people progress to a symptom-free, chronic infection that can eventually cause liver cirrhosis (scarring) and liver cancer. HCV infections can be treated with a combination of two drugs called interferon and ribavirin, but these drugs are expensive and are ineffective in many patients.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>An effective way to limit the global spread of HCV might be to introduce routine screening of the blood that is used for transfusions in developing countries. In developed countries, HCV screening of blood donors use expensive, commercial &#x0201c;RT-PCR&#x0201d; assays to detect small amounts of HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA; HCV stores the information it needs to replicate itself&#x02014;its genome&#x02014;as a sequence of &#x0201c;ribonucleotides&#x0201d;). All the current HCV assays, which can also quantify the amount of viral RNA in the blood (the viral load) during treatment, detect a target sequence in the viral genome called the 5&#x02032;-noncoding region (5&#x02032;-NCR). However, there are several different HCV &#x0201c;genotypes&#x0201d; (strains). These genotypes vary in their geographical distribution and, even though the 5&#x02032;-NCR sequence is very similar (highly conserved) in the common genotypes (HCV genotypes 1&#x02013;6), the existing assays do not detect all the variants equally well. This shortcoming, together with their high cost, means that 5&#x02032;-NCR RT-PCR assays are not ideal for use in many developing countries. In this study, the researchers identify an alternative diagnostic target sequence in the HCV genome&#x02014;the 3&#x02032;-X-tail element&#x02014;and ask whether this sequence can be used to develop a new generation of tests for HCV infection that might be more appropriate for use in developing countries.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers determined the RNA sequence of the 3&#x02032;-X-tail element in reference samples of the major HCV genotypes and showed that this region of the HCV genome is as highly conserved as the 5&#x02032;-NCR. They then developed a prototype X-tail RT-PCR assay and tested its ability to detect small amounts of HCV and to measure viral load in genotype reference samples and in a large panel of HCV-infected blood samples collected in Germany, the UK, Brazil, South Africa, and Singapore. The new assay detected low levels of HCV RNA in all of the genotype reference samples and was also able to quantify high RNA concentrations. The viral load estimates it provided for the clinical samples agreed well with those obtained using a commercial assay irrespective of the sample's HCV genotype. Finally, the X-tail RT-PCR assay gave similar results to a standard assay at a fraction of the cost when used to measure viral loads in a Brazilian laboratory in an independent group of 127 patient samples collected in Brazil.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings suggest that the HCV 3&#x02032;-X-tail element could provide an alternative target for screening blood samples for HCV infection and for monitoring viral loads during treatment, irrespective of HCV genotype. In addition, they suggest that X-tail RT-PCR assays may be stable and robust enough for use in laboratories in emerging countries. Overall, these findings should stimulate the development of a new generation of clinical HCV assays that, because the protocol used in the X-tail assay is freely available, could improve blood safety in developing countries by providing a cheap and effective alternative to existing proprietary HCV assays.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000031">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000031</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The World Health Organization has a fact sheet about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164">hepatitis C</ext-link> (in English and French)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/ChooseC.htm">hepatitis C</ext-link> for the public and for health professionals (information is also available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/spanish/enfermedades/Hepatitis/HepatitisC.htm">Spanish</ext-link>)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases provides basic information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/hepc_ez">hepatitis C</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus Encyclopedia has a page on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/MEDLINEPLUS/ency/article/000284.htm">hepatitis C</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hepatitisc.html">MedlinePlus</ext-link> also provides links to further information on hepatitis C (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Drexler JF, Kupfer B, Petersen N, Grotto RMT, Rodrigues SMC, et al.

Diagnostic detection of HCV RNA identifies an infection weeks to months before a detectable antibody response. To prevent transmission by transfusion of viremic blood, nucleic acid testing (NAT) of blood donors has become a routine procedure in industrialized countries.

This region is thought to be the most conserved portion of the HCV genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; and is targeted by all assays. Test manufacturers have made substantial efforts to optimize 5&#x02032;-NCR target sites, keeping them unpublished for all current commercial assays. Still, there seem to be remaining issues with these tests, as exemplified by the discontinuation of a new real-time PCR-based assay in 2004 after initial introduction in blood screening &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. One of the most important issues may be the existence of complex secondary structures due to the 5&#x02032;-NCR's function as an internal ribosomal entry site for genome translation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. These secondary structures may interfere in complex ways with primer or probe binding.</p><p>Due to notorious problems with the 5&#x02032;-NCR, a different target region would be beneficial. However, viral genes downstream of the 5&#x02032;-NCR are not useful as diagnostic targets because of their nucleotide variability &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. In the mid 1990s, molecular biology studies on the HCV replication cycle revealed that the genome carries an additional element in its 3&#x02032;-UTR downstream of the poly-U tract, the so-called X-tail &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. The biological function of the X-tail is not completely understood, but it has been shown that it is involved in several crucial steps throughout the HCV life cycle, involving both RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b035">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.

It may be due to lack of available sequence information across all genotypes that the X-tail has been neglected as a diagnostic target so far. In this study we explored its utility for HCV detection and quantification by sequencing the X-tail from a broad and complete panel of HCV genotypes. To assess its diagnostic utility, we then developed an X-tail-based viral load assay that fulfills the same technical standards as commercial assays currently in clinical use. Clinical validation involved 725 stored samples across HCV genotypes 1&#x02013;6 from patients from four continents (Germany, UK, South Africa, Singapore, and Brazil).

Its biological functions are now becoming clearer, and it is likely that its role in the virus life cycle involves both RNA and protein interactions. The three X-tail stem-loop structures (SL1&#x02013;3) seem to be involved in negative-strand synthesis and significantly enhance HCV replication by means of binding to ribosomal and other cellular proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b035">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.

Initially we could not be sure about its utility for several reasons implied by its biological functions. A possible limitation could have been its position at the end of the genome and beyond the poly-U tract, making the X-tail prone to nuclease degradation. Moreover, due to its functions as a 3&#x02032;-element it could have been associated strongly with viral or cellular proteins.

The genotype-related robustness of the prototype X-tail assay was at least equivalent with that of proprietary assays &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;. Quantitative correlation and lower limits of detection were highly consistent for all genotypes by X-tail RT-PCR. The lower LOD (18.4 IU/ml) and the upper quantification range of our assay (&#x0003e;189,000,000 IU/ml) were equivalent to that of the last generation Roche COBAS TaqMan HCV test and the Abbott HCV RealTime assay &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. Critically, X-tail-based viral loads and bDNA results were highly congruent, making the assay compatible with other quantification systems. This compatibility is critical when patients switch their treating institution, which may entail switching between viral load tests. The observed quantitative deviations were generally &#x0003c;0.5 log10, i.e., below clinical relevance.</p><p>In resource-limited settings our prototype assay could be used instead of more costly proprietary assays in HCV treatment and testing. It is not patented, has a simple and accessible formulation (refer to the bench protocol and instructions for requesting controls in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-1000031-sd007">Text S3</xref>), and is appropriate for rare HCV genotypes. Several less-affluent countries have established successful HIV treatment programs, but suffer from considerable HCV prevalence as well. One important example is Brazil, where networks of well-managed public laboratories conduct viral load testing as a part of the national HIV-1 treatment program &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. Intensive efforts have been made to develop low-cost viral load assays for HIV-1 in Brazil and elsewhere &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b024">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. The most important issue with such in-house assays is their robustness. In proprietary commercial assays robustness is contributed by advanced features like automated RNA preparation, nuclease resistant calibrators, and synthetic internal controls. We have incorporated all of these features in the open protocol HCV X-tail assay. A second issue in using in-house assays is quality control, which is shifted largely to the production process in commercial kits, but can be managed at the laboratory level if appropriate quality control procedures are in place. In the context of HIV viral load monitoring, we and others have demonstrated that in-house testing in emerging countries is feasible in well-managed laboratories &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. The potential for translation of the assay was demonstrated by implementation in a Brazilian laboratory and on-site comparison against the Bayer bDNA assay. X-tail RT-PCR had short turnover times (2.5 h for up to 96 samples) and was implemented from provided protocols without technical difficulties. Overall results suggest that X-tail RT-PCR is suitable for the Brazilian setting, even though genotyping was not feasible at the study site. The overall HCV genotype distribution in S&#x000e3;o Paulo state is known to be approximately 65&#x00025;, 5&#x00025;, and 30&#x00025; of genotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. Reaction costs of the assay ranged around US$8.70 per sample, or 8.1&#x00025; of the current viral load costs in Brazil. It should be mentioned that under European conditions, an additional service license fee would apply, increasing the cost of one assay to US$18 per sample (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1000031-t003">Table 3</xref> for an estimation of costs).</p><table-wrap id="pmed-1000031-t003" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Approximate Pricing of HCV Viral Load Assays, US Dollars, without Taxes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.1000031.t003"/></table-wrap><p>Finally, HCV is an important issue for blood safety in emerging countries. Again, Brazil provides an example representative of many other emerging countries. An urgent federal decree in 2003 demanded the general testing of donated blood for HCV by NAT &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;, but this strategy has not yet been implemented. According to estimates by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, it would cost about US$40 million to screen 4 million blood donations annually &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b062">62</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We previously demonstrated the feasibility of in-house testing of blood donors for HCV by NAT methods &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;. Due to the high sensitivity of X-tail RT-PCR (18.4 IU/ml), the prototype assay could be used for testing pooled blood donor samples. With the well-established approach of pooling 24 donors prior to NAT testing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;, the projected LOD would be 441 IU/ml per donor (18.4 IU/ml &#x000d7; 24). This projection would match the sensitivity achieved with pooled blood donor screening in Europe &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d; and North America &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000031-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;. Calculating the cost for one X-tail NAT assay at US$10 (US$8.70 for RT-PCR according to <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1000031-t003">Table 3</xref>, plus US$1.30 for extra consumables due to pooling), and assuming 20&#x00025; additional costs for controls and confirmatory testing, 24-donor pool testing by X-tail RT-PCR would amount to US$2 million per 4 million donations annually (4 million/24 &#x000d7; US$10 &#x000d7; 1.2). This means a reduction down to 5&#x00025; of the current economic estimate. In view of the technical robustness and transferability of the assay described in this report, we believe that such a strategy could be a realistic approach in emerging countries aiming to increase blood safety through the introduction of HCV NAT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"
