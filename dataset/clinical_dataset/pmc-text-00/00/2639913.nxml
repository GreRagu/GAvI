The model incorporates a feedback mechanism regulating the production of T lymphocytes and simulates the dynamics of CD8 + lymphocytes, whose production is assumed to be closely linked to that of CD4 + cells. Because CD4 + lymphocyte counts are a good prognostic indicator of HIV infection, the model was used to simulate such therapeutic interventions as chemotherapy and active and passive immunization. The model also simulated the therapeutic administration of anti-CD8 antibodies; this intervention was assumed to activate T-cell production by activating a feedback mechanism blocked by the high numbers of CD8 + lymphocytes present in HIV-infected persons. The character and implications of the model are discussed in the context of other mathematical models used in HIV infection.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
