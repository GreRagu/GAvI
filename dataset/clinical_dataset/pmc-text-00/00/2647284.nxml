We designed a selection system in which two RNAs, a target RNA and a RNA pool, were assembled by employing a pre-organized GAAA tetraloop-11-nt receptor interaction. This allows us to select the binding sequence against a targeted internal loop as well as a linker region optimized for binding of the two binding sites. After the selection, the aptamers bound with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range, thereby forming a stable complex with the target RNA. Thus this method enables identification of aptamers for a specific binding site together with a linker for cooperative binding of the two RNAs. It appears that our new method can be applied generally to select RNAs that adhere tightly to a target RNA via two specific sites. The method can also be applicable for further engineering of both natural and artificial RNAs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Functional RNA such as ribozyme requires specific tertiary interaction(s) for the folding and fixation of its 3D structure into one particular form. It is therefore crucial to consider specific RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions when designing and constructing artificial RNA architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). Many tertiary interactions involving both Watson&#x02013;Crick and non-Watson&#x02013;Crick base-pairings have been identified in natural RNAs, and have also been seen in artificial RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, only limited numbers of these interactions have been thoroughly analyzed at the atomic level, despite the fact that a variety of interactive motifs with known 3D structures are needed as &#x02018;molecular parts&#x02019; when constructing artificial RNA architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). This problem is attributable in part to the difficulty of analyzing the tertiary structures of RNAs, but also to limitations of the technique used to identify new components for RNA construction. Thus artificial RNA interactive motifs (aptamers) that bind to target RNAs are required to build desired RNA architectures.</p><p>At present, an <italic>in vitro</italic> selection technique is being used to select aptamers against target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">7&#x02013;15</xref>). A number of aptamers that specifically bind to target RNAs have been identified using this approach, and these have proved very useful in areas of medical engineering and biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). With this technique, however, the aptamer binding site on the target RNA usually cannot be predicted prior to the selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, top). This is a significant drawback, especially when an aptamer for a particular site on the target RNA is wanted. Moreover, most RNA&#x02013;RNA tertiary interactions such as tetraloop&#x02013;receptor binding are weak&#x02014;e.g. the naturally occurring GAAA tetraloop-11-nt receptor interaction has a dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) in the millimolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Nonetheless, such weak interactions are employed in naturally occurring RNAs: Functional RNAs adapt a set of interactive motifs that reinforce a weak binding for fixing global RNA architectures. It is thus conceivable that the combined use of the weak interactions is favorable for designing and constructing functional RNAs, because it establishes tight and specific binding of the RNAs intramolecularly and intermolecularly.<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of the selection strategy. (<bold>A</bold>) The general selection strategy (top) and our strategy (bottom) used to obtain RNA-targeted aptamers. In general, the RNA pool consists of random sequences flanked by constant sequences for primer hybridization. This tends to produce an aptamer that binds to the entire loop region of the target molecule or to an unexpected binding site because the binding to a single target site is often too weak to be selected. It is technically difficult to isolate aptamers that weakly bind to the target. With our selection strategy, two RNA molecules were associated based on their molecular design. In addition to increasing the affinity, because of cooperativity between the two binding sites, it can structurally restrict the target site. (<bold>B</bold>) Left: secondary structures of type B RNA, an artificially designed self-folding RNA. GAAA/loop-11-nt receptor interaction and triple helical scaffolding are shown in blue and purple, respectively. Right: DSL, design and selected ligase. The selected ligase module is shown in red. (<bold>C</bold>) Left: secondary structures of pool RNA and the target RNA (loop B-GAAA). The GAAA tetraloop and 11-nt receptor are shown in blue, and the blue dotted line indicates the interaction between them. The sequences of loop B are colored in red.

Colored regions correspond to those in the secondary structure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn1012f1"/></fig></p><p>Based on this combinatorial effect, we developed a method for <italic>in vitro</italic> selection of aptamers that cooperatively bind to two specific sites within a target RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, bottom). The strategy is based on our earlier work in which we employed a self-folding RNA of known structure (Type B RNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, left) to design and construct a ligase ribozyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Type B RNA consists of standard double-stranded helices connected via a tetraloop&#x02013;receptor interaction and consecutive base triples that fix the relative orientation of two stems, P1 and P3. A reaction site for RNA&#x02013;RNA ligation and a pool of 30 random nucleotides were designed and introduced at the P1 and P3 stems, respectively, after which we selected an RNA ligase (DSL) from the pool, which was situated in close proximity to the putative reaction site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, right).</p><p>Our strategy for obtaining modular aptamers with a desired interactive motif depends on a known RNA&#x02013;RNA interaction. In the selection system, the two RNAs, a target RNA and an RNA possessing a pool, are assembled via a loop&#x02013;receptor interaction for the purpose of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Thus after the selection, two RNAs should be connected via two interactions, the known loop&#x02013;receptor interaction and a newly selected interaction. We postulated that the coordinated two interactions would dramatically enhance the stability and specificity between two RNAs, even though a newly selected interaction by itself was too weak to form a stable complex with the target RNA. In other words, the binding affinity for the two RNAs should become sufficient to dock the targeted RNA.</p><p>With that in mind, we designed a model system by employing a pre-organized GAAA tetraloop-11-nt receptor interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). This enabled us to select the binding sequence against a targeted internal loop and to optimize the linker region between the two binding sites in the target RNA. Although the binding affinity of the newly selected motif for the target was, by itself, very weak (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0003e; 1 &#x003bc;M), the selected aptamer RNA formed a stable complex with the target RNA via two cooperative interactions that were assisted by the selected linker. This method thus provides aptamer(s) for a designed target site and an optimized linker region for cooperative binding of two RNAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Molecular design for the targeted selection</title><p>Pool RNA containing 30 random sequences was derived from the P3 stem of Type B RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), while loop B-GAAA was derived from WT-34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The apical GUGA loop of WT-34 was replaced with a GAAA loop to enable interaction between the two molecules, and two base pairs located at the bottom of WT-34 were deleted to facilitate synthesis.

The total volume of the reaction mixture and concentrations of the pool RNA, target RNA and competitor loop B-UUCG were listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Pool RNA dissolved in water was incubated for 3 min at 80&#x000b0;C, cooled on ice for 1 min and then incubated for 5 min at 25&#x000b0;C. Thereafter, 10-fold concentrated R buffer was added to the solution, which was then incubated for 5 min at 25&#x000b0;C. For the first round of selection, pool RNA was mixed for 20 min with streptavidine beads (Promega, USA) previously washed three times with R buffer to exclude candidates that bind to the beads (counter-selection). RNA candidates not retained by the beads were then mixed with biotinylated target RNA for 20 min. For the 2&#x02013;11 rounds of selection, pool RNA was directly mixed with the target RNA without counter-selection, after which streptavidine beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for additional 10 min at 25&#x000b0;C. Unbound RNA was then removed, and the beads were washed twice by R buffer. The bound candidates were eluted from the target RNA by heating for 40 s at 75&#x000b0;C in 50 &#x003bc;l of water (rounds 1&#x02013;5) or 50 &#x003bc;l of 10 mM EDTA (rounds 6&#x02013;11). The eluted candidates were reverse transcribed using Rever Tra Ace (Toyobo, Japan) with reverse primer R-c and amplified by PCR with primers R-a and R-c. For rounds 6&#x02013;11, loop B-UUCG was added prior to the addition of target RNA to serve as a competitor. For the characterization of selected aptamers, DNA templates after 5th and 11th rounds were cloned into pGEM vector (Promega, USA), and then 14 and 41 clones were sequenced, respectively.<table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>The condition of <italic>in vitro</italic> selection experiment</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cycle</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">RNA pool</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Loop B-GAAA (target RNA)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Loop B-UUCG (competitor)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">% Captured</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total volume</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 nmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.9<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF1"><sup>a</sup></xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 ml</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6<sup>a</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 &#x003bc;l</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.5<sup>a</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 &#x003bc;l</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.5<sup>a</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 &#x003bc;l</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">500 &#x003bc;l</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 &#x003bc;l</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 &#x003bc;l</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 &#x003bc;l</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 &#x003bc;l</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 &#x003bc;l</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 pmol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 &#x003bc;l</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF1"><p><sup>a</sup>Maximum value of fraction captured was 10%.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs)</title><p>The formation of complexes between the target and aptamer RNAs was evaluated using EMSAs.

In addition, one RNA contains a target site and the other contains a pool consisting of 30 random nucleotides for selection. The RNA with the pool was derived from the P3 stem of Type B RNA and contains the 11-nt receptor and a 30-nt random sequence inserted into the middle of the stem, which also has its tail region for reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, left). The RNA molecule with the target site (referred to as loop B-GAAA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, right) was derived from loop B-containing WT-34 RNA (consisting of 34 nt), which is from the stem-loop IV domain of the enterovirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Loop B is an internal loop consisting of six nucleotides from IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The original apical GUGA tetraloop was replaced with a GAAA tetraloop, which enables it to bind to the 11-nt receptor in the pool RNA. In a 3D model based on the NMR structure, the pool was situated in close proximity to loop B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, right). Finally, the 5&#x02032;-end of the target RNA was biotinylated to separate the aptamers using streptavidine beads. Thus in the model structure, the target site (loop B) and the pool get closer to each other when the RNAs were bound via the loop&#x02013;receptor interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). In other words, sequences in the pool that could potentially bind to the target were forced into close proximity with the target site.</p><p>After five rounds of selection, the recovery rate of the RNA population bound to the target RNA increased dramatically (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). EMSAs confirmed the formation of a complex comprised of pool RNA and loop B-GAAA; however, it was found that the selected RNAs could also form a complex with a competitor RNA termed loop B-UUCG RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, right), which possesses an apical UUCG tetraloop that cannot associate with the 11-nt receptor. This means that the RNAs that bind to the target without the GAAA loop-11-nt receptor interaction were also present among the selectants.</p><p>To separate the desired selectants from the rest, six additional rounds of selection were carried out with loop B-UUCG RNA serving as a competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). After 12 rounds of selection, we observed that the pool RNA was able to bind to the target loop B-GAAA in the presence of the competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The selected RNA population was constrained compared with the initial pool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1A</ext-link>), and we confirmed that it preferentially bound to the target RNA, as compared to the competitor RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1B</ext-link>).

They possess the complementary sequences to loop B.

In contrast, the clones after 5th round preferentially interacted with loop B-UUCG while they contained the complementary sequences against loop B (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1D</ext-link>). These confirm that the competitor RNA effectively worked for selecting desired aptamers. We further analyzed clones 2 and 8 that are most abundant among the 41 clones from the 12th round pool (10 and 14 out of 41 clones, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>).</p><p>The M-fold program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/cgi-bin/rna-form1.cgi">http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/cgi-bin/rna-form1.cgi</ext-link>) predicted that in both clones the region spanning C20-G38, which contains the 11-nt receptor, would fold as designed and that 11 nt (G51-U61) would bulge out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, purple box). As anticipated, the bulging loops contained six nucleotides (G55-U60) fully complementary to loop B (A<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;U<sub>11</sub>) in the target RNA. In addition, the long stem structure in the original molecule without the pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) was altered as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, and M-fold predicted formation of two stems at A70-A104 and A68-A103 in clones 2 and 8, respectively.</p><p>The binding affinities of the selected aptamers for loop B-GAAA RNA were determined by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A).

To identify the region involved in the binding, the 3&#x02032; tails of clones 2 and 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, A70-A104 and A68-A103, respectively) were deleted. The resulting aptamers, clones-2s and -8s, showed slightly greater affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 5.7 and 6.9 nM, respectively) than the originals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), indicating that the 3&#x02032; tail is not required for target binding; indeed, the tail apparently exerts a somewhat negative effect on binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The predicted secondary structure of clone 2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, left) was also confirmed in a footprinting assay described later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). For that reason, clone2s, which showed the greatest affinity for the target, was used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>The loop&#x02013;receptor interaction between clone 2s and loop B-GAAA</title><p>To confirm that the pre-organized GAAA loop-11-nt receptor interaction is maintained within the clone 2s/loop B-GAAA complex, we next carried out a motif swapping experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). We prepared a modified clone 2s (2s-B7.8), in which the 11-nt receptor was replaced with a B7.8 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), and a modified loop B-GAAA (B-GUAA), in which the GAAA loop was replaced with a GUAA loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, clone 2s-B7.8 preferentially interacted with loop B-GUAA: whereas &#x0223c;34% of loop B-GUAA formed a complex with clone 2S-B7.8 (lane 13), no complex was observed between clone 2s-B7.8 and loop B-GAAA under the same conditions (lane 6), although the excess amount of clone 2s-B7.8 interacted with both loop B-GAAA (53%, lane 7) and loop-GUAA (63%, lane 14). Conversely, clone 2s preferentially interacted with loop B-GAAA (lanes 2&#x02013;4), as compared to loop B-GUAA (lanes 9&#x02013;11). That the GAAA-11-nt receptor interaction could be replaced by the GUAA-B7.8 interaction confirms that the pre-organized tetraloop-receptor interaction was maintained between loop B-GAAA and clone 2s. The fact that the clone 2s-B7.8 complex was less stable than the original complex (lanes 12&#x02013;14 versus lanes 2&#x02013;4) is consistent with the reported finding that the GAAA-11-nt receptor interaction is more stable than GUAA-B7.8 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).<fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Motif swapping experiments.

The three clone 2s derivatives (mut4, mut5 and mut9) weakly interacted with loop B-GAAA (lanes 9, 10 and 14), which is indicated by the slight shift of the band relative to the free loop B-GAAA band (see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>).

Clone 2s-8, in which four base pairs at the bottom of clone 2s were replaced with those from clone 8s, showed a strong affinity for loop B RNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 1.8 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D, lane 5) that was comparable to the affinity of clone 2s for loop B RNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 5.7 nM). We presume that the G51-U61 loop region (referred to as Loop-G) of clone 2s is a key determinant of the affinity because the region is conserved in both clones 2 and 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). The Loop-G region also contains the G55-U60 sequence, which is complementary to the target loop B (U<sub>11</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>6</sub>). In fact, deletion of the Loop-G from clone 2s (&#x00394;Loop-G) abolished complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and D, lane 4). To determine which residues in Loop-G interact with loop B-GAAA, we prepared a set of clone 2s derivatives in which Loop-G was modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B; mut1-6). Formation of a complex between Loop-G and loop B-GAAA was abolished by deletion of G55-U60 (mut2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D, lane 7), as well as by deletion of the U52&#x02013;U54 region (mut3; lane 8) or G51/U61 region (mut1, lane 6). Interestingly, mut6, in which U52&#x02013;U54 were replaced with three adenine residues, was able to associate with loop B-GAAA, although the affinity was much weaker than that of the original clone 2s-complex (lane 11; <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = &#x0223c;250 nM, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). The deletion or insertion of a single U at this position (mut4 or mut5, respectively) had more significant effect on target binding (lanes 9 and 10, respectively, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>) compared with mut6, so that the estimated <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of these clones (&#x0223c;500 nM) was higher than that of mut6. The finding that the U52UU54/AAA substitution (mut6) had a more modest effect on binding than U52&#x02013;U54 deletion suggests that this region is indirectly involved in binding, but facilitates the proper folding of the aptamer for binding to the target.</p><p>We next tested whether the linker region connecting the 11-nt receptor with the internal Loop-G plays a role for target recognition by examining the binding of clone 2s derivatives carrying a mutation in the linker region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and C). Because M-fold predicted that the linker region is comprised of a stem with a UCA/GU internal loop (U15&#x02013;A17, G41&#x02013;U42) and a single bulging uridine (U48), we first prepared two internal loop mutants, in which this 3 &#x000d7; 2 internal loop was replaced with a UCA/UGA stem to make this region more rigid (mut7), or UUU/UU loop to make it more flexible (mut9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Both mutations reduced the stability of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D): The mut9 bound to loop B-GAAA with less affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = &#x0223c;500 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D, lane 14, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>), while no binding was observed between loop B-GAAA and mut7 (lane 12). The deletion of U48 (mut8) also significantly inhibited binding to loop B-GAAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D, lane 13). This implies that the linker region contributes to supplement the target recognition. The internal loop and bulging nucleotides in the linker region might play a role in regulating the structural relationship between Loop-G and the 11-nt receptor. We therefore conclude that our present selection optimized the local structures between the binding modules for efficient binding of the two RNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>The interaction between Loop-G and loop B</title><p>We next tested whether Loop-G and loop B interact each other via Watson&#x02013;Crick base-pairings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A).

Taken together, these results indicate that the two RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions, 11-nt receptor-GAAA and Loop-G&#x02013;loop B, are both indispensable for the tight binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Independent folding of the interactive motifs and the linker region</title><p>We prepared two sets of the mutants to see whether the two RNA&#x02013;RNA interactive motifs (GAAA loop-11nt receptor and the Loop-G&#x02013;loop B interaction) and also the selected linker region could be regarded as physically separable units. 11-nt receptor and GAAA loop were replaced with #05 receptor motif and C loop (clone2s-#05 and loop B&#x02013;C loop), respectively, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A): The #05 motif-C loop interaction is equivalent to that between GAAA loop and 11-nt receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).

The method utilizes our molecular modeling of two RNAs using a well-established RNA&#x02013;RNA loop&#x02013;receptor interaction. The selection provided RNA that tightly and selectively bound to the two sites in the target RNA.</p><p>Most aptamer RNAs obtained through <italic>in vitro</italic> selection reportedly bind to their target RNAs via complementary sequences in apical or internal loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14">10&#x02013;14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). This class of RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions, which have come to be called &#x02018;kissing&#x02019; interactions, are one of the most thoroughly studied and have been seen in numerous naturally occurring functional RNAs (e.g. TAR in the HIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Aptamers that bind to their targets through kissing interactions are convenient selectants with which to practice our selection strategy. Using a selected Watson&#x02013;Crick-type kissing interaction together with a pre-organized loop&#x02013;receptor interaction, we are able to tell whether a selected RNA designed to bind to two separate binding sites is actually constructed as designed.</p><p>By employing the strategy described, we obtained a sequence that bound to loop B (6-nt internal loop) in the presence of a pre-organized GAAA tetraloop&#x02013;11-nt receptor interaction. The selected binding module (Loop-G) is an internal loop (G51&#x02013;U61) containing six nucleotides (G55G56G57G58A59U60) that are fully complementary to loop B (A<sub>6</sub>U<sub>7</sub>C<sub>8</sub>C<sub>9</sub>C<sub>10</sub>U<sub>11</sub>). The binding of Loop-G to loop B was much weaker than that of other reported kissing interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In fact, the affinity of Loop-G for loop B (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0003e; 1 &#x003bc;M) was weaker than the affinity of a 6-mer antisense oligo RNA (5&#x02032;-GGGGAU-3&#x02032;) for loop B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F, lane 3 versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 4). This is because the selection is designed to isolate the aptamers binding to the target RNA via two sites. Coexistence of GAAA loop/11-nt receptor interaction was necessary to form a stable (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = &#x0223c;6 nM) complex. Consequently clone 2s aptamer formed a stable complex with the target molecule via two cooperative interactions. The sequence or structure of Loop-G and/or loop B is likely one factor underlying their weak binding affinity. Within Loop-G, U52&#x02013;U54, which is not complementary to loop B, is also crucial for stabilizing the complex. These may contribute to the stabilization via non-Watson&#x02013;Crick base-pairings, or indirectly optimize the complex formation. Similar effects of extra residues have been frequently observed in other kissing interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). We suggest that the sequence involved in the base-pairings (G55&#x02013;U60) and their structure plays a key role in stabilizing the complex, as compensatory mutations within the complementary sequences substantially reduced stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E, <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = &#x0223c;500 nM). In fact, it has been reported that a single nucleotide substitution in loop B dramatically alters its structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>)&#x02014;i.e. a C&#x02192;U substitution at position 10 of WT-34 (corresponding to loop B-C<sub>8</sub>/U RNA) altered the overall shape of the RNA and the flexibility of bulging region.</p><p>The selected clones after 5th round of the selection exhibited complementary sequences to loop B: six clones from these selectants possessed the strong affinity to both loop B-GAAA and loop B-UUCG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). For the rounds performed after the 5th, we employed a competitor RNA (loop B-UUCG) to make sure that the aptamers bind to the target via two coordinated interactions. Clone 2s and the others obtained after 11th round specifically exhibited the affinity to the target RNA but not to the competitor RNA (loop B-UUCG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). This suggests that the incorporation of aptamers that tightly bind to the loop B by itself might have been refused in the selections after the 5th round due to the steric constraint and/or the conditions we employed.</p></sec><sec><title>Linker region optimized for cooperative binding</title><p>To select RNA modular units that are either physically separable binding motifs or catalytic modules, modified <italic>in vitro</italic> selection through the use of natural or artificially designed RNA structures with a small pool of randomized nucleotides have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30 B31">28&#x02013;31</xref>). In one case, Jaeger and his colleagues selected a receptor motif against a GNRA tetraloop by using tectoRNA as a scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The 11-nt receptor for the GNRA loop in the tectoRNA was replaced with 17 random nucleotides for the selection, and the selected receptors showed modularity and function in the context of tectoRNA as well as in the originally designed structure. As a result of the molecular design, the selection of a module that fit into the designed scaffold could be obtained with minor neutral mutations in the linker region connecting the GAAA tetraloop and the selected receptor module.</p><p>Linker regions in modular aptamers can be modified to achieve increased affinity or additional functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34">32&#x02013;34</xref>). In the case of tectoRNA, two tetraloop&#x02013;receptor interactions were connected on the basis of structural information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The length, helical twist and flexibility of the linker region connecting two interactive motifs can have a critical effect on the stability of a complex. In fact, linker regions are tunable through modular engineering, and optimizing the linkage between the two interactions can increase the stability of a complex by more than five orders of magnitude, as compared to corresponding disordered linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). But although the linker region has a crucial effect on cooperative binding, it is difficult to design an optimized linker region <italic>de novo</italic>. If something goes wrong, a designed linker could cause misfolding of the whole aptamer, for example. To avoid such misfolding, in some instances polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been used to connect two aptamers, which weakly but positively affected the affinity between two conjugated aptamers and their substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, our method provides a clue to obtain a linker region optimized for cooperative binding of the two binding modules, since the sequence of the linker region connecting the target molecule's two binding sites was also selected for optimal binding of the two RNA modules. In clone 2s, the linker region had a crucial effect on the binding of Loop-G and loop B.</p></sec><sec><title>Further development of aptamers</title><p>In the present study, clone 2s bound to loop B-GAAA RNA with high affinity and specificity, indicating that a newly selected internal loop and/or linker region could be used as a new scaffold for another set of selections. For example, the selection will provide new binding modules against a target motif in the RNA possessing loop B (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3A and 3B</ext-link>).</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, the naturally occurring loop B motif located in the stem-loop IV domain of the enterovirus IRES is recognized by the host cell protein PCBP2 [poly(rC)-binding protein]. Structural and biochemical studies have shown that the interaction between WT-34 RNA (34 nt containing loop B) and PCBP2 is essential for efficient translation of the viral mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Molecules like clone 2s, which simultaneously recognizes two RNA modules (loop B and GAAA loop) within WT-34-like RNAs could be a more effective inhibitor against various viruses (e.g. <italic>Poliovirus</italic> type 1) than a simple kissing aptamer against loop B. It is also possible to redesign such molecules to select a third binding module against a new target site. Aptamers with three binding sites should bind with even more selectively and greater affinity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3C</ext-link>).</p><p>Our selection provides weak but specific interactive motifs with optimized linker regions for cooperative binding of two RNAs. Numerous combinations of two weak interactions are possible so that various modular RNAs with two binding sites can be prepared by performing the selection. The selected RNAs that specifically and tightly bind to the target RNA are versatile as new parts for designing and building useful RNA architectures. For example, the resulting RNA architecture may be employed as a riboswitch under the control of the aptamer for regulating translation or other biological activities in cell.</p><p>It has been reported that one tertiary RNA&#x02013;RNA interaction distant from the active site can enhance the activity of the hammerhead ribozyme by 1000-fold compared with the corresponding minimal ribozyme lacking the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). This is one example that a naturally occurring functional RNA employs a set of interactive motifs for building global RNA architectures. Thus it will be of interest to see whether certain naturally occurring RNA&#x02013;RNA interactive motifs are related to the selected ones by our method. Identification of such motifs would provide a clue for understanding the evolution of naturally occurring RNA&#x02013;RNA interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1012/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The work is supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research of Priority Areas and ICORP, JST (H.S., T.I.).
