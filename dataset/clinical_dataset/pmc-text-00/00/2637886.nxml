Detection of restriction enzyme cleavage sites in DNA sequences was an early use of this pattern matching process. Later, as the protein databases grew, the PROSITE motif database was developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These protein motifs are written as regular expressions that capture the variability within a consensus sequence from a short, highly conserved region in a multiple alignment. As the volume and diversity of genomic information grows, it is necessary to modify PROSITE patterns to allow them to match more diverse homologs. Searching through genomic sequences for conserved nucleotide patterns such as transcription factor binding sites is another use for this type of analysis. Large-scale sequencing has lead to some automated bioinformatics analyses, but pattern searching is such a common "hands on" interactive procedure that we have developed an easy-to-use tool, Sequence Searcher (SeqS), that supports searching for user-specified patterns in multiple protein and nucleotide sequences. SeqS has been integrated into several of the Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center tools and can therefore read sequences directly out of the VOCs database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], but it also function as a stand-alone program with the ability to manage sequences much larger than viral genomes.</p><sec><title>Algorithms</title><p>We implemented a brute-force fuzzy search algorithm and made use of the Jakarta ORO libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] for Perl-like regular expressions. To speed up the searches and reduce memory requirements, an algorithm to reverse both fuzzy patterns and regular expressions was developed. In a search on DNA, SeqS first searches the top strand (the sequence itself), and then the bottom strand. However, rather than creating a duplicate (the bottom strand) of the nucleotide sequence, which is expensive in terms of memory, SeqS reverses and complements the query and searches the top strand again.</p></sec><sec><title>Implementation</title><p>In the development of SeqS, our goal was to produce an intuitive interface with easily understood output. The stand-alone interface of SeqS is simple and consists of two panels, accessed by the <italic>input </italic>and <italic>results </italic>tabs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In the <italic>input </italic>panel, users can import sequences to the workspace, set the search parameters and initiate the search. SeqS accepts one or many sequences (FASTA format) as input, either <italic>imported </italic>from a text file or directly pasted into a text box (<italic>add manually)</italic>. Sequence names are shown in the <italic>List of target sequences </italic>box and the program uses selected sequences, or all sequences if none are selected. Sequence Searcher recognises ambiguity codes for amino acids and nucleotides as described by IUPAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and tries to determine if a sequence contains nucleic acid or amino acids. SeqS supports two search types: <italic>regular expression </italic>and <italic>fuzzy</italic>. Although a <italic>regular expression </italic>may describe variation (AAA [CG], AAA followed by C or G), these searches are always exact and in this example only match patterns specified by the user (AAAC or AAAG). Supported <italic>regular expression </italic>patterns are <italic>characters </italic>(such as A and C), <italic>character sets </italic>(such as [AG]), <italic>quantifiers </italic>(such as +, ?, *, {<italic>n</italic>, <italic>m</italic>}) and <italic>back references </italic>(such as (NNNN)\1). The pattern AAA [^C] [GT].{1,10}(AT)\1 translates to AAA, anything but C, then G or T, anything 1&#x02013;10 times, AT repeated twice. A useful feature of regular expressions is the ability to allow variable space between 2 patterns. In contrast, a <italic>fuzzy </italic>search allows a specified number of mismatches within the pattern; e.g. ATGATAGT with 3 mismatches. However, the <italic>fuzzy </italic>search also supports a basic syntax similar to regular expressions to allow even more flexible pattern recognition; it is possible to match one of some characters by listing them within square brackets ([AG] matches either A or G) and it is also possible to exclude characters by placing them within braces ({AG} matches neither A nor G). SeqS allows the number of mismatches to be 0&#x02013;40% of the pattern length; this prevents the search from taking too long and returning too many imprecise matches.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>SeqS user interface</bold>. Left side: Input panel, 10 poxvirus genomes searched with a fuzzy pattern; right side: Results panel, showing positions of mismatches within matched pattern.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1756-0500-2-14-1"/></fig><p>Upon completion of a search, the <italic>results </italic>panel is presented, showing the data in tabular format (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). It is possible to sort the table by any data column using the column header (sequence, match, match start, match stop, confidence, strand) as well as filter the results set by sequence and by strand using drop-down menus. The search parameters are also reported. To facilitate interpretation of <italic>fuzzy </italic>search results, an additional graphical representation of the match is included in the form of a multi-coloured line that is divided into a series of segments numbering equal to the length of the pattern match. A segment is coloured green if a character match is exact, orange if it matches an ambiguity character and red in the case of a mismatch. The user can choose to save the results (all or selected rows) to a tab-delimited text file that is easily imported into a spreadsheet for further analysis.</p><p>SeqS is limited by the amount of memory dedicated to the Java Virtual Machine and may run out of memory during import of sequences or performing a search. However, for most practical work with viral and bacterial genomes, these limits are of no consequence. For example, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows a series of searches performed with a set of sequences totalling 170 Mb that each took 4 s or less (iMac with 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo and 4 GB RAM). SeqS imports the test sequences at approximately 1 Mb/s.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Examples of SeqS searches on DNA sequences totalling 170 MB.
