We have performed a comprehensive analysis of the proteins containing homopolymeric histidine tracts in the human genome and identified 86 human proteins that contain stretches of five or more histidines. Most of them are endowed with DNA- and RNA-related functions, and, in addition, there is an overrepresentation of proteins expressed in the brain and/or nervous system development. An analysis of their subcellular localization shows that 15 of the 22 nuclear proteins identified accumulate in the nuclear subcompartment known as nuclear speckles. This localization is lost when the histidine repeat is deleted, and significantly, closely related paralogous proteins without histidine repeats also fail to localize to nuclear speckles. Hence, the histidine tract appears to be directly involved in targeting proteins to this compartment. The removal of DNA-binding domains or treatment with RNA polymerase II inhibitors induces the re-localization of several polyhistidine-containing proteins from the nucleoplasm to nuclear speckles. These findings highlight the dynamic relationship between sites of transcription and nuclear speckles. Therefore, we define the histidine repeats as a novel targeting signal for nuclear speckles, and we suggest that these repeats are a way of generating evolutionary diversification in gene duplicates. These data contribute to our better understanding of the physiological role of single amino acid repeats in proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Single amino acid repeats are common in eukaryotic proteins. Some of them are associated with developmental and neurodegenerative disorders in humans, suggesting that they play important functions. However, the role of many of these repeats is unknown. Here, we have studied histidine repeats from a bioinformatics as well as a functional point of view. We found that only 86 proteins in the human genome contain stretches of five or more histidines, and that most of these proteins have functions related with RNA synthesis. When studying where these proteins localize in the cell, we found that a significant proportion accumulate in a subnuclear organelle known as nuclear speckles, via the histidine repeat. This is a structure where proteins related to the synthesis and processing of RNA accumulate. In some cases, the localization is transient and depends on the transcriptional requirements of the cell. Our findings are important because they identify a common cellular function for stretches of histidine residues, and they support the notion that histidine repeats contribute to generate evolutionary diversification. Finally, and considering that some of the proteins with histidine stretches are key elements in essential developmental processes, variation in these repeats would be expected to contribute to human disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Single amino acid repeats (SARs), also known as homopolymeric tracts, are very common in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Huntley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and between 18&#x02013;20&#x00025; of proteins in the human genome contain such repetitive sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Karlin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Their repetitive nature facilitates DNA replication slippage, and the expansion or contraction of the repeats (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Pearson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>).

For example, polyglutamine expansions have been associated with Huntington's disease and certain types of spinocerebellar ataxia (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Gatchel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>). In addition, alanine repeats are related to several developmental disorders (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Albrecht1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>), and aspartate hyperexpansions with two types of dysplasia and osteoarthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Delot1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Kizawa1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Some of the mechanisms thought to underlie the pathogenic effects of expanded tracts involve the deregulation of transcriptional activity and the formation of toxic protein aggregates (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Gatchel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Menon1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>). Nevertheless, the functions of many homopeptidic segments found in proteins have not yet been elucidated.</p><p>Among homopolymeric tracts, histidine (His) repeats are relatively rare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Faux1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, their frequency increases from about 1.4&#x00025; to 4.3&#x00025; when we consider repeats of at least 8 instead of 5 residues, indicating that they are generally longer than other types of SARs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Alba1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The physicochemical properties of His make it a versatile amino acid that can fulfill different roles, influencing protein conformation and enzymatic activity. For instance, His-repeats are found in Zn-finger domains that are implicated in interactions between nucleic acids and proteins (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Gamsjaeger1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>), and a His-stretch has been described as a protein interacting surface of the transcriptional regulator cyclin T1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Hoque1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Taube1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, there is still no clear function associated to His homopeptides. We previously described the His-repeat in the DYRK1A protein kinase as both necessary and sufficient to target this protein to nuclear speckles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Alvarez1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. A protein segment containing a His-tract is also involved in the accumulation of cyclin T1 in these nuclear structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Alvarez1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Herrmann1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. These results provided the first evidence that His-repeats may act as nuclear speckle-targeting signals, although the extent to which this was true in other proteins remained to be determined.</p><p>Nuclear speckles (also known as the splicing factor compartment -SFC- or as interchromatin granule clusters -IGCs-) are subnuclear structures defined as compartments in which components of the RNA splicing machinery are stored and assembled (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Lamond1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>). They mainly contain splicing factors (snRNPs and serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins), as well as transcription factors, 3&#x02032;-RNA processing factors, translation factors, ribosomal proteins, a subpopulation of the RNA polymerase II and some kinases and phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Mintz1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Saitoh1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Like other nuclear bodies, nuclear speckles are highly dynamic structures that change in number, shape and size depending on the transcriptional state and the phase of the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Lamond1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here, we have performed an in-depth analysis of polyHis-containing proteins in the human genome. A significant fraction of the proteins identified are transcription factors and developmental proteins with a nuclear phase. The subcellular localization of several of these proteins shows that most of them accumulate in nuclear speckles through their His-repeat. The presence of DNA-binding or protein-protein interaction domains, and the transcriptional state of the cell, are factors that affect the retention of transcription factors with His-repeats in nuclear speckles, illustrating the dynamic behavior of these proteins. Together, these results define the His-repeat as a novel and general targeting signal for nuclear speckles.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Repeat of 6 His Residues Is Sufficient to Direct a Heterologous Protein to the Nuclear Speckles</title><p>For a typical protein of 400 amino acids and of average composition, a run of any individual amino acid is significant if there are 5 or more consecutive residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Karlin3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Following this premise, we established a threshold of 5 His residues to determine the minimum number of His necessary for a His-containing protein to accumulate in nuclear speckles. We generated plasmids to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins with 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 His, and we analyzed the subcellular localization of these fusion proteins by direct fluorescence in transfected HeLa cells.

The lower-limit of 5 His residues was set to cover all possible functionally significant repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Karlin3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Our search identified 86 Ensembl genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000397.s010">Table S1</xref>). As some of the proteins encoded by these genes contained more than one repeat, there was a total of 99 repeats with 5 residues or more. The average size of the His-repeats was 7.5, with the longest repeat containing 15 residues (LOC730417). The majority of the repeats were well conserved in the corresponding mouse orthologous proteins; 54&#x00025; showed exactly the same length and 30&#x00025; differed in only one or two repeat units. When more than one His-repeat was present in a protein, they were generally very close to each other such that they could be considered as &#x0201c;extended&#x0201d; His-repeat tracts (for instance, H<sub>4</sub>GNSSH<sub>13</sub> in DYRK1A). Thus, we defined &#x0201c;extended&#x0201d; tracts as regions that contained at least one pure His-repeat of 5 residues or more, that had His residues at the start and/or end of the tract, and that contained other &#x0201c;interrupting&#x0201d; residues (often P, Q, G, S, A) which covered &#x0003c;50&#x00025; of the tract. Such extended tracts were present in half of the proteins containing pure His-repeats (43 out of 86). Significantly, none of the His-repeats were situated within characterized protein domains and unlike other repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Alba1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, we did not find them preferentially located at the amino-, carboxy-, or central part of the proteins.</p><p>We compared the length distribution of His-repeats in coding sequences to that of equivalent sequences in non-coding regions, the latter defined as sequences containing at least five tandem CAY (CAC or CAT: His encoding triplets). Accordingly, we identified 7815 such repeats in non-coding genomic regions. Interestingly, although much longer repeats existed in the non-coding regions (the longest was 154 trinucleotides), their average size (7.24) was smaller than in coding regions. Indeed, the distribution of the repeat size was significantly different between coding and non-coding sequences (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.003, non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).

As the length distribution of non-coding repeats is likely to reflect neutral mutational processes, this difference points to selective retention of relatively long His-repeats in protein sequences.</p><fig id="pgen-1000397-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000397.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Distribution of CAC/CAT repeat sizes in coding (A) and non-coding (B) regions.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000397.g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>His-Repeats Are Overrepresented in Nuclear Proteins</title><p>The population of proteins containing other types of amino acid repeats, such as polyglutamine, polyalanine, polyglycine, polyserine and polyproline, is enriched in transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Alba1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

The subcellular distribution of the fusion proteins was analyzed by direct fluorescence in transient transfected cells and nuclear speckles were identified by anti-SC35 staining. As previously described for cyclin T1 and DYRK1A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Alvarez1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, other polyHis-containing proteins also showed punctate nuclear staining that co-localized with SC35, such as the transcription factors POU4F2 or YY1, or the protein kinase NLK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Fluorescence images revealed differences in the staining patterns for the His-repeats-containing proteins, with some of them showing more nucleoplasmic staining than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; see other examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g005">Figures 5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g006"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g007"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g008">8</xref>). The His-repeat seemed to be necessary for this subnuclear localization since deletion of the polyHis segment alone from POU4F2 or DYRK1A (the extended His-repeat) completely abrogated the accumulation of these proteins in SC35-labelled nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

Similar results were obtained when the His-repeat was deleted in NLK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000397.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These data indicate that the deletion has not induced a general alteration of protein structure, and further suggest that the His-tract conveys a novel behavior to the host protein without affecting its basic activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>His-Repeats and Gene Duplication</title><p>Interestingly, a significant fraction (64&#x00025;) of the genes encoding proteins with His-repeats had closely-related paralogues in the human genome. According to Ensembl annotations, 74&#x00025; of them had been presumably formed by gene duplication at the dawn of vertebrate evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000397.s011">Table S2</xref>). However, in most cases none of the paralogues contained a similar His-repeat in their primary sequence. This indicates that the repeat had only later appeared in one of the duplicate copies, probably by duplication slippage. To approximately date their appearance, we inspected all the orthologous and paralogous vertebrate proteins in Ensembl for the presence of similar His-repeats. In 11 out of 39 cases, the repeat was found in all vertebrate orthologues but in none of the paralogues, indicating that they arose soon after the duplication event. However, the dominant class was repeats formed at the base of the placental mammals (14 cases). Notably, a large number of alanine and glycine repeats are also proposed to be specific to mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Lavoie1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Sumiyama1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

Finally, the His-repeats in the <italic>BMP2K</italic> and <italic>PBXIP1</italic> genes were restricted to primates, suggesting they arose relatively recently.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Paralogous Proteins without His-Repeats Fail to Localize in Nuclear Speckles</title><p>Given the significant number of polyHis-containing proteins with paralogous proteins without His-repeats, we reasoned that if the His-repeat were responsible for their accumulation in speckles then the paralogous copy without the repeat should not be found in this subnuclear compartment. To confirm this hypothesis, we examined the FAM76A and FAM76B pair of paralogues. A sequence alignment of these two proteins highlighted their high degree of conservation, except in the region containing the His-repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). As hypothesized, the paralogue without the His-tract, FAM76A, presented a diffuse nucleoplasmic staining, while the protein with the polyHis segment, FAM76B, accumulated in nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Similar results were obtained for other pairs of paralogous proteins such as DYRK1A/DYRK1B or POU4F2/POU4F3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000397.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Thus, these findings further indicate that the His-repeats in these proteins are necessary for their localization to nuclear speckles.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>The Subcellular Localization of PolyHis-Containing Proteins Depends on other Domains Present in the Proteins</title><p>The initial analysis of the nuclear localization of polyHis-containing candidates revealed that some proteins did not apparently localize to nuclear speckles. These proteins contained other protein domains such as DNA binding domains or protein-protein interacting regions. For instance, the transcription factors MEOX2 and OTX1 harbor a homeobox DNA-binding domain in their C- and N-terminal regions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g006">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000397.s005">Figure S5</xref>). In the case of the Sumo E3 ligase CBX4, its C-terminal region includes domains that interact with the polycomb protein CtBP2 and the transcriptional repressor RING1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). These domains mediate the localization of CBX4 to subnuclear foci, that are compatible with polycomb bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Kagey1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that the accumulation of proteins to nuclear speckles may be influenced by other interactions. To confirm this hypothesis, we deleted the DNA binding domain in MEOX2 and assessed its nuclear distribution. Accordingly, while the wild type protein presented the dispersed distribution typical of most transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), compatible with active transcription sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Wei1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, the mutant protein in which the homeobox was eliminated (MEOX2&#x00394;HB) fully co-localized with SC35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the OTX1 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000397.s005">Figure S5</xref>). In the case of CBX4, we assessed whether deleting the C-terminal fragment spanning the CtBP2 and RING1-interacting domains (CBX4&#x00394;PB) similarly affected its distribution. While the wild type CBX4 protein was present in nuclear foci that were not positive for SC35, the mutant CBX4&#x00394;PB co-localized with SC35 in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). These results confirmed that the accumulation of some of the polyHis-containing proteins in nuclear speckles was influenced by their binding to other nuclear components, such as DNA or diverse subnuclear structures. Moreover, they suggest that competition between distinct protein regions dictates the steady state subnuclear localization of the protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Transit through Nuclear Speckles Is a Dynamic Property of PolyHis-Containing Proteins</title><p>In mammalian cells, the structure and function of nuclear speckles is sensitive to the transcriptional state of the cell (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Lamond1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>). When cells are treated with RNA polymerase II transcription inhibitors, there is a decrease in the splicing activity and a redistribution of the components of speckles, which are recruited to larger and rounder nuclear speckles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Zeng1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Most of the His-containing proteins were transcription factors and since our results showed that DNA binding activity influenced their accumulation in speckles, we wondered whether their failure to localize to this subnuclear compartment might be reverted by inhibiting RNA polymerase II activity. Two proteins, FOXG1B and HOXA1, that did not produce speckled staining at the steady state, co-localized with SC35 in fewer but larger speckles after &#x003b1;-amanitin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000397-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). Interestingly, the diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution of several other transcription factors became punctate in cells treated with &#x003b1;-amanitin, and it overlapped with SC35 staining (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000397-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000397.s006">Figure S6A</xref>).

For HOXA1, we noticed that the staining not only overlapped with SC35 foci but it also adopted a &#x0201c;capped structure&#x0201d;, as described for the recently reported S1-1 nuclear domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Inoue1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since nuclear speckles and S1-1 domains have been suggested to be functionally connected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Inoue1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that HOXA1 could

We have performed an exhaustive analysis of the proteins containing His-tracts in the human genome, confirming that His-repeats are uncommon within proteomes. Moreover, they tend to be well conserved between human and mouse, with about 85&#x00025; of them showing at most one repeat unit size difference. The low rates of heterozygosity observed in (CAC)n microsatellites in coding regions also suggest that the evolution of these His-repeat has been limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Sertedaki1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Although His-tracts of moderate length are likely to have been positively selected in human proteins, as shown by the comparison to CAC/CAT repeats in non-coding regions, there may be a limit to the repeat size. In fact, we noted the absence of pure tracts with more than 15 His-residues, whereas much longer tracts may exist for other SARs. For example, alanine repeats of 25 residues are present in several developmental proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Albrecht1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and non-pathogenic glutamine tracts may reach about 60 repeat units <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Gatchel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Besides, half of the proteins with His-repeats contained extended tracts interrupted by other amino acids. Interestingly, the most common interrupting amino acids were those that typically form homopeptidic stretches in transcription factors, such as proline, glutamine or glycine. Enrichment of this type of amino acids has also been observed in polyglutamine containing proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Hancock1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Stretching this idea further, repeats may often grow within repeats, as illustrated by the appearance of SSS, PPP or GGG repeats within extended His-repeats (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000397-t001">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, the disrupting residues may act as brakes for the expansion of the pure repeats, and restrict the size of the His-repeat, which in turn might reduce the likelihood of protein aggregation and associated pathogenic effects.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>The His-Repeat Is a Novel Nuclear Speckle-Localization Signal</title><p>The mammalian nucleus is a highly complex organelle that is both physically and functionally compartmentalized (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Lamond1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Handwerger1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>). The subnuclear structures are associated with specific biological activities related to the synthesis, processing and modification of RNA, and they can be distinguished by morphological criteria and the presence of specific protein markers. One such compartment is that of the nuclear speckles. The mechanisms responsible for the formation and regulation of these structures are not yet known and as for many other nuclear bodies, it has been proposed that they are highly dynamic self-organizing entities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Misteli1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. A rapid exchange of protein components between subnuclear compartments has been reported, which can be explained by a reaction-diffusion model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Phair1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the kinetics associated to a particular protein can be affected by its binding to other molecules, either proteins or nucleic acids, which in turn can aid its recruitment to a specific compartment. Accordingly, a few protein domains have been described that direct proteins to nuclear speckles, such as the arginine/serine-rich (RS)-domain in SR proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Hedley1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref> or the RNA recognition motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Dye1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

Given that the functions of many of the polyHis-containing proteins were related to DNA and RNA metabolism, it was plausible that this role as a subnuclear targeting signal could be more general in other proteins. Indeed, a significant proportion of the polyHis-containing proteins analyzed have the ability to accumulate in nuclear speckles either at the steady-state or upon transcription inhibition. This targeting may respond to the nature of nuclear speckles as sites of storage, recycling and degradation of factors involved in DNA and RNA metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Lamond1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Baldin1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.

Importantly, accumulation in nuclear speckles is dependent on the presence of the His-tract, as confirmed by both deletion analysis in some candidate proteins and by the behavior of paralogous proteins lacking the His-repeat. Apart from the previously mentioned DYRK1A and cyclin T1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Alvarez1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Herrmann1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, only HOXA9 had already been reported to accumulate in nuclear speckles of unknown nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Shen1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Given that our analysis was performed by transient transfection of plasmids expressing the candidate proteins fused to GFP, we tried to rule out non-physiological effects due to overexpression.

We also analyzed the behavior of a stably expressed polyHis-containing protein (DYRK1A) fused to GFP during the cell cycle.

As additional support for the specificity of the subcellular localization, we did not detect an accumulation of the GFP-9xHis chimera in other subnuclear compartments and there was no colocalization with different marker proteins or any specific accumulation in the cytoplasm of the transfected cells, suggesting that the fusion protein is not recruited to a specific cytosolic organelle.</p><p>It seems most likely that the His-repeat acts as a nuclear speckle-targeting signal by serving as an interaction surface for resident molecules in the speckle. The features of His make it a versatile amino acid, strongly represented in enzymatic and binding activities. Histidine's imidazole side-chain allows it to shift from a neutral to positive charge in a pH-dependent fashion, a property that may have an impact on the binding capabilities of a His-stretch. Moreover, the presence of His in a &#x003b2;-strand provides a charge gradient that could mediate protein-protein or protein-DNA via electrostatic interactions. His is also known as an excellent ligand to coordinate metal ions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Gamsjaeger1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, which can also participate in organizing interacting domains. All these mechanisms may contribute to finely regulate the binding properties of His-repeats.

We failed to find a specific code underlying targeting to nuclear speckles, except that a minimum of 6 His residues is required for this effect, which indicates a high degree of flexibility in this functional signal. Considering that His-repeats are widely used as tags for affinity-purification and immunodetection of expressed proteins, we would like to stress the fact that more than 6 His residues may alter the original localization of a tagged protein.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>His-Repeats as a Way of Generating Evolutionary Diversification in Gene Duplicates</title><p>Only 22&#x00025; of SARPs have paralogous proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Siwach1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas a large fraction of the genes encoding proteins with His-repeats have closely-related paralogues.

Therefore, the appearance of a new repeat, or variations in the length and composition of an existing one, may have been an important mechanism for functional diversification. The acquisition of a new His-repeat might have contributed to the reorganization of protein-protein interaction networks and more specifically, to nuclear speckle targeting as a novel cell property associated to the paralogous protein.

The fact that these proteins contain domains that may control their specific localization within the nucleus, such as DNA binding regions or protein-protein interaction domains, led us to think that competition between His-repeats and other protein regions might regulate their intranuclear distribution. Our results show a direct correlation between loss of DNA binding activity and accumulation in nuclear speckles. Similar behavior was recently described for the transcription factor GATA-4, although the subnuclear compartment to which it localized was not identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Philips1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. Although we cannot ignore that the elimination of the DNA binding domains may result in a conformational change that exposes the His-repeat, we favor a loss of retention in the chromosomal compartment as being responsible for the enrichment in nuclear speckles. This assumption is supported by the results with inhibitors of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, since treatment with &#x003b1;-amanitin caused re-localization to nuclear speckles of many of the proteins with a dispersed nuclear distribution under basal conditions. In this regard, we noted that the subgroup of proteins unable to accumulate in nuclear speckles was enriched in proteins with more than one DNA binding domain, a feature that may confer a more immobile character to these proteins. Thus, we propose that the intranuclear localization of some transcription factors with His-repeats is the net result of competition for binding to different recruiting sites within the nucleus, such as DNA, nuclear speckles or other nuclear bodies. Moreover, this dynamic behavior might also explain why among the proteins listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000397-t001">Table 1</xref>, only OTX1 appeared in a proteomic analysis of enriched preparations of interchromatin granule clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Saitoh1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Such a proteomic analysis would not consider proteins present in low amounts and/or proteins that are transiently found in such structures.</p><p>It is widely accepted that RNA processing occurs co-transcriptionally and thus, there is a co-localization of factors related to RNA biogenesis, such as transcription and splicing factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Maniatis1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. When needed, transcription factors are recruited to specific promoters in active transcription sites whereas splicing factors are assembled into the spliceosome. During transcriptionally inactive periods, the splicing factors re-locate to the speckle domains, and some transcription factors might also behave similarly. Transit through the speckles may provide the opportunity for transcription factors to encounter RNA processing factors and/or other transcription factors, and to assemble into complexes acting on the same gene. This re-localization may also involve the targeting of transcription factors no longer able to bind DNA to other compartments for degradation or other processing activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Baldin1">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-vonMikecz1">69</xref>. In addition, compartmentalization of transcription-related proteins within distinct nuclear bodies may be an important mechanism to regulate gene expression. For instance, the inactivation of the transcription factor HAND1 by nucleoli retention has been implicated in trophoblast stem cell proliferation and renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Martindill1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>, and estrogen receptor-enhanced transcription requires interchromosomal interactions at nuclear speckles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Nunez1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of a common sequence to direct a subset of proteins to nuclear speckles, such as the His-repeats, may confer functional advantages. First, it may represent a way to concentrate functionally related proteins, perhaps facilitating their physical interaction. Second, it may reflect a common mechanism to regulate these proteins. Indeed, given that most of the polyHis-containing proteins are involved in developmental processes, His-repeats may be a means of keeping transcription factors away from promoters when they are not required.</p><p>Uncontrolled expansion of SARs is associated with developmental and neurodegenerative human diseases (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Karlin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Gatchel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000397-Albrecht1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>), although no pathological His expansions/deletions have yet been reported.

Cells grown on coverslips were analyzed by direct fluorescence (central panel) and DNA was stained with TO-PRO-3 to distinguish interphase from mitotic nuclei (left panel). Note that GFP-DYRK1A(378&#x02013;616) is expressed in discrete foci compatible with nuclear speckles in interphase nuclei, whereas during mitosis (prophase, upper panel; anaphase, lower panel) diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm is observed as a consequence of nuclear speckle disassembly. This behavior mirrors that of endogenous SC35, whose speckled distribution is lost during prophase.</p><p>(0.96 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000397.s009.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000397.s010"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Results of the bioinformatics screen used to identify human proteins containing at least one His-repeat of 5 or more residues.</p><p>(0.04 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000397.s010.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000397.s011"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Results of the analysis to identify the paralogues of the genes encoding proteins with His-repeats in the human genome.</p><p>(0.04 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000397.s011.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000397.s012"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>Information on IMAGE clones and the oligonucleotides used to generate all the expression vectors.</p><p>(0.06 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000397.s012.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000397.s013"><label>Table S4</label><caption><p>Oligonucleotides used to obtain the plasmids expressing His-tracts fused to GFP.</p><p>(0.05 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000397.s013.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000397.s014"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Supporting Materials and Methods.</p><p>(0.07 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000397.s014.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000397.s015"><label>Video S1</label><caption><p><italic>In vivo</italic> imaging of GFP-HOXA1.
