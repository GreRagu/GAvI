Despite the importance of light as a regulator of malaria transmission, our knowledge on the molecular interactions between environmental cues, the circadian oscillators and the host seeking and feeding systems of the <italic>Anopheles </italic>mosquitoes is limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the present study, we show that the blood feeding behavior of mosquitoes is under circadian control and can be modulated by light pulses, both in a clock dependent and in an independent manner. Short light pulses (~2&#x02013;5 min) in the dark phase can inhibit the blood-feeding propensity of mosquitoes momentarily in a clock independent manner, while longer durations of light stimulation (~1&#x02013;2 h) can induce a phase advance in blood-feeding propensity in a clock dependent manner. The temporary feeding inhibition after short light pulses may reflect a masking effect of light, an unknown mechanism which is known to superimpose on the true circadian regulation. Nonetheless, the shorter light pulses resulted in the differential regulation of a variety of genes including those implicated in the circadian control, suggesting that light induced masking effects also involve clock components. Light pulses (both short and long) also regulated genes implicated in feeding as well as different physiological processes like metabolism, transport, immunity and protease digestions. RNAi-mediated gene silencing assays of the light pulse regulated circadian factors <italic>timeless</italic>, <italic>cryptochrome </italic>and three <italic>takeout </italic>homologues significantly up-regulated the mosquito's blood-feeding propensity. In contrast, gene silencing of light pulse regulated olfactory factors down-regulated the mosquito's propensity to feed on blood.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study show that the mosquito's feeding behavior is under circadian control.

Genetic and molecular analyses in a range of evolutionary distant organisms, including the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, have revealed a striking degree of conservation of these oscillators and their underlying molecular mechanisms, many of which involve transcriptional feedback loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Timeless (tim) is one of the crucial factors that connects the endogenous clock with the external environment such as light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. When light pulses are applied early in the subjective night (soon after the lights have gone off) a phase delay is produced. Conversely, when light pulses are applied just before lights would have come on, a phase advance is produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Food is another potent clock-entraining cue, and the <italic>D. melanogaster takeout </italic>(<italic>to</italic>) gene has been shown to act as a molecular link between the circadian rhythm and feeding behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Despite the essential role of circadian clocks in the regulation of vector behaviors that enable disease transmission, little is known about the molecular control of the host-seeking and feeding behavior of mosquitoes. It has been shown that the <italic>A. gambiae </italic>flight activity peaks during the night time and during the twilight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Light has also been shown to inhibit <italic>A. gambiae </italic>flight activity and to re-set the rhythm by delaying it; however if the light phase begins early, it has a phase-advancing effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The host-seeking and feeding behaviors of many hematophagous insects exhibit rhythmic biting activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; reaching peak levels in mid-night and are largely controlled by several circadian and chemosensory systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] involving a variety of odorant binding proteins (obp) and odorant receptors (or) that are linked to downstream signaling cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>antennae, the chemosensory components have been shown to be regulated by peripheral circadian oscillators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Here we have initiated a detailed dissection of the delicate interactions that occur between the mosquito's light-sensing system, the circadian oscillators and the host seeking and feeding systems. Several studies have reported the influence of light on the flight activity of mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], while there is no comprehensive information available on the regulation of the mosquito's blood-feeding behavior by light, at least at the molecular level. We show that light pulses can induce changes in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>gambiae </italic>blood-feeding behavior and in the mosquito's global transcriptome, including transcripts that are regulated by blood feeding. We have functionally characterized selected genes that respond to the light stimulus by RNAi mediated gene silencing and have shown that they can moderately influence the mosquitoes' blood feeding behavior. We show that this modulation of the mosquitoes' blood feeding behavior is dependent on light pulse duration and occurs both through clock entrainment mechanisms and by clock independent masking effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] that may occur in a phase dependent or independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The light pulse stimulated alteration of mosquito feeding propensity implicates circadian factors that appear to down-regulate components of the chemosensory system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>The blood feeding behavior of <italic>A. gambiae </italic>is under circadian control</title><p>To test whether <italic>A. gambiae </italic>blood feeding behavior is under circadian control we performed a time-course analysis of blood feeding propensity during a normal LD 12:12 light/dark cycle (12 h light, 12 h dark) and during a DD (dark-dark; continuous 48 hours) cycle to see whether the blood feeding propensity pattern would persist in absence of light (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We were interested in assessing the blood-feeding behavior of mosquitoes when kept in DD for 48 consecutive hours. In LD conditions, blood feeding propensity peaked during late night, at around 5&#x02013;6 h after the light-off transition, and was low during the daytime. The persistence of this pattern even after a 48 h DD condition suggests that blood feeding propensity of mosquitoes is under circadian control. We also performed an experiment where mosquitoes were maintained in a DD condition for 6 days prior to feeding at a day and night time, to assess whether a free-run condition could be reached. These mosquitoes showed feeding behavior that did not correlate with the zeitgeber time-points (as in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and displayed a similar feeding propensity at both ZT19.30 and 28.30 hours, suggesting a free-run condition (data not shown); this finding further validates the circadian nature of blood-feeding behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The blood feeding behavior of <italic>A. gambiae </italic>is under circadian control</bold>.

We investigated the effects of short (5 min) and long (2 h) light pulses, applied during the dark phase at 19.30 hours, on the blood-feeding pattern of mosquitoes in both LD and DD conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). A short light pulse of 5 min resulted in a transient inhibition (~30&#x02013;50%) of blood feeding propensity in mosquitoes, in both LD and DD conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This observation suggests that the shorter light pulse did not evoke a behavioral phase shift, and the inhibition of feeding propensity is likely to reflect a masking effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. On the contrary, a longer 2 h light pulse resulted in an immediate inhibition (~50%) of the blood feeding propensity along with a phase-advance (by ~3&#x02013;4 h) in mosquitoes that were maintained at both the LD and DD conditions (for 48 h), compared to the non-light pulse stimulated mosquitoes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Earlier studies have shown that an early initiation of the light phase results in a phase-advancing effect on mosquito flight activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>We then performed a series of assays to better understand the mechanism mediating the inhibition of blood feeding propensity by shorter light pulses. Light pulses of equal duration (2 min) were applied at different durations (120, 90, 60 and 30 min) prior to blood provision and light onset (at ZT 0) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In separate assays, light pulses of different duration (5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 secs) were applied at a constant duration (-30 min) prior to blood provision and light onset (at ZT 0) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The first set of assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) showed a negative correlation between the duration prior to feeding and the behavioral change as a measure of feeding propensity; the shorter the time between the light pulses and blood provision, the larger the decrease in feeding propensity. Mosquitoes maintained in constant light for 2 h prior to blood provision displayed the same degree of blood feeding inhibition to those exposed to a 2 min light pulse at 30 min prior to blood provision (less by ~55&#x02013;60% compared to the continuous dark control) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Interestingly, even a 2 min light pulse at 120 min prior to the light phase significantly decreased the mosquitoes' feeding propensity when compared to those not exposed to light. The second set of assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) to examine the influence of the light pulse duration on feeding behavior showed that the light pulse duration was positively correlated with the induced behavioral change: the longer the light pulses, the larger the decrease in feeding propensity. A more detailed figure (non-fed, partially fed and fully fed mosquitoes) is presented in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and their corresponding values, standard error and the p-values (T-test) are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> . The light dosage and phase dependent fashion of blood feeding propensity modulation further supports the implication of a phase dependent masking effect rather than a phase advance when mosquitoes are subjected to the two minute short light pulses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Light pulse-induced alteration of <italic>A. gambiae </italic>blood-feeding behavior</bold>.

Mosquitoes were allowed to feed for 10 min and the percentage of fed mosquitoes in each category was scored and plotted. Among the controls were one set that was not exposed to light (continuous dark) and another set that was exposed to continuous light for these 120 min prior to blood provision. B.

Similar artificial membrane-feeding assays were also performed with close proximity (1&#x02013;3 cm) to human hands and continuous human exhalations. These results showed an apparent insensitivity of the mosquitoes to the applied light pulse; the mosquitoes' feeding propensity was largely unaffected by light pulse after this chemosensory over-stimulation (data not shown). However this does not mean that the mosquitoes' feeding behavior upon direct stimulation with a human is not regulated by circadian oscillators that can be manipulated through environmental cues. The exposure of mosquitoes to a human arm or hand and exhalations at a 1- to 3 cm distance is an extreme condition providing maximal concentrations of chemosensory and heat stimulants, while in nature mosquitoes have to sense the human host at a distance of few hundreds to a couple of yards, at conditions that are very likely to be better simulated by a membrane feeding system that only allows for limited chemosensory stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown that the taste receptors in mosquitoes can be induced by phagostimulants such as adenine nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; thus the blood feeding behavior in mosquitoes is a complex process that is regulated by a variety of factors. Host seeking, and hence the blood-feeding propensity of mosquitoes, has also been shown to be stimulated by various cues emitted by the host, such as CO<sub>2</sub>, lactic acid, 1 octen-3-ol, heat and color [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In order to better understand the basis of the mosquitoes' attraction to the blood in the membrane feeding system, which may be regulated by the blood-specific odor, temperature and color, we designed a series of experiments that suggested that the mosquitoes were mainly attracted to a blood-specific chemosensory stimulant through the membrane feeding system (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), and thereby supports the validity of our experimental design.</p></sec><sec><title>Relationships between the light pulse and blood feeding &#x02013; induced transcriptomes</title><p>To identify candidate components of the molecular circuits that mediate the interactions between the light stimulus and the mosquito's host seeking and feeding machinery, we used a microarray-based genome expression approach to assay differences in the mRNA abundance of genes under different light-stimulation (2 min and 2 h) and feeding conditions in whole mosquitoes and the head of both male and female mosquitoes (array-plan design in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).

A significant number of light pulse- and blood feeding-regulated genes were most likely not identified in these assays because of limitations of the microarray methodology to detect mRNA of lower abundance.

The dsRNAs are then taken up by various tissues and cell types. It is reasonable to expect that some tissues, such as the antennae, are less accessible to this dsRNA and would be less susceptible to RNAi-mediated gene silencing because it is more difficult for the double-stranded RNA to diffuse into these body parts from the thoracic hemolymph. Some of these genes are known to be expressed in specific tissues, where they are most likely regulated by peripheral circadian oscillators; others would be expected to display a more general mRNA abundance in multiple tissues. For instance, the obps are known to be mainly localized in the antennae, proboscis, maxillary palps and head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].

While previous studies have described the <italic>A. gambiae </italic>flight activity during the night time and during the twilight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], here we provide insight into the molecular components and mechanisms that regulate the blood feeding behavior. We have shown that the mosquito's blood feeding behavior is under circadian control, with a peak during the late night (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). A short 2 minute light pulses can momentarily decrease the mosquito's blood-feeding propensity in a non-circadian fashion, while a longer light pulse of 2 hours can induce a phase advance phenomenon in the mosquito's feeding behavior, similarly to what has been shown for the circadian regulation on flight activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The short 2-min light pulse can cause a profound change in the mosquito's transcriptome that reflected a modulation of a variety of physiological systems, including those that regulate the mosquito's vectorial capacity. We have mainly focused on transcripts that influence mosquito's feeding behavior; future studies are needed to more clearly define the specific ways in which light can contribute to the regulation of the mosquito's anti-<italic>Plasmodium </italic>defense system and its resistance to infection. The overlap between the light pulse- and blood feeding-induced transcriptomes encompassed a variety of genes, some of which represent molecular links between the mosquito's light sensing and feeding systems. The dosage dependent effect of the short 2-minute light pulse on feeding propensity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) over time suggests it may represent a masking effect which however involves several clock factors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Further detailed studies are required to better understand the impact of a masking mechanism on the mosquito's blood-feeding behavior, and whether this is a phase dependent or independent system. The circadian expression pattern and down-regulation of several <italic>obp </italic>transcripts after light pulse stimulation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), in conjunction with the gene-silencing phenotypes observed for these genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), establishes them as essential factors in the mosquito's host-seeking system and further supports an important role of the mosquito's chemosensory oscillators in the regulation of host seeking and feeding behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Future work should focus on the characterization of these links since a detailed understanding of these interactions can lead to the development of novel malaria control strategies based on interference with the mosquito's host-seeking behavior.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Rearing of <italic>A. gambiae </italic>mosquitoes</title><p><italic>A. gambiae </italic>Keele strain mosquitoes were raised at 27&#x000b0;C and 70% humidity, and adults were maintained on a 10% sucrose solution according to standard rearing condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].

In all assays, the 37&#x000b0;C blood meal was provided by standard artificial membrane feeding system (Parafilm M) for 10 min. The females were first entrained to the 12-h LD cycle of the insectary for 5&#x02013;6 days before any assays were carried out.</p><p>For the time course study of mosquito blood feeding behavior; three mosquito cups (for 3 replicas) were given 37&#x000b0;C blood meal for 10 min, every 3 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The set that was kept in constant DD, three cups for each set were kept in airtight plastic containers covered with aluminum foil for 48 h before the experiment was conducted. Every 3 h during the assay, one box was opened and the mosquitoes were given 37&#x000b0;C blood meal in dark for 10 min. For mosquitoes that were given light pulses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), mosquito cups for each set were kept in separate airtight transparent plastic container (3 replicas for each) and maintained in DD or LD conditions. At or before 19.30 hours, light pulses were given (for 5 min or 2 h), after which blood meal was provided for the next 24 hours, every 3 h. The DD or LD conditions were maintained even during blood-feeding time for all the assays.</p><p>For the light pulse assays in early morning hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>); the night before the assay, each plastic container (containing 3 mosquito cups) was covered with aluminum foil just as the light went off for the night (light intensity in dark was ~1.5 lux). The following day prior to light phase initiation, light pulses were given at different time points and for different durations to each set (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>); by removing the aluminum foil and the cover of the respective boxes. After the light pulses, the boxes were covered with aluminum foil and returned to their original room, which was still in dark. The mosquitoes were given a 37&#x000b0;C blood meal for 10 min, when the light went on in the insectary (ZT 0). After feeding, the mosquitoes were sorted according to the amount of blood they had ingested: those that had not fed at all (non-fed), those with a fully stretched abdomen (fully fed) and those with a small quantity of blood in the abdomen (partially fed) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).

The light pulses were given to each set in a different room, so as to avoid the unnecessary exposure of any other experimental boxes to the light. In addition, all the different mosquito groups were always contained in their respective airtight plastic containers to reduce the exposure of other mosquito sets when working with one particular set.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)</title><p>RNA was extracted and quantified (in triplicate) either from whole mosquitoes or separately from the antennae (also including the maxillary palps and proboscis), the head, and the rest of the body, using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California, USA).

The control samples were non-pulsed and unfed mosquitoes respectively. Sample preparations and microarray hybridizations were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] with the experimental samples being labeled with Cy-3 and control samples being Cy-5 labeled. Scanning and data analyses were performed as previously described with a signal cut-off intensity of 100 to remove low-intensity/poorly hybridized spots from the analysis. Loc-Fit normalization (LOWESS) was performed independently for each data set through MIDAS (available online, TIGR). The TMEV software (available online, TIGR) was then used for SAM analysis with a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). Only transcripts that had signal values above or below the log<sub>2 </sub>cutoff value of &#x000b1; 0.80 were used for further analysis as previously described. The expression data generated by the microarray were validated independently by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) for some of the genes and plotted (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).
