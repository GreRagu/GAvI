We achieved a breakthrough in heat treatment of Buruli ulcer by employing the phase change material sodium acetate trihydrate as a heat application system for thermotherapy, which is widely used in commercial pocket heat pads. It is easy to apply, rechargeable in hot water, non-toxic and non-hazardous to the environment. Six laboratory reconfirmed patients with ulcerative Buruli lesions were included in the proof-of-principle study and treated for four to six weeks. In patients with small ulcers, wounds healed completely without further intervention. Patients with large defects had skin grafting after successful heat treatment. Heat treatment was not associated with marked increases in local inflammation or the development of ectopic lymphoid tissue. One and a half years after completion of treatment, all patients are relapse-free. The reusable phase change material&#x02013;based heat application device appears perfectly suited for use in remote Buruli ulcer&#x02013;endemic areas of countries with limited resources and infrastructure.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Buruli ulcer (BU) is a chronic necrotizing disease of skin and soft tissue caused by <italic>Mycobacterium ulcerans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000380-Johnson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The disease starts as a subcutaneous nodule, papule or plaque that eventually ulcerates and progresses over months to years. In BU lesions, clumps of extra-cellular acid-fast organisms surrounded by areas of necrosis are found primarily in subcutaneous fat tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000380-Hayman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> produces a macrolide toxin, mycolactone, which is associated with tissue destruction and local immunosuppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000380-George1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. BU has been reported in &#x0003e;30 countries, but the major burden lies on children living in remote areas of West Africa associated with swamps and stagnant water bodies. Traditionally wide excision of the infected tissue alone was the standard treatment for BU. This is hampered by traumatic interventions, high cost and very high recurrence rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000380-Walsh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

This characteristic feature of the pathogen was first used for therapeutic purposes in the early 1970s.

The treatment center has a longstanding collaboration with and is supported by Leprosy Relief Emmaus-Switzerland (ALES). It maintains a very well equipped and functioning operation theatre, wards for pre- and postsurgical care, physiotherapy and a school which is of importance because the majority of patients with this disease are children and convalescence after excision of ulcers and skin grafting takes many months in the majority of patients.

Patients with one (patients 1, 2, 3, 4) and with two PCM packs (patient 5) could move around freely and did not feel unacceptably disturbed during their daily activities nor during sleep at night. Patient 6 with four PCM packs also walked with acceptable restrictions and slept largely undisturbed. None of the patients and their guardians requested termination of treatment at any time. Temperatures between 40&#x02013;43&#x000b0;C were observed only for short intervals of time immediately after mounting of the PCM packs without causing unacceptable discomfort. Only initially a few small blisters were occasionally observed.

This has not been carried further into clinical research and practice due to the fact that available heat application systems were cumbersome and not suited for use in developing countries. We achieved a break through by employing PCM packs as a cheap heat application system which is rechargeable in hot water, non-toxic and non-hazardous to the environment. In this proof-of-principle study we demonstrated that our heat application system is easy to use and allows the patient to move freely.</p><p>Family members and the hospital community accepted the treatment very well and favoured it over other treatments currently offered (surgery, antibiotics). Nurses quickly adopted the techniques of mounting the PCM packs and of recharging the packs in boiling water. The only side effects observed were sensation of excessive heat for a short period after applying the PCM packs. Lowering of the temperature at the skin surface by an elastic bandage interposed between tube gauze and PCM packs reliably prevented skin irritation and development of blisters, which may occur if the initial temperature at skin surface is less rigorously controlled.</p><p>With our PCM-based heat application system we reproduced the excellent results of the thermotherapy study of Meyers' group in 1974 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000380-Meyers1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> with significantly shorter heat application times both with respect to length of heat treatment per day (close to 24 hours &#x0005b;39&#x000b0;C&#x02013;40.5&#x000b0;C&#x0005d; vs a mean of 10 hours, range 8.4&#x02013;13.2 hours &#x0005b;&#x02265;39&#x000b0;C&#x0005d;) and to total heat application time (28 to 115 days vs 28 to 55 days). Since both systems worked at the same temperature range measured at skin surface, the minimum length of heat application to achieve healing of BU appears to be in the range of our heat treatment schedule or even shorter.</p><p>The initial clinical improvement of ulcerative lesions in our series was as fast as in the patient series of Meyers et al. As early as three days after initiation of heat treatment undermined ulcer margins collapsed and the skin attached to the underlying subcutaneous tissue with re-epithelialization starting at the edges. Discharge of the wound decreased over various lengths of time. Firm attachment of the affected skin was complete only after discharge stopped. By using heat treatment alone no viable tissue is lost and even the overarching margins at undercutting edges are often rescued. Lesions were clinically inactive in all of our patients with very good granulation and re-epitheliazation responses after 28 days of heat treatment. In one of our patients (patient 6) non-viable tissue extended far beyond the ulcerated area, which had to be excised before skin grafting. In this patient and one other patient with a large defect (patient 5) skin grafting was performed after a good granulation response had been achieved. Currently, all our patients are relapse-free 18 months after completion of heat therapy.</p><p>Rifampicin/streptomycin chemotherapy of BU is associated with the development of ectopic lymphoid tissue in the lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000380-Schuette1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In some patients, effects reminiscent of the immune reconstitution syndromes observed in tuberculosis and leprosy patients after highly active antiretroviral therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000380-Lipman1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> are observed. In contrast, heat treatment did not lead to massive increases in local inflammation and this less vigorous response may favour rapid re-epithelialization. Also haemorrhages, which are regarded as negative indicators for uncomplicated wound healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000380-Waldorf1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> were not observed.</p><p>Results of two pilot studies, the study of Meyers et al. in the 1970s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000380-Meyers1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and our study, demonstrate that heat is a highly efficacious therapy for <italic>M. ulcerans</italic> disease. Use of PCM packs represents a break through for thermotherapy with respect to its practicality in endemic areas with poor infrastructure. Further optimization of the heat treatment schedule should make it suitable for community application.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0000380.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist</p><p>(0.06 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0000380.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0000380.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Study protocol &#x0201c;Phase change material to treat Buruli ulcer through heat treatment&#x0201d;</p><p>(0.09 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0000380.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank engineer Dr. M.
