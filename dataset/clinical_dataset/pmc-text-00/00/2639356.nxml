Lung DC activate an extremely diverse set of gene families but largely preserve a mobile cell profile with high expression levels of integrin and chemokine/chemokine receptors.

After extravasation, PBMo undergo rapid phenotype changes and differentiate into cells of the organ resident mononuclear phagocyte system, namely macrophages (M&#x003d5;) and dendritic cells (DC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This highly coordinated process implicates close linkage between monocyte trafficking and cellular differentiation, which shapes the phenotype of the extravasated cells. Monocyte differentiation has been extensively studied <italic>in vitro</italic>. Monocytes cultured in medium containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) differentiate into M&#x003d5;, while in the presence of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and Interleukin (IL) -4, monocytes differentiate into DC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although recent <italic>in vivo </italic>investigations have demonstrated that subsets of PBMo can be precursors for DC and M&#x003d5; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the detailed fate of PBMo once they leave the circulation has not been comprehensively addressed. Moreover, while cell recruitment under inflammatory conditions has been extensively studied, the tissue migration and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes under non-inflammatory conditions remain poorly understood.</p><p>In the lung, cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system are key players in host defense and immunological homeostasis. While M&#x003d5; are generally present in both the lung interstitium and alveolar airspaces, DC are mainly located within the interstitium with only a minor proportion found at the respiratory tract surface areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition to their different localization, M&#x003d5; and DC in the lung fulfill distinct and specialized roles in the immune response, which correlate with their different migration properties and cellular phenotypes. In the absence of inflammatory stimuli, DC have a much shorter half-life in the lung compared to M&#x003d5; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, DC do not exhibit impressive phagocytic activity, but rather process antigens which are then presented to T cells upon stimulation, causing antigen specific T cell priming. To ensure an effective antigen presentation to T cells, DC must migrate to the regional lymph nodes. In contrast, M&#x003d5; are considered to form resident cell populations both in the interstitium (interstitial macrophages, iM&#x003d5;) and in the alveolar airspace (resident alveolar macrophages, rAM), where they function as major sentinel and phagocytic population of the lung for invading pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Alveolar macrophage and DC precursors must migrate from the bloodstream through endothelial and epithelial barriers into the alveolar compartment. This journey requires the expression of genes involved in communication with barrier structures and rapid adjustment to different oxygen concentrations and osmotic pressures.</p><p>Trafficking of monocytes into lung tissue and their differentiation into lung resident M&#x003d5; and DC is supposed to be regulated by the expression of specific gene clusters, which promote cell-cell interaction, migration and matrix degradation and the acquisition of tissue specific cellular phenotypes. Traffic related gene clusters include chemokines, integrins, and tissue-degrading matrix metallopeptidases (Mmps), for all of which members have been shown to be functionally important. A complete picture, however, of the gene clusters that are regulated during <italic>in vivo </italic>migration and differentiation of PBMo under non-inflammatory conditions has not yet been obtained. Currently, adaptive changes of cellular phenotypes cannot be directly assessed by cell fate mapping during the slow trafficking of mononuclear phagocytes to lung tissue under steady-state conditions. Therefore, as an alternative approach to gain a better insight into the genetic programs that drive the mononuclear phagocyte migration and differentiation processes, the transcriptomes of circulating monocytes were compared with their lung tissue mononuclear phagocyte progeny. By this approach, gene clusters related to cell migration were identified and confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis that are differentially expressed between PBMo versus lung M&#x003d5; and DC, and which shape the mononuclear phagocyte phenotyes in the circulation and in the lung tissue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Experiments were performed with wild-type C57BL/6N mice (six to nine weeks old), which were purchased from Charles River (Sulzbach, Germany) and were maintained under specific pathogen free conditions with free access to food and water.

Erythrolysis was performed with 10 ml 0.8% ammonium chloride lysis buffer. Erythrolysis was stopped by addition of 5 ml of RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and L-glutamine, and cells were centrifuged (400 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>, 10 min, 4&#x000b0;C).

Lungs were minced and cut into small pieces, agitated on a shaker (30 min, RT) and then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cell aggregates were dispersed by repeated passage through a syringe, and filtered through a 200 &#x003bc;m and a 40 &#x003bc;m cell strainer (BD Biosciences), to obtain single cell suspension. Subsequently, cells were rinsed with HBSS and PBS/2 mM EDTA/0.5% FCS, followed by incubation with an excess concentration of unspecific IgG (Octagam, Octapharma, Germany) to reduce non-specific antibody binding. After washing with PBS/2 mM EDTA/0.5% FCS, cells were stained with magnetic bead-conjugated anti-CD11c antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec) followed by magnetic separation according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, the cell population (containing CD11c positive cells) was stained with CD11c-PE conjugated antibodies (BD Pharmingen) and sorted as outlined below.</p><p>To obtain resident alveolar macrophages, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed with 500 &#x003bc;l aliquots of sterile PBS/2 mM EDTA (pH 7.2) until a BAL fluid (BALF) volume of 5 ml was recovered following previously described protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The BALF was centrifuged (400 &#x000d7; g, 10 min, 4&#x000b0;C); the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS/2 mM EDTA/0.5% FCS, stained with CD11c PE conjugated antibodies (BD Pharmingen) and subjected to sorting.</p></sec><sec><title>Flow cytometric analysis and flow sorting</title><p>For staining for flow cytometric analysis and sorting, cells were resuspended in PBS/2 mM EDTA/0.5% FCS.

From one mouse, three different cell types, namely PBMo, M&#x003d5;, and DC, were sorted as outlined above, and RNA was extracted. In order to get enough RNA for a labeling reaction, RNA was pooled from 4 different extractions (4 mice, one pool). Two pools of labeled amplified RNA (aRNA) from different cell types were used per microarray hybridization (one per dye to reach a balanced dye swap, see below).

Per reaction, 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA was used. The samples were labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 to match a balanced dye-swap design. The Cy3- and Cy5-labeled RNA pools were hybridized overnight to 4 &#x000d7; 44 K 60 mer oligonucleotide spotted microarray slides (Mouse Whole Genome 4 &#x000d7; 44 K; Agilent Technologies).

Lung DC primarily exhibited an immature phenotype, as defined by high expression of MHCII and intermediate expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Neither an expression of CD115 nor of neutrophil, T cell, B cell, or NK cell markers was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The purity of sorted cells used for the microarray experiments (PBMo, lung DC and lung M&#x003d5;) was assessed by flow cytometry and Pappenheim-stained cytospins and was always &#x02265; 98%. As sample processing may alter the gene expression profile of primary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], every effort was made to minimize processing time and, where possible, all procedures were performed on ice.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Identification and characterization of lung M&#x003d5; and DC by flow cytometry</bold>. <bold>A) </bold>CD11c positive cells were obtained from lung homogenate by magnetic bead isolation, stained for CD11c, and analyzed by flow cytometry.

For each comparison, four hybridizations were performed. Genes that exhibited a greater than two-fold change in expression were considered as being differentially expressed, as described in the Materials and Methods section. Among the genes differentially expressed between lung M&#x003d5; and PBMo, 1530 genes were up-regulated, and 1440 genes were down-regulated. Comparing lung DC and PBMo, 1271 genes were up-regulated, and 341 were down-regulated. Furthermore, 832 genes were found to be up-regulated and 1565 genes down-regulated between lung M&#x003d5; and DC. An analysis of the correlation of the M values for the regulated genes from the different hybridizations showed a high correlation with an average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.95, indicating a high consistency between the four hybridizations per group. In a pathway analysis, using <italic>Pathway-Express from Onto-Tools</italic>, the cell adhesion molecule pathway was the most differentially regulated pathway in all comparisons. The antigen presentation and processing pathway was the second most differentially regulated pathway comparing lung M&#x003d5; versus DC and DC versus PBMo.</p><p>To further analyze and structure the microarray data, and to address the question of which gene clusters and cellular pathways are regulated during the extravasations and lung tissue differentiation process of mononuclear phagocytes, particular attention was paid to genes involved in cell trafficking, namely integrins, metallopeptidases, chemokines and chemokine receptors, as well as interleukins and interleukin receptors (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In order to visualize the results, volcano plots were created with depicted genes belonging to each cluster (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The highlighted genes were validated on independently sorted samples by qRT-PCR and demonstrated the same expression trends as the microarray results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). It must be noted, however, that the log intensity ratios (i.e. the coefficients displayed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) obtained from the microarray experiments after RNA preamplification do not directly equal the &#x00394;Ct values obtained from the qRT-PCR validation. This is a well-known phenomenon and due to partly not well understood factors such as the preamplification procedure itself and the limited dynamic range of fluorescence detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Due to this, &#x00394;Ct values obtained from the qRT-PCR analysis were often found to be higher than the coefficients for the same genes obtained from the microarray analysis. Likewise, by qRT-PCR analysis there were significant expression differences detectable in certain genes that had not been detected by the array experiments (Table <xref ref-type="table"

Thus, the two dominant subpopulations of PBMo, the "inflammatory" (GR-1<sup>pos</sup>) and the "resident" (GR-1<sup>neg</sup>) subsets, have been attributed with different biological functions, including recruitment under inflammatory versus steady-state conditions, and differentiation into functionally different DC and M&#x003d5; populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To further identify possible differences in the expression profiles of the selected genes, GR-1<sup>high </sup>and GR-1<sup>low </sup>PBMo were sorted for qRT-PCR analysis based on the expression of CD11b, CD115 and GR-1, as depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>. Like PBMo, lung M&#x003d5; can be divided into two major populations according to their anatomical location, the parenchymal or interstitial M&#x003d5; (iM&#x003d5;), and the resident alveolar macrophages (rAM). Whether these populations represent functionally different subpopulations has long been a matter of debate. Recent reports, however, indicate a functional and developmental difference, with the iM&#x003d5; being proposed as precursor cells for rAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. For the separation of rAM, BALF was obtained from mouse lungs, and rAM were flow-sorted from the lavage by gating the high FL1 autofluorescent, CD11c<sup>pos </sup>cell population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). By lavaging one can remove &#x0003e; 90% of the alveolar macrophages from mouse lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the current experiments, the lavage procedure depleted rAM efficiently from the lungs thus enriching the iM&#x003d5; subset, following an approach used by Landsman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. No additional rAM could be obtained by serial lavage, indicating an efficient lavaging procedure. Enriched interstitial M&#x003d5; and DC were then isolated from homogenates obtained from lavaged lungs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>) using the sorting strategy described above (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Isolation strategy of subpopulations of PBMo and lung M&#x003d5;</bold>. <bold>A) </bold>PBMo were flow-sorted from peripheral blood leukocytes by gating on the low SSC/CD11b<sup>pos</sup>/CD115<sup>pos </sup>population, as shown in Fig. 1.

Recent reports highlight the role of PBMo that emigrate into the lung and differentiate into both lung DC and M&#x003d5;, thereby serving as a constant supply for the renewal of the lung DC and M&#x003d5; pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. While many studies have investigated monocyte recruitment under inflammatory conditions, little is known about the pathways mediating monocyte trafficking and differentiation in lung tissue under non-inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Since PBMo are believed to be precursors for lung M&#x003d5; and DC, a global gene expression profiling approach was chosen to reveal crucial differences between these cell types, to better understand their relation to one another, and to identify gene clusters relevant for the migration and differentiation process that takes place under steady-state conditions. Previous microarray studies investigating the relation, differentiation and/or maturation of monocytes, macrophages and DC have been mainly conducted <italic>in vitro </italic>using both murine and human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A study comparing primary human AM versus AM differentiated <italic>in vitro </italic>from PBMo has demonstrated significant differences in gene expression profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], indicating the necessity of carefully elaborating the differences and similarities between <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>differentiation. A recent publication from our group compared gene expression profiles of murine mononuclear phagocytes recruited to the alveolar space under non-inflammatory and inflammatory conditions using 1 K nylon arrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The present study was undertaken as the first <italic>in vivo </italic>investigation using cell specific whole genome expression profiling of key players in lung immunity, namely lung M&#x003d5; and lung DC and their circulating precursors PBMo, to define the gene expression differences between these three cell populations under non-inflammatory conditions in mice. By this, it could be demonstrated that approximately 5&#x02013;10% of all genes are differentially regulated between these three cell populations which are closely related with respect to origin, destination and function. Whether these expression differences represent preformed, lineage-specific differentiation programs or are rather due to the interaction of migrating PBMo and specific micro-environmental factors of the lung must be addressed in detail in subsequent studies.</p><p>The gene expression patterns obtained from our study suggest that lung DC are phenotypically closer related to PBMo than lung tissue M&#x003d5;. When further comparing the transcriptional regulation of selected genes in the lung macrophage subpopulations iM&#x003d5; and rAM by qRT PCR, the transcripts of CCR2, CCL2, CCR7 and CD61 all highly expressed in PBMo were found to be less downregulated in iM&#x003d5; compared to rAM. This finding supports a recent report by Landsman <italic>et al</italic>., suggesting that iM&#x003d5; are an intermediate stage in the differentiation process to rAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>An important issue when interpreting DNA microarray data is whether mRNA expression levels demonstrates the same expression trends as the expression of the encoded proteins. Notably, the transcriptional expression patterns of selected integrins obtained by DNA array and qRT-PCR were found to demonstrete the same expression trend as the expression levels of the respective proteins on the cell surface as detected by flow cytometry.</p><p>Lung DC and M&#x003d5; play diverse functional roles in innate immunity, and their localization to different compartments of the lung suggests different migration properties of these cell types. Under steady-state conditions, DC largely reside in the interstitial compartment, with only minor parts located in the alveolar space, and ultimately they emigrate to the thoracic lymph nodes to present antigen to T cells. Conversely, M&#x003d5; readily pass through the epithelial barrier and enter the alveolar airspaces, which very likely represents a terminal destination. Hypothesizing that DC and rAM residing in different environments most likely require different migration and tissue invasion capacities, differentially expressed genes were grouped into trafficking related clusters such as integrins, Mmps, chemokine and chemokine receptors, and interleukins and interleukin receptors. Integrins are key mediators of cell-cell interactions, and given their different tissue localization, DC and M&#x003d5; most likely have to interact with different cell types or the extracellular matrix (ECM). Indeed, the paucity of integrin gene expression in rAM as compared to PBMo and lung DC suggests that rAM require less integrin-mediated cell-cell communication, which is consistent with the view of rAM being confined to the alveolar space, rather than possessing extensive migratory properties. Members of the MMP family can cleave components of the ECM, thereby facilitating cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, Mmps can modulate the activity of chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and selectins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Chemokines themselves also regulate Mmps and integrin avidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The different biological functions of DC and M&#x003d5; would imply that these cell types have different interactions with their direct environment, suggesting the differential expression of genes that regulate cell interaction with the ECM, and responses to chemokines and cytokines. Our data show that DC and M&#x003d5; express different clusters of MMP as well as cytokine and chemokine receptor genes, indicating distinct patterns of migration properties.</p><p>It has previously been shown that Mmp2 and Mmp9 are critically required by DC for recruitment to the airways in a murine model of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and for the migration of DC from the skin to lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. While a difference in gene expression of Mmp2 and Mmp9 between lung DC and lung M&#x003d5; could not be demonstrated by microarray, five members of the Mmp family, Adam19, Adam23, Mmp12, Mmp13 and Mmp14 were identified, which were dramatically upregulated in lung DC versus M&#x003d5;, while Mmp19 was upregulated in both iM&#x003d5; and rAM, compared to DC. In contrast, expression of Mmps except Mmp8, Mmp19 and Adam19 in PBMo was low or not detectable, indicating that the transcriptional upregulation of these highly active enzymes is an important and immediate step in the differentiation process after PBMo emigration from the blood into the lung. However, the exact role played by these differentially expressed members of the Mmp family in cell migration, phagocytosis and antigen processing has to be further delineated. Similarly, the mechanisms by which Mmps regulate the function of chemokines, cytokines, and integrin expression, which influence DC and M&#x003d5; migration and activity, also await elucidation. Another important aspect of this study is the detailed delineation of the expression pattern of chemokines and their receptors in PBMo, lung M&#x003d5; and lung DC under non-inflammatory conditions. The microarray and qRT-PCR analyses demonstrate that all three cell populations express a variety of both chemokines and receptors. The qRT-PCR analysis of the mRNA levels in iM&#x003d5; and rAM, however, indicates a more active participation in chemokine production by the iM&#x003d5; than by the rAM population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the gene expression profile of the major phagocytotic and antigen-presenting cells of the lung, M&#x003d5; and DC, and their putative precursor cells, monocytes from peripheral blood, on a whole-genome scale under non-inflammatory, steady-state conditions. The diversity of genes differentially regulated in the investigated clusters was found to be largest in DC corresponding to their volatility and multiple functions in antigen uptake, processing and subsequent presentation. In addition, DC preserve the high expression level of integrin and chemokine/chemokine receptor genes found in PBMo whereas lung M&#x003d5; display much lower transcript levels of these traffic related molecules. As previously poorly investigated players in pulmonary mononuclear phagocyte function, transcript levels of most members of the Mmp family were low or not detectable in PBMo, but were found to be strongly upregulated in both lung DC and M&#x003d5;, however with a unique expression pattern of distinct Mmp family members in both cell types potentially related to cell type specific functions in lung tissue that has to be delineated in further studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ZZ carried out the experimental work and drafted the manuscript.
