Since the transcriptional functions of &#x003b2;-catenin are more often implicated in various disease processes, there is much interest in the development and use of reagents to interrogate spatial and temporal evidence of &#x003b2;-catenin nuclear signaling in cells and tissues. An important study demonstrated that the signaling form of &#x003b2;-catenin is specifically unphosphorylated at residues S37 and T41, and suggested that this form exhibits a propensity for cytosolic/nuclear accumulation relative to the total pool of &#x003b2;-catenin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show that monoclonal antibody, 8E7, which recognizes the signaling form of &#x003b2;-catenin specifically unphosphorylated at S37 and T41 (Active B-Catenin, ABC), also cross-reacts with a widely expressed, variably accessible nuclear antigen that is not &#x003b2;-catenin.

When &#x003b2;-catenin interacts with cadherin adhesion receptors, it serves to critically link these receptors to the cytoskeleton (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). In the nucleus, &#x003b2;-catenin partners with LEF/TCF-family DNA-binding proteins, forming an essential link between their DNA-binding function and the recruitment of factors required for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). In most cell types, the adhesive function of &#x003b2;-catenin predominates, due to the constant synthesis of cadherin/catenin complexes during steady-state conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. During tissue development and repair, a cadherin-free, cytosolic form of &#x003b2;-catenin is generated by extracellular Wnt ligands. These Wnts engage cell surface receptors to initiate a signal transduction pathway that largely serves to promote the post-transcriptional stabilization and nuclear localization &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recruitment of &#x003b2;-catenin to LEF/TCF-bound promoters ultimately leads to the activation of genes required for distinct cellular outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>While cytosolic stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin has long been considered a hallmark of Wnt-activation, it is now appreciated that &#x003b2;-catenin which remains hypophosphorylated within the GSK3&#x003b2;-consensus region constitutes the signaling form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Strong evidence for this model has relied on the generation of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), which was screened to recognize a peptide corresponding to &#x003b2;-catenin (amino acid residues 36&#x02013;44), specifically when T41 and S37 are <italic>not </italic>phosphorylated (8E7, Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). This antibody recognizes the signaling Active form of &#x003b2;-Catenin, or ABC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Since this reagent allows investigators to examine changes in &#x003b2;-catenin N-terminal modification using simple immuno-detection methods, it has become a popular tool to begin explorations into whether a cell has been the recipient of a Wnt or Wnt-like activity. A similarly named monoclonal antibody, 8E4, is incorrectly marketed as an antibody that also recognizes &#x003b2;-catenin "non-phosphorylated" at the N-terminal GSK sites, and has recently been shown to recognize &#x003b2;-catenin at a completely different epitope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>As part of our own efforts to understand how phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin's N-terminus alters its nuclear signaling activities, we discovered that while mAb 8E7 indeed recognizes cytoplasmic/nuclear ABC, this antibody also cross-reacts with a nuclear antigen in a number of cell types. Because nuclear staining persists in a cell line where the &#x003b2;-catenin gene is deleted by homologous recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we know that this nuclear antigen is not &#x003b2;-catenin. This study offers two ways to improve the reliable use of this antibody. First, cadherin overexpression analysis can be used to deplete a nuclear signal that is due to ABC. Second, milder antigen retrieval methods appear to reduce the accessibility of mAb 8E7 to this cross-reacting nuclear antigen.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Through our efforts to understand how the N-terminally, hypophosphorylated form of &#x003b2;-catenin is regulated, particularly in the context of fibrotic disorders where this pathway has been recently shown to play a causal role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we discovered that primary lung fibroblasts exhibited strong nuclear staining using the ABC antibody (data not shown). This either suggested that our fibroblast cultures were in a state of constitutive, Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling activation or, alternately, raised questions about the specificity of mAb 8E7 in these cells. To address this, we subjected HEK293T cells to Wnt pathway activation using lithium chloride as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], followed by immunofluorescence double-labeling with the antibody that specifically recognizes &#x003b2;-catenin that remains unphosphorylated at S37 and T41 (mAb 8E7), and an antibody that presumably recognizes all forms of &#x003b2;-catenin (#06-734; Millipore). While lithium chloride clearly increased the nuclear/cytoplasmic staining observed with both antibodies, substantial nuclear staining using the ABC antibody was observed in uninduced HEK293T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref>). Short-term exposure of HEK cells with recombinant Wnt3a protein induced ABC protein levels comparable to LiCl-treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). No obvious increase in nuclear ABC was observed with after incubation with recombinant Wnt3a protein, or transient transfection with a Wnt3a encoding plasmid (not shown). Altogether, these results show that while mAb 8E7 readily recognizes ABC by immunoblot analysis, the high level of background nuclear staining obscures the detection of ABC by immunofluorescence analysis.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization of signaling and total forms of &#x003b2;-catenin in HEK 293T cells</bold>. <bold>A-C</bold>: HEK 293T cells were treated with 30 mM NaCl (control, <bold>A</bold>) or 30 mM LiCl (B) for 16 hours to induce the post-transcriptional accumulation of cytosolic/nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin. Cells were co-immunostained using a polyclonal antibody raised against the consensus GSK3 phosphorylation sites of human &#x003b2;-catenin (#06-734; Millipore), and a monoclonal antibody that recognizes ABC (8E7, Millipore). DAPI was used to stain cell nuclei. <bold>A</bold>. NaCl (control)-treated cells display a small amount of junctional and cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin (green), while ABC (red) is found exclusively in the nuclear compartment. <bold>B</bold>. In the presence of Wnt signaling, cells show increased expression and colocalization of total-&#x003b2;-catenin and ABC in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Note that the punctate, nuclear ABC staining remains largely unchanged after LiCl induction (arrowheads). Rather, a diffuse cyto/nucleoplasmic ABC staining pattern is most evident (arrows in B). No staining is observed with goat-anti-rabbit IgG (GAR) and goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM) secondary antibodies alone (not shown).

Note that 8E7 detects ABC as well as a non-specific band at ~160 kDa (*).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6150-4-5-1"/></fig><p>To interrogate the specificity of mAb 8E7, we subjected two cell lines that express no &#x003b2;-catenin protein to immunofluorescence and Western blotting analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Mouse L cells are a fibroblastic line that produces little &#x003b2;-catenin protein due to an absence of cadherin expression and constitutive turnover of newly synthesized &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. While the stable transfection of Wnt3a plasmid results in the upregulation of both total and hypophosphorylated forms of &#x003b2;-catenin by immunoblotting, confirming that these cells can respond to a Wnt signal appropriately (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), there is a strong nuclear staining pattern detected by 8E7 in control L cells that remains unaltered by the presence of Wnt3a (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). These data suggest that the nuclear staining observed with 8E7 may not be due to &#x003b2;-catenin. To address this more definitively, we used a cell line where both &#x003b2;-catenin, and the related plakoglobin, genes are deleted through homologous recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. While &#x003b2;-catenin/plakoglobin null F9 cells exhibit no &#x003b2;-catenin protein by immunoblot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), a diffuse nuclear staining pattern remains when these cells are stained with mAb 8E7. Together, these data demonstrate that 8E7 cross-reacts with a nuclear antigen that is not &#x003b2;-catenin.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Nuclear staining associated with mAb 8E7 is observed in &#x003b2;-catenin null cells</bold>. <bold>A&#x00026;B</bold>: Mouse L cell fibroblasts +/- Wnt3a <bold>A</bold>.

Corresponding immunoblot shows that 8E7 detects a non-specific band at ~160 kDa in F9 cells (*). It is unclear whether this non-specific band contributes to background nuclear staining.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6150-4-5-2"/></fig><p>While 8E7 non-specifically detects nuclei, this signal is relatively weak compared with cell lines that show strong activation of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling, such as the widely used human colon cancer cell line, SW480 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). To prove that the nuclear signal observed in SW480 cells is indeed due to &#x003b2;-catenin, we stably reintroduced E-cadherin into these cells and observed a nearly complete depletion of the nuclear ABC signal, and recruitment to cell-cell junctions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Redistribution of the ABC signal was not observed when E-cadherin was expressed in mouse L cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), consistent with data showing that this nuclear signal is not due to &#x003b2;-catenin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Since the &#x003b2;-catenin specific and non-specific staining patterns observed with 8E7 are qualitatively indistinguishable, definitive detection of nuclear localized ABC can be confirmed through an ability of classical cadherins to sequester this form of &#x003b2;-catenin to cell junctions.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Assessment of nuclear localized ABC can be verified by cadherin-mediated depletion of the nuclear signal</bold>. <bold>A&#x00026;B</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Double-immunolabeling of ABC (red; 1300 ms) in mouse L cells transiently transfected with E-cadherin (green; 984 ms). Note that in contrast with SW480s, nuclear staining in L cells cannot be depleted by cadherin expression (arrows).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6150-4-5-3"/></fig><p>The original description of mAb 8E7 showed that this antibody could detect the signaling form of &#x003b2;-catenin in developing intestinal crypts by standard immunohistochemical analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. More recently, this antibody has been used in adult liver, where it revealed a gradient of ABC staining along the perivenous/periportal axis to control the expression of genes required for ammonia detoxification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In other studies, nuclear staining with mAb 8E7 was observed after genetic loss of components that inhibit &#x003b2;-catenin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Through our own efforts to use this antibody to identify epithelial cell types maintained by &#x003b2;-catenin signaling in adult lung, we found that mAb 8E7 could detect all nuclei within the section (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). In striking contrast, this non-specific nuclear staining pattern was not observed when sections were treated with milder antigen retrieval methods, such as boiling citrate buffer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Instead, these latter conditions revealed a diffuse cytoplasmic/nuclear staining within a subpopulation of cells, similar to what was observed in intestinal crypts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The staining in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> is also consistent with evidence that the lung airway epithelium contains progenitors that can undergo renewal after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], as well as our own data showing that these lung airway cells are sensitive to Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway activation using the Axin2-<sup>LacZ/+ </sup>reporter mouse (Flozak and Lam* et al., unpublished). Taken altogether, the variable accessibility of this cross-reacting nuclear antigen may explain differences in detecting a specific nuclear ABC signal over this background antigen (e.g., Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> versus (1)).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Detection of ABC depends on antigen retrieval method</bold>. <bold>A-D </bold>Rat lung paraffin sections.

These findings demonstrate that the ability of 8E7 to accurately capture evidence of Wnt signaling in cells or tissues critically depends on the strength and/or duration of the Wnt signal, relative to the accessibility of this background antigen. In cell cultures, nuclear accumulation of ABC can be easily verified by cadherin over-expression and redistribution of ABC to cell-cell junctions. In tissue sections, the non-specific nuclear staining can be reduced by use of gentler antigen retrieval methods.

Their analysis clearly demonstrates that the 8E7 antibody cross-reacts with a non-specific protein antigen in cells that lack beta-catenin expression.</p><p>Specifically data shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, demonstrate that L cells express low levels of beta-catenin which is dramatically increased upon treatment with Wnt-3a. However, staining with 8E7 remains high with or without Wnt-3a expression. These data are further supported with similar observations in F9 cells in which expression of beta- and gamma-catenin is deleted by homologous recombination. I agree with the conclusion of the authors that this antibody should be used with caution, especially for immunohistochemical analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Reviewer 2</title><p>Frank J.T. Staal</p><p>Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands</p><sec><title>Reviewer Comment #1</title><p>The 8E7 antibody, developed in the laboratory of Dr. Hans Clevers recognizes the dephosphorylated N-terminus of &#x003b2;-catenin, the signalling competent form of &#x003b2;-catenin. This reagent was developed in order to better follow the fate of canonical Wnt signalling at the protein level, rather than simply assaying for increased levels of total or nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin which can occur independently of active Wnt signalling (as for instance elegantly shown by M. Waterman&#x000ed;s lab). The development of these types of reagents was first described by Mascha van Noort et al in JBC and further on one of the developed antibodies, 8E7 or anti-ABC (activated-beta-catenin) was shown to report active Wnt signalling and (Staal et al, EMBO REP), but not increases in &#x003b2;-catenin by other means. It has been described before in the JBC paper that 8E7 also recognizes a ubiquitous, apparently non-Wnt regulated protein of higher MW (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> of that paper), but for most applications that has not been a problem, certainly in protein blots, but also in immuno fluorescence applications when done as originally described.</p><p>Cara Gottardi and co-workers now describe in a series of carefully conducted experiments that other antigen retrieval methods would lead to detection of this ubiquitous protein, which could confuse researchers and therefore is a worthwhile caveat to report. The authors should mention the main confusion surrounding this antibody has been the inappropriate marketing of a pan-&#x003b2;-catenin antibody advertised as also recognizing dephosphorylated &#x003b2;-catenin (which it does not do) with the similar name of 8E4. Despite a clarification we published last year in Blood, the incorrect antibody still appears every now and then in the literature. Besides that, 8E7 recognizes this "variably accessible" nuclear antigen that is not &#x003b2;-catenin, but it also correctly recognizes dephosphorylated &#x003b2;-catenin, and thus far is still the best reagent we have.</p></sec><sec><title>Our response</title><p>Frank Staal raises an important issue that merits clarification. Some anti-&#x003b2;-catenin antibodies are currently marketed by companies as "non-phospho" or "de-phospho" &#x003b2;-catenin (e.g., mAb 8E4, #05-601 and polyclonal Ab #06-734, respectively; Millipore). With regards to 8E4, a recent clarification published by the Staal group showed that 8E4 recognizes an epitope that lies well outside the GSK3 regulatory region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This clarification is yet to be incorporated into the company's data sheet for 8E4. With regards to Ab #06-734, although this antibody was <italic>raised against </italic>a peptide antigen corresponding to &#x003b2;-catenin's unphosphorylated GSK3 sites, this antibody should not be confused with an antibody like 8E7, which was <italic>specifically screened to only recognize </italic>&#x003b2;-catenin proteins that are unphosphorylated at certain GSK3 residues. In other words, the "non-phospho" status of an antigen does not ensure that the antibodies that recognize this region will only recognize the non-phosphorylated protein. Rather, a rigorous screening method (as part of the selection of 8E7, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]) is required to ensure specific recognition of unphosphorylated epitopes.</p></sec><sec><title>Reviewer comment #2</title><p>That a similar epitope is recognized by an antibody can be a problem under conditions with low active Wnt signals, is obvious. The notion that there is some background staining in unstimulated 293T cells, was reported previously (Staal et al, EMBO REP) and with strong activation signals a clear increase is seen. I think it would be helpful if authors would include an experiment with milder Wnt stimulation, for instance by transfecting Wnt1 into 293T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Our response</title><p>We concur with the reviewer's statement that all antibodies cross-react with epitopes from other proteins, and that it is the responsibility of the investigator to understand the specific "signal-to-noise" ratio in their particular system. With regards to the non-specific nuclear staining associated with 8E7, titrating the antibody to reduce this background (reducing "noise"), or robustly activating the pathway (increasing "signal"), can certainly help. But not all cell systems can be manipulated this way. In this regard, Staal et al. nicely demonstrate that activation of HEK cells with Wnt-1 revealed enhanced nuclear staining with mAb 8E7 over the uninduced condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, we could not see this enhanced nuclear accumulation of ABC in HEK cells treated with LiCl or Wnt3a (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). It is possible that our laboratories are working with different subclones of HEK293 cells that exhibit different sensitivities to Wnt pathway activation. Alternatively, the accessibility of the cross-reacting nuclear antigen may depend on cell plating, fixation and permeability conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Reviewer comment #3</title><p>I fully agree that besides antibody staining other methods to measure Wnt activity should be used, but a cautionary note should be added that even the so-called universal Wnt target genes (such as Axin2) may a) be regulated by other signals as well b) not always show up in all tissues as target genes (as is our experience). If authors can correct these points I see no reasons to object to publishing a cautionary report that when inappropriately used or with low Wnt signals, care should be taken one is actually measuring canonical Wnt signalling.</p></sec><sec><title>Our response</title><p>While negative feedback regulators of Wnt pathway activation like Axin2, naked and DKK <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/pathways/targetcomp.html"/> tend to be more generally expressed across different cell types, we acknowledge the reviewer's point that there may be no "universal" Wnt pathway target gene(s). Thus, Wnt-activated targets for a particular cell and tissue type must be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Reviewer 3</title><p>Manabu Sugai</p><p>Kyoto University, Center For Genomic Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine</p></sec><sec><title>General comments</title><p>In this study, the authors have shown that monoclonal antibody 8E7 recognizes not only &#x003b2;-catenin but also other nuclear molecule(s) in some cell lines. From these observations, they recommend milder antigen retrieval method for tissue section staining using this antibody. However, this condition is very similar as described in Dr. Clevers's lab (J Biol Chem 277, 17901). There are some novel findings that are of interest, but the significance of the findings is not clear and the proposed procedures in using this antibody are not so informative comparing to the previous one.</p><p>To determine the significance of weak signals appeared in some staining experiments is not easy. Usually, we determine the meaning of it by considering the data from the other kinds of experiments. As shown in this manuscript, translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin to cell surface by enforced expression of E-cadherin is used for it (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C, D</xref>). However, nuclear signals appeared in HEK293T cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. ABC staining) don't indicate the active &#x003b2;-catenin, because there is no transcriptional activity of TCF-dependent reporter construct as shown by the previous work (EMBO report 3, 63&#x02013;68, 2002). So extensive characterization of monoclonal antibody 8E7 is only useful if there is no way to examine the activity of Wnt signaling, like immunohistochemical study.</p><p>From this point of view, the authors show the reasonable imunohistochemical staining data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) using 8E7 antibody in the similar manner (using citrate buffer) as previously shown by Dr. Clevers (J Biol Chem 277, 17901). In addition, they estimate their procedure's accuracy by comparing the similar staining patterns observed by Dr. Clevers (J Biol Chem 277, 17901). These facts indicate that the author's information provided in this manuscript is not enough for wide range of readers.</p><p>I speculate that what the authors want to say in this manuscript is the signals observed using 8E7 antibody would make some troubles in estimating actual Wnt activity. So I want to know such situations. If the amount is not enough to detect using any experimental procedures, non-specific signals will appear by enhancing the signals. Accordingly, I think that the author's idea will be easily accepted by the readers if the authors will show some examples of the difficulty in discriminating the signals of ABC and those of non-specific. However, the author performed their experiment mainly using L cells. In L cells, the amount of non-phosphorylated &#x003b2;-catenin is very low and slight induction can be seen by Wnt3a expression (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In addition, the ABC signals observed in L cells is not so strong as that of SW480 cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), which express much amount of unphosphorylated &#x003b2;-catenin as shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>. Therefore, I suggest that the authors should show additional experimental results using L cells and/or 293T cells stimulated with LiCl (Western blotting and Immunofluorescence staining of these cells using 8E7). The details of staining procedure, magnification of the photo and the exposure time should be shown. If the authors succeed in showing the difficulty of assessing the ABC amount by immunostaining, then the authors need to show the way to overcome this by improving their staining protocol. If the authors successfully show these issues, their results will be very informative for many readers.</p></sec><sec><title>Specific points</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>: It would be better to show the magnification and exposure time.</p><sec><title>Our response</title><p>We firmly agree with the reviewer's acknowledgment that most antibodies cross-react with epitopes present within other proteins. We also agree that we need to establish under what specific conditions this can be a problem. We now show in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, immunoblots indicating that the induction of ABC by LiCl or Wnt3a treatment <italic>is similar in abundance to </italic>the non-specific band (*) in HEK cells. While we cannot say that the ~160 kDa species is the cross-reacting nuclear antigen (e.g., the nuclear antigen could be a &#x0003e; 250 kDa protein not detected by our gel/transfer protocols), this blot <italic>does </italic>show that the "signal-to-noise" ratio in Wnt/LiCl-treated HEK cells is low (i.e., ABC: 160 kDa species is 1:1). Unless a cell type has an abundance of ABC relative to this background nuclear antigen (or high "signal to noise" ratio), it will be difficult to know whether a nuclear ABC signal is truly due to ABC, outside of the cadherin-sequestration experiment proposed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. At the reviewer's request, we now provide a shorter image exposure time for the ABC antibody that is now matched with the pan &#x003b2;-catenin antibody exposure (Compare Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> with A&#x00026;B) to show that it is indeed difficult to distinguish true ABC "signal" to background "noise" in the HEK cell system.</p></sec><sec><title>Review#3 response</title><p>At first, I thought that longer exposure might be the cause of nuclear signals appeared in HEK 293 cells without LiCl stimulation, because ABC signals appeared in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> seemed saturated in comparison with that in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. So I have requested the authors to show the images exposed shorter time in addition to western blot analysis. Some images of ABC staining without stimulation showed reduced signals than that with stimulation, as expected (not shown). However, other images actually showed strong nuclear staining without stimulation as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>. So I understood the existence of strong nuclear signals, which were not ABC, in HEK293 cells using 8E7 antibody.</p><p>Furthermore, their data contain more information, which is not addressed so much in the text. Activation of Wnt signal can be estimated by total &#x003b2;-catenin staining in Wnt3a-expressing L cells, but not ABC, because of the weak induction of dephosphorylated &#x003b2;-catenin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, 3B</xref>). Thus, Wnt activity cannot be estimated in certain cell types using 8E7 antibody. This is an example of the limitation using 8E7 antibody for estimating the Wnt activity. As expected, low signal and high noise is the problematic situation when estimating the genuine signals. As described here, the authors have successfully shown the difficulty using this antibody. One way to look at this finding is that slight induction of ABC is actually exhibited the exact Wnt activity in L cells. But there is another side to this finding. This data may further indicate the existence of unknown regulatory mechanisms of &#x003b2;-catenin stabilization in Wnt-signaling other than inhibition of phosphorylation. Obviously, monoclonal antibody, 8E7 is an important tool for research in the field of Wnt. To understand the relation between biological significance of the weak Wnt activity and ABC signals is one of the important issues to be clarified.</p><p>For these reasons, I think that this manuscript is a reasonable paper for publication in Biology Direct.</p></sec><sec><title>Our response</title><p>We agree with Dr. Sugai's suggestion that the Abstract and Conclusions of our manuscript could be written more clearly, so as to explain our findings more succinctly and directly. The following additions have now been incorporated:</p><sec><title>Abstract</title><p>"In cell types commonly used to study Wnt activation, this non-specific nuclear staining can be robust, obscuring the ABC signal.
