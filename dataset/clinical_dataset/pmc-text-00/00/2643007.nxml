Nor, to date, have there been any studies of MHC in wild amphibian host-pathogen systems. We characterise an MHC class I locus in the common frog, and present primers to amplify both the whole region, and specifically the antigen binding region. As no more than two expressed haplotypes were found in over 400 clones from 66 individuals, it is likely that there is a single class I locus in this species. This finding is consistent with the single class I locus in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, but contrasts with the multiple loci identified in axolotls, providing evidence that the diversification of MHC class I into multiple loci likely occurred after the Caudata/Anura divergence (approximately 350 million years ago) but before the Ranidae/Pipidae divergence (approximately 230 mya). We use this locus to compare wild populations of common frogs that have been infected with a viral pathogen (<italic>Ranavirus</italic>) with those that have no history of infection. We demonstrate that certain MHC supertypes are associated with infection status (even after accounting for shared ancestry), and that the diseased populations have more similar supertype frequencies (lower F<sub>ST</sub>) than the uninfected. These patterns were not seen in a suite of putatively neutral microsatellite loci. We interpret this pattern at the MHC locus to indicate that the disease has imposed selection for particular haplotypes, and hence that common frogs may be adapting to the presence of <italic>Ranavirus</italic>, which currently kills tens of thousands of amphibians in the UK each year.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many studies searching for the genetic consequences of natural selection have focused their attention on the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Conseguera1">&#x0005b;e.g. 1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Froeschke1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Seddon1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The MHC is a group of genes known to be directly involved in the immune response in vertebrates, and variation at the MHC has been linked to disease resistance and susceptibility (e.g. contrasting allelic frequencies in resistant and susceptible chickens with Marek's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Briles1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>). In most vertebrates the MHC comprises several loci which fall into three subgroups, class I, II and III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Hughes1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Proteins encoded by the MHC class I and II loci form complexes with antigenic peptides and present these at the cell surface to the T-cell antigen receptors. The class III region encompasses many genes and although some are involved in immunity, they are not directly involved in the presentation of antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Campbell1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. MHC class I is primarily involved in presenting endogenously synthesised antigens such as viral proteins, whereas MHC class II is mainly involved in presenting exogenous antigens such as bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Bernatchez1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. However, professional antigen presenting cells (e.g. dendritic cells) can load exogenous antigens onto both class I and II molecules, and autophagy can deliver endogenous antigens to the class II pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Vyas1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The class I gene family is divided into the classical class Ia genes and the non-classical class Ib genes. Class Ia genes are very polymorphic, with most of the polymorphism occurring within the Peptide Binding Region (PBR) which is the area that recognizes antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Flajnik1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Class Ib genes have limited or no polymorphism and their function remains largely unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Flajnik1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Ohtsuka1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Expressed MHC loci typically show very high levels of diversity, which correspond to allelic polymorphisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Piertney1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. High diversity in MHC loci could have a straightforward benefit, by allowing the identification of a larger number of antigens, and so enabling the organism to cope with a greater range of pathogens. It has therefore been proposed that the high diversity at the MHC is maintained by balancing selection, caused by coevolution between hosts and pathogens. One possible form of balancing selection is overdominance (heterozygote advantage), whereby heterozygotes are at an advantage as they can present a broader range of antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Doherty1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. An alternative form is negative frequency-dependent selection, whereby individuals with a novel rare allele have a selective advantage, since pathogens have not evolved to escape their surveillance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Bodmer1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Clarke1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Although overdominance and negative-frequency dependent selection are the most frequently proposed modes of selection at the MHC, there are other possibilities. For example, there is evidence for fluctuating selection in TAP genes (Transporter associated with Antigen Processing) in Danish brown trout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Jensen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Fluctuating selection occurs when a heterogeneous environment causes selection for different alleles over time and/or space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Hedrick1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Fluctuating selection could occur if a pathogen is fast evolving, or if different strains occur in different populations. Directional selection can also occur at the MHC, in which case the spread of an advantageous allele (positive selection) would be expected to lead to a loss of genetic variation. Similarly, selection against disadvantageous alleles (negative or purifying selection) would also be expected to reduce diversity. Directional selection may explain why the two human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types associated with protection from malaria are common in West Africans but rare in other racial groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Hill1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Directional selection appears most likely when a single pathogen imposes a substantial proportion of the selection on a particular host species.</p><p>In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> there is a single class I locus of the class Ia type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Ohta1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Shum1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, and there is evidence that this locus is involved in susceptibility to viral infection (<italic>Ranavirus</italic>, family: Iridoviridae) in amphibians.

The Caudata (including axolotls) are thought to have diverged from Anura (including <italic>Rana</italic> and <italic>Xenopus</italic> sp.) over 350 million years ago, whilst Ranidae (<italic>Rana</italic> sp.) and Pipidae (<italic>Xenopus</italic> sp.) diverged approximately 230mya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Roelants1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our evidence comes from a natural experiment in the field, in which some ponds have been exposed to repeated infection for over a decade, whereas others have escaped disease over the same period. We have shown that certain MHC class I supertypes differ in frequency between infected and uninfected wild populations of common frogs, implying directional selection against the alleles conferring greater susceptibility. This finding indicates that the frogs are adapting to the presence of <italic>Ranavirus</italic> in the wild.

However, it has previously been shown that there was no comparable reduction in allelic diversity at microsatellite loci in infected populations, comparing these and also 11 further Rv&#x0002b; and 9 further Rv&#x02212; populations (Teacher 2009, <italic>PhD thesis</italic>, <italic>University of London</italic>). Hence the reduction in MHC richness appears better explained as another effect of directional selection, which could also produce more uniform allele frequencies (the reduced F<sub>ST</sub> among the Rv&#x0002b; populations) if the different infected ponds retained similar resistant genotypes. This finding implies that <italic>Ranavirus</italic> imposes selection for similar genotypes across the geographical range studied.</p><p>Microsatellite loci RtSB3 and RtSB14 also showed a higher F<sub>ST</sub> than expected, although only RtSB3 showed a significant difference between Rv&#x0002b; and Rv&#x02212; ponds under the more stringent randomization test.

It would be interesting to identify candidate genes by chromosome walking or genome mapping.</p><p>The microsatellite studies had provided evidence for positive assortative mating in Rv&#x0002b; populations: elevated homozogosity indicated an excess of mating between related individuals. There is therefore an intriguing possibility that assortative mating for resistant MHC haplotypes may be taking place.

Once <italic>Rana temporaria</italic> sequences were obtained from these primers, a species-specific reverse primer (RpipR2 <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-<sc>tgaaacccgtacaccagaca</sc>-3&#x02032;</named-content>) was designed to be used with Rpip9F to amplify only the antigen binding region (exons 2 and 3 corresponding to the &#x000e1;1 &#x00026; &#x000e1;2 domains, approximately 650 bp). The 650 base-pair region was amplified from cDNA using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with primers Rpip9F and RpipR2. The reagents were: 16 &#x000b5;l Taq PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, UK), 4 &#x000b5;l cDNA, 200 pmol of each primer (2 &#x000b5;l), and 16 &#x000b5;l RNAse-free water. The samples were denatured at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes followed by 25 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min 30 sec, and 71&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes, followed by a final elongation step of 71&#x000b0;C for 10 min to complete fragment extension. The PCR products were run on 1.2&#x00025; agarose gels with 5 &#x000b5;l loading buffer and a 100 base-pair ladder (Microzone Ltd, UK). The 650 base pair bands were cut from the gels and DNA extracted using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, UK). One sample of gDNA was run with each cDNA PCR plate; gDNA samples yield a 950 base pair band which is not seen in cDNA amplifications, thus confirming that cDNA samples were not contaminated with gDNA.</p><p>Ligation and transformation of amplified cDNA products were performed the same day using the Qiagen PCR Cloning Plus Kit (Qiagen, UK). For each individual, 75 &#x000b5;l of transformed cells were spread onto an LB agar plate containing ampicillin, IPTG and X-gal according to the cloning kit instructions. Plates were incubated overnight at 37&#x000b0;C. Six clonal sequences were required per individual to reduce the chances of missing one allele from a heterozygote to below p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.05. Seven colonies were picked per individual as colonies did not always contain the insert. The colonies were grown overnight at 37&#x000b0;C, shaking at 225 rpm, in individual falcon tubes containing 600 &#x000b5;l LB broth with 30 &#x000b5;g ampicillin. Plasmid purifications were then prepared from the colonies using the Zyppy Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, USA). Purified plasmid DNA (30&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;g/ml) was used for sequencing with standard M13 primers by Cogenics (Essex, UK).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Analysis</title><p>Alleles were confirmed when at least two clones showed identical sequences. Homozygotes were confirmed on the basis of at least 6 identical sequences; when 6 clones are picked, there is a probability of 0.5<sup>5</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.03125 that there is a second allele which has not been picked by chance. Every confirmed allele was recorded in the data set. Nucleotide sequences (GenBank accession numbers FJ385575&#x02013;FJ385703) were aligned using Sequencher v.4. (Gene Codes Corporation), and confirmed as belonging to the MHC Class I conserved domain using BLAST searches (National Center for Biotechnology Information). We used the antigen binding region (comprising of the &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2 domains) for all analyses; this region which was identified by amino acid alignment with Xenopus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Flajnik3">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and Atlantic salmon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Conseguera1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> sequences.</p><p>Observed heterozygosity was calculated within Rv&#x0002b; and Rv&#x02212; groups by dividing the number of observed heterozygotes by the total number of individuals with both alleles typed.

The allelic richness was characterized by the mean number of substitutions per base as calculated by MEGA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Kumar1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, and compared between Rv&#x0002b; and Rv&#x02212; groups using a two-tailed t-test. Modeltest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Posada1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> was used to test 56 possible DNA substitution model parameters, and identify the best fit model for the data. A neighbour-joining tree was produced using the Tamura-Nei model of nucleotide substitution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Tamura1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, with 100 bootstrap replicates. MHC supertypes were identified on the basis of branch length; clusters of individuals (n&#x0003e;1) which were separated from other individuals by a branch length of &#x02264;0.007 (an arbitrarily chosen value, after visual inspection of data) were categorized as a unique supertype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004616-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). A Chi-squared test was used to compare MHC supertype frequencies between Rv&#x0002b; and Rv&#x02212; populations; however the individuals within each category are not strictly independent, as inhabitants of the same pond are likely to share common ancestry. To overcome this issue, we constructed a randomization test (performed in R v.2.4.0). The Chi-squared test was repeated (for 10,000 iterations) after reallocating disease status at random to ponds; the source code is included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004616.s001">Supporting Information S1</xref>. The Chi-squared value from the real data was then compared with the randomized distribution to establish the significance level. For comparison, this method was then repeated with data from 14 putatively neutral microsatellite loci (Teacher 2009, <italic>PhD thesis</italic>, <italic>University of London</italic>), using data for the same populations as used for the MHC analyses (Rv&#x0002b;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;77 individuals, mean per population&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;11; Rv&#x02212;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;61 individuals, mean per population&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9) to investigate whether the Rv&#x0002b; and Rv&#x02212; populations were, by chance, more genetically distinct than average. We used FDist2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Beaumont1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> implemented in Lositan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004616-Antao1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> to further assess the effect of any selection on the variation between populations at the MHC or microsatellite loci. The program compares the F<sub>ST</sub> of marker loci with simulated expected values (conditional on their heterozygosity), and identifies outliers. This method was applied to Rv&#x0002b; and Rv&#x02212; populations individually and combined, using data at the MHC locus, together with data for the same populations from the 14 microsatellite loci to provide information on neutral expectations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004616.s001"><label>Supporting Information S1</label><caption><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004616.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Many thanks to the pond owners for allowing access to their frog populations, and to Froglife (registered charity no. 1093372) for sharing records of amphibian mortalities.
