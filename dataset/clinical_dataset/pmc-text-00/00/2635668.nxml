In eastern China, the continuous use of benzimidazole fungicides has caused the appearance of fungicide resistant strains in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and these resistant populations are becoming dominant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-9-3-371">3</xref>]. Lacking effective resistant cultures, plant disease control in China nowadays still relies mainly on the application of chemical agents. With the application of the PRC Agricultural Product Quality Security law, research and development of novel fungicides with high safety and efficiency has become a hot topic of crop protection research.</p><p>Osthol (7-methoxy-8-[3-methylpent-2-enyl] coumarin), a plant coumarin, is isolated from the dried fruits of <italic>Cnidium Monnieri</italic> which have been used as a herbal medicine since ancient times in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-9-3-371">4</xref>].

Our previous studies also showed that osthol has a wide antifungal activity, with the EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 21.15 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to 61.62 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> against <italic>Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum mllsae, Fusarium graminearum, Phytophora capsici, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic> and other phytopathogenic fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-3-371">10</xref>]. So, as a natural plant toxin, osthol has been developed into biopesticides in our lab, however, its antifungal mechanism and mode of action against phytopathogens still remains unknown.

Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>2.1 Results</title><sec><title>2.1.1 Effects of osthol on hyphal growth</title><p><italic>In vitro</italic> antifungal assays in our previous study had demonstrated that osthol could inhibit the growth of hyphae of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> with its EC<sub>50</sub> value 56.94 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-3-371">10</xref>]. Here, the results of disc diffusion test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 1</xref>) and biomass assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 2</xref>) further confirmed its inhibitory effects on hyphal growth of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. With the increase of osthol concentration in PDA medium plates, the inhibitory effect against <italic>F. graminearum</italic> was enhanced through reducing the growth diameter on plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 2</xref>, osthol began to affect the hyphal growth when its concentration beyond 25 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. And the dry weight of hyphae almost behalved when osthol was used at 100 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. We did not find hyphal fragment on osthol-treated PDA medium plates. But through microscope observation, we found that more branches appeared from the top edge of hypha treated with osthol (date not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>2.2.2 Effects of osthol on hyphae morphology</title><p>After treatment with 100 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> osthol for 24 hours, the hyphae of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> broke into large fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 3B</xref>). But these fragments remained actively which could be proved by the result of fragments reinoculation test shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 3C</xref>. Furthermore, the TEM observation showed that the osthol-treated hyphae presented degenerative changes compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 4</xref>). There are large vesicles appearing in osthol-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 4C</xref>, E) and most of these cell walls were becoming blurring after 24h treatment with 100 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> osthol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition, nuclei in cells of blank and solvent controls can be clearly distinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 4A, B</xref>), however, this was changed in osthol-treated cells. We could not found visible boundary of nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>2.2.3 Effects of osthol on hyphal glucose absorption</title><p>An effect of osthol on hyphal glucose utilization was detected. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 5</xref>, within the osthol-treated hyphae reducing sugar levels decreased to the lowest value after 3 h and recovered to the control level 6 h after the treatment. By thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, we found that the reducing sugar in hyphae of <italic>F</italic>. graminearum was mainly composed of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, <sup>14</sup>C-labelled glucose was used to investigate the glucose absorption of hyphae. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 7</xref> suggests that there is an inhibitory effect of osthol on glucose absorption by hyphae at the beginning stages of the treatment. After longer exposure periods the content of <sup>14</sup>C-labelled glucose in osthol-treated hyphae increased very slowly, while in the control samples the soluble <sup>14</sup>C remained at the high beginning level of the experiment indicating the effective absorption of glucose by the hyphae. The decrease of the hyphal soluble <sup>14</sup>C in control appeared earlier than in the osthol treated samples. These results not only showed a comparatively slow <sup>14</sup>C-labelled glucose accumulation in osthol-treated hyphae but also indicated that the transformation rate of <sup>14</sup>C switching from soluble form to insoluble form was slower than the control.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2.4 Influence of osthol on cell wall synthesis-related components</title><p>Morphology observations showed that osthol could cause hyphal cell wall loosening and hyphae breakage. Thereby, components and synthesis-related enzymes of cell wall were examined after hypae were treated with osthol. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijms-9-3-371">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijms-9-3-371">9</xref> show that after treatment with 100 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> osthol, chitinase activity and <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-D-glucosamine in osthol-treated hyphae were both higher than in that of the controls. Especially, chitinase activity in osthol-treated hyphae reached the highest level at 3h after the beginning of the treatment. However, &#x003b2;-1,6-glucanase activity showed no obvious difference compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 10</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>2.2 Discussion</title><p>Osthol displayed a broad-spectrum antifungal activity against phytopathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-3-371">10</xref>]. Bioassay demonstrated that osthol showed a high activity against <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-3-371">Figures 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-3-371">3</xref>) and the <italic>in vitro</italic> assays in this study also indicated that osthol could inhibit hyphal growth of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Treated with 100 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>osthol for 24 h, the hyphae of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> growing in aqueous culture broke into fragments and the fragments could develop to colonies after inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 3C</xref>). This indicated that the treatment inhibited the growth of the fungi, but was not lethal to them.</p><p>The morphological observations showed cytoplasmic vacuolation and blurring of organelles and cell walls after the treatment with osthol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 4</xref>). The fungal cell wall consists basically of a complex network of glucan and chitin, playing important roles in several biological processes such as cell shape, morphogenesis, reproduction, cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction, and osmotic, physical protection.</p><p>The fungal cell wall is critical for cell viability and pathogenicity. Chitin and &#x003b2;-1,6-glucanase in the cell wall of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> both confer a high mechanical resistance to the cell wall. In previous study, Chaffin and Lopez-Ribot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-9-3-371">11</xref>] found that chitin was important although only a low content (0.6%&#x02013;9%) could be found in the wall of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (mainly in the septum of the hyphae). When the fragments appeared after treated with osthol, the components of cell wall of hyphae and hydrolysis-relative enzymes were measured. The results showed that the chitinase activity increased after the treatment with osthol compared with the control and that <italic>N</italic>-Glc<italic>N</italic>Ac, the chitin unit, remained to a high content in the hyphae. However, &#x003b2;-1,6-glucanase activity did not obviously change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijms-9-3-371">9</xref>), which indicated that osthol treatment could not activate the up-regulated expression of glucanase genes in hyphae of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. So glucan, the important component within cell wall, was not hydrolyzed due to the stabilization of glucanolytic activities. In agreement with this, the results of the TEM experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 4</xref>) showed clearly that the blurring of cell wall after treated with osthol was mainly caused by the hydrolyzation of chitin in the wall. Hence, the broken hyphae appeared due to the loosing of cell wall together with the water flow pressure in liquid medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>As a necessary component of cell wall, chitin could be hydrolyzed when sugar starvation occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-3-371">12</xref>]. A previous report had demonstrated that the coumarin compounds could inhibit the glucose absorption by N. <italic>frontalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-3-371">13</xref>]. In the present study, decreasing glucose content led to changes to V-shaped form in osthol-treated hyphae of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> suggesting a starvation and a recovery of nutrient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 5</xref>). From assay of morphology observation, the large vesicles in osthol-treated hyphae indicated that the treatment of osthol might originate glucose starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-3-371">14</xref>]. The origin of the starvation might be the inability of nutrient absorption caused by osthol. The results of the trial about <sup>14</sup>C-labeled glucose absorption agree with this conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 7</xref>). When cells of fungi encounter stress or unfavorable nutrient conditions, the changes of cell were physiologically and morphologically different from the cells growing exponentially. Especially sugar starvation initiates changes in substantial physiological and biochemical processes with the goal of sustaining respiration and other essential metabolic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-9-3-371">15</xref>].</p><p>The results also showed that plenty of vacuoles appeared in the osthol-treated hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-3-371">Figure 4</xref>). Autophagy was the major route which cells require enhanced structural compounds degradation and remodeling of components for the maintenance of viability of fungi under starvation conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-9-3-371">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-9-3-371">17</xref>].</p><p>Although basic activity of osthol against the phytopathogen and some changes of physiological activity were reported herein, further detailed research should be focused on direct targets in the phytopathogenic cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>3.
