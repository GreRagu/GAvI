Cervical biopsies were taken from 60 women: 18 at preterm labor, 7 at preterm not in labor, 18 at term labor and 17 at term not in labor. ELISA and Immulite were used for protein and real-time RT&#x02013;PCR for mRNA analysis. Cervical fibroblast cultures were incubated for 18 h with different CRH concentrations (10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M). The mRNA expression of MMP-1, -3 and -9 was higher in laboring groups compared with term not in labor. Protein levels of MMP-8 and -9 were higher in term in labor group compared with non-laboring groups. There were no significant differences in mRNA and protein expression between the preterm and respective term control groups. CRH significantly increased secretion of IL-8 in preterm and term cervical fibroblasts compared with controls. The secretion of IL-8 and MMP-1 was significantly higher and MMP-3 secretion lower in preterm cervical fibroblasts. In conclusion, cervical ripening at preterm seems to be a similar inflammatory process as at term with CRH involved. However, preterm and term cervical fibroblasts might have different phenotypes based on different secretion patterns of IL-8, MMP-1 and MMP-3.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>cervical ripening</kwd><kwd>cytokines</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>matrix metalloproteinases</kwd><kwd>preterm birth</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C28">Saigal and Doyle, 2008</xref>). Despite the several strategies for treatment, the frequency of PTB has not changed significantly during the past three decades and the mechanisms underlying the initiation of both preterm and term labor remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C3">Challis <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C8">Hertelendy and Zakar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C12">Iams <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Uterine contractions must be coordinated with a softening of the cervix for a successful delivery. Cervical softening involves intensive remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), with extensive changes in concentration and composition of collagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C39">Uldbjerg <italic>et al</italic>., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C5">Ekman <italic>et al</italic>., 1986</xref>) and proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C24">Norman <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C43">Westergren-Thorsson <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). Cytokines and several other mediators, including estrogen, progesterone, prostaglandins and nitric oxide, participate in the remodeling of ECM and ripening of the human cervix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C33">Stjernholm <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C1">Abelin Tornblom <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C8">Hertelendy and Zakar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C37">Tornblom <italic>et al</italic>., 2005b</xref>). This process can be regarded as an inflammatory reaction associated with elevated levels of cytokines at the time of both preterm and time labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C31">Sennstrom <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C36">Tornblom <italic>et al</italic>., 2005a</xref>). Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 increase at least 100-fold at term labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C31">Sennstrom <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). IL-8 promotes recruitment and activation of neutrophils, which in turn secrete proteolytic enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and MMP-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C26">Osmers <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C34">Stygar <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). The MMPs play a central role in the degradation of ECM components. The levels of MMPs in the cervix, lower uterine segment, amniotic fluid, fetal membranes and maternal plasma increase at labor time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C38">Tu <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C44">Winkler <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C34">Stygar <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C32">Sennstrom <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C42">Weiss <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Polymorphism in MMP-1 and MMP-9 genes has been shown to be associated with preterm premature rupture of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C6">Ferrand <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C7">Fujimoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is the principal regulator of the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis has been of interest in connection with labor since Liggins induced premature parturition in sheep with corticotropin and cortisol infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C20">Liggins, 1968</xref>). CRH is produced by fetomaternal tissues and secreted into the maternal circulation, so that during pregnancy the maternal plasma levels of this hormone increase, while the corresponding binding protein (CRH-BP) levels are reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C21">Linton <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C9">Hillhouse and Grammatopoulos, 2002</xref>). Patients at risk for PTB have significantly elevated plasma levels of CRH and lower CRH-BP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C10">Hobel <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>).</p><p>CRH, CRH-BP and the receptors for CRH, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 are expressed in human placenta, deciduas, fetal membranes, endometrium and myometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C16">Kalantaridou <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, CRH increases MMP-9 protein secretion by cultured cells from placenta and fetal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C19">Li and Challis, 2005</xref>). In our previous study we have localized CRH, CRH-BP, CRH-R1 and CRH-R2 in the cervix, which suggested that the cervix may be a target for CRH action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C17">Klimaviciute <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Therefore, our present aim was to determine if CRH has an effect on the secretion of IL-8, MMP-1 and MMP-3 in both preterm and term cervical fibroblasts. Furthermore, our aim was to compare the levels of mRNA and protein expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-8 and MMP-9 in human cervical tissue in preterm and term labor as well as not in labor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 51 women were included in the study for the analysis of MMP expression. Two preterm groups consisted of 14 women undergoing preterm labor (PTL) and 7 women delivered preterm by Caesarean section prior to the onset of labor (PTnotL). Preterm delivery was defined as delivery before the 37th week of gestation. Two control term groups included 13 women undergoing normal term labor (TL) and 17 women at term not in labor delivered by elective Caesarean section (TnotL). The labor groups (PTL and TL) were in active labor and demonstrated a ripe cervix, with dilatation more than 4 cm. They were either delivered vaginally or by emergency Caesarean section due to malpresentation (at preterm and at term) or due to threatening fetal asphyxia (at term). In all patients delivered by Caesarean section, the assessment of cervical dilatation was established immediately before surgery. Women not in labor (PTnotL and TnotL) had unripe cervices (with a Bishop score of &#x0003c;5 points) and were delivered by Caesarean section prior to the onset of labor. The preterm indications were suspected placental abruption or intrauterine growth retardation and the term indications were breech presentation, humanitarian or disproportion.</p><p>Cervical biopsies from an additional nine women (four PTL and five TL) were used for the cultures of cervical fibroblasts.</p><p>None of the women included in the study suffered from pre-eclampsia, diabetes or other systemic disease, nor did any of our subjects demonstrate clinical signs of infection in connection with parturition or during the post-partal period.</p><p>There were no significant differences between these groups of women with respect to maternal age, parity, previous PTBs and Caesarean sections.

The biopsies were rinsed in Earle's Minimal Essential Medium (EMEM), cut into pieces of &#x0223c;1 mm<sup>3</sup>, and allowed to adhere to the bottom of the culture chamber at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, for 4 h before addition of EMEM with penicillin (1%), streptomycin (1%), glutamine (1%) and donor calf serum (10%). Explants were incubated for 2&#x02013;3 weeks until confluent fibroblast cultures were obtained. Sub-cultures of cells were done by trypsinization according to standard procedures giving rise to two separate but identical preparations for further experiments. All experiments were done with cells in passages between 3 and 5.</p><p>Phenotype of the fibroblasts was identified morphologically and employing three fibroblast markers: vimentin (sc53464, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-fibroblast surface protein antibody 1B10 (F4771, Sigma, St Louis, Missouri, USA) and prolyl-4-hydroxylase beta (AF0910-1, Acris Antibodies GmbH, Hiddenhausen, Germany). The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and unspecific binding was blocked with a 2% solution of bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with the primary antibodies (1:100 in blocking buffer) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated or Alexa Flour 594-conjugated antibodies, raised in goat and directed against immunoglobulins of the species used to raise the primary antibody, were used for detection of the bound primary antibodies (1:200, 1 h). Between each step the cells were carefully rinsed with PBS. A light-scanning microscope was used to examine the cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Stimulation experiments</title><p>Cervical fibroblasts were seeded on 12-well cell culture plates and grown until confluence, usually after 3 days.

All concentrations were performed in duplicate. Media samples were collected and frozen until analysis. MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9 were quantified using ELISA as described earlier.

This finding together with our earlier studies on CRH and cytokines in preterm cervix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C37">Tornblom <italic>et al</italic>., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C17">Klimaviciute <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) indicates that preterm cervical ripening is the same inflammatory process as the cervical ripening at term.</p><p>In this study, we also analyzed the effect of CRH on the secretion of MMPs and IL-8 in the cervical fibroblasts. To our knowledge, this is the first such kind of study on the preterm and term cervical fibroblasts. We have shown that CRH increased the secretion of IL-8 in both preterm and term cervical fibroblasts, but did not affect the secretion of MMP-1 and MMP-3. MMP-9 was not detected in the culture medium, which confirms the earlier studies that MMP-9 is not produced by cervical fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C18">Ledingham <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C34">Stygar <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). IL-8 is an important mediator of cervical ripening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C26">Osmers <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C30">Sennstrom <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). The fact that CRH and its receptors are localized in the cervix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C17">Klimaviciute <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) and that it has an effect on IL-8 secretion from cervical fibroblasts points towards the possible role of CRH in the process of the cervical ripening. Several studies have shown that CRH can stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines in different cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C2">Angioni <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C45">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C41">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), although some studies present contradicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C2">Angioni <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C29">Sehringer <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). The possible mechanism by which CRH induces IL-8 production in the cervical fibroblasts could be a selective activation of the p38/MAPK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C41">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). However, CRH could be involved in several different signaling pathways, like reactive oxygen intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C45">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) or the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C47">Zhao and Karalis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C46">Zbytek <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The results on the secretion of MMP-1 and MMP-3 from cervical fibroblasts contradict the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C19">Li and Challis (2005</xref>). Li and Challis showed an induced secretion of MMP-9 by CRH in the cell cultures from human placenta and fetal membranes. The explanation for this contradiction could be that the cell cultures were established from different tissues. Furthermore, different MMPs were analyzed. However, cytokines are known to stimulate the production of MMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C15">Ito <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C13">Imada <italic>et al</italic>., 1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C14">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C25">Oner <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), so it would be logical to expect an elevation of MMP-1 and MMP-3 levels when there is an increased secretion of IL-8. One possible explanation could be that even if the levels of IL-8 increase under the action of CRH, the concentration might still be too low to induce secretion of MMPs. Another explanation may be that IL-8 can induce the activity of MMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C35">Thirumangalakudi <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) with no effect on the total concentration of MMPs.</p><p>One interesting finding of this study is that preterm and term cervical fibroblasts show different secretion patterns of IL-8, MMP-1 and MMP-3, where IL-8 and MMP-1 are secreted at higher levels in preterm and MMP-3 in term cervical fibroblasts. In our unpublished study, we were able to show the differences in proteoglycan production in preterm and term cervical fibroblasts. These findings indicate that cervical fibroblasts at preterm and term vaginal delivery may have different phenotypes. However, in our studies, we were not able to show any differences in the concentrations of cytokines or MMPs in the preterm cervical tissue compared with term. One explanation for this could be that we have many different cells producing MMPs and IL-8 in the cervical tissue, like leukocytes, cervical smooth muscle cells and macrophages. The clinical significance of different secretion patterns of IL-8, MMP-1 and MMP3 in preterm and term cervical fibroblasts still needs to be elucidated.</p><p>A notable observation is that MMP-1 was higher in preterm cervical fibroblasts, whereas MMP-3 was higher at term. MMP-1 and MMP-3 have different substrates in the tissue: MMP-1 breaks down fibrillar and non-fibrillar collagens, whereas MMP-3 cleaves proteoglycans, fibronectine, gelatins, collagen IV and V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C11">Hulboy <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). Earlier studies have shown some differences between MMP-1 and MMP-3 in amniotic fluid. MMP-1, but not MMP-3, concentrations increase in amniotic fluid with advancing gestational age. Spontaneous parturition at term and preterm is associated with significant increase in amniotic fluid concentrations of MMP-3, but not MMP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C23">Maymon <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C27">Park <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The main strength of this study is that human material was used. We have well-defined patient groups both in labor and not in labor at preterm and at term. Cervical biopsies are extremely hard to obtain especially in relation to preterm delivery, which is the reason why so few studies are conducted on the human preterm cervix. Our group has applied this sampling procedure for almost 30 years to obtain cervical tissue samples including squamous and cylindrical epithelium, vessels, glands and ECM. The study also includes both analysis in the cervical tissue and experiments on the cervical fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>A weakness of the study could be the relatively small size of the groups investigated. This could be explained by the invasive sampling procedure, which is extremely hard to coordinate with delivery and renders it difficult to get a large number of samples. Nevertheless, important differences between the groups are still possible to detect as we have seen in our earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C30">Sennstrom <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C32">2003</xref>). Secondly, the use of different passages of cervical fibroblasts could be seen as disadvantage. However, we have seen a stable phenotype until passage 8 in our earlier studies of cervical fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C22">Malmstrom <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). In this study, we have determined the levels of total MMPs. It is possible that the results could have been different if we had examined the active forms of MMPs. Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, for instance, induces activation of MMP-3, but does not affect MMP-3 total protein in the rat cervix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C4">Chien <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). However, proteolytic activity of MMP-1 and MMP-3 follows the same pattern as total protein levels in human decidual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C25">Oner <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). We have chosen to perform analysis of the total MMPs, as it was not possible to perform analysis of both total and active forms in this study because of the shortage of material. Moreover, the lower levels of active MMPs could be undetectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="GAN060C19">Li and Challis, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the current study shows that spontaneous parturition at preterm and at term is associated with elevated mRNA and protein levels of MMPs in the cervical tissue. However, different secretion patterns of IL-8, MMP-1 and MMP-3 in preterm and term cervical fibroblasts indicate that they might have different phenotypes. Furthermore, CRH stimulates the secretion of IL-8 both in preterm and term cervical fibroblasts, which suggests that CRH could be involved in the process of cervical ripening. Further studies are still needed to elucidate the significance of these findings.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p><grant-sponsor>Swedish Research Council</grant-sponsor>
