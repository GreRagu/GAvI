Extreme differences in maternal mortality rates between developed and developing countries indicate that most of these deaths are preventable. Most information on the causes of maternal death in these areas is based on clinical records and verbal autopsies. Clinical diagnostic errors may play a significant role in this problem and might also have major implications for the evaluation of current estimations of causes of maternal death.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>A retrospective analysis of clinico-pathologic correlation was carried out, using necropsy as the gold standard for diagnosis. All maternal autopsies (<italic>n &#x0003d;</italic> 139) during the period from October 2002 to December 2004 at the Maputo Central Hospital, Mozambique were included and major diagnostic discrepancies were analyzed (i.e., those involving the cause of death). Major diagnostic errors were detected in 56 (40.3&#x00025;) maternal deaths. A high rate of false negative diagnoses was observed for infectious diseases, which showed sensitivities under 50&#x00025;: HIV/AIDS-related conditions (33.3&#x00025;), pyogenic bronchopneumonia (35.3&#x00025;), pyogenic meningitis (40.0&#x00025;), and puerperal septicemia (50.0&#x00025;).

The number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in this region is nearly 1,000, whereas in developed regions it is only nine deaths. A 15-year-old girl living in sub-Saharan Africa has a lifetime risk of dying during pregnancy or childbirth of 1 in 22, but a girl living in the developed regions of the world has a lifetime risk of only 1 in 7,300. Maternal deaths can be caused by obstetric (childbirth-related) complications such as puerperal septicemia (an infection of the blood contracted during delivery) and eclampsia (seizures associated with high blood pressure during pregnancy), and by nonobstetric conditions such as HIV/AIDS-related infections and other infections.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>In 2000, the United Nations made reduction of the global burden of maternal mortality one of its Millennium Development Goals (a set of targets designed to eradicate poverty by 2015), but little progress has been made toward achieving this goal. One possible explanation for this failure might be that limited access to diagnostic tests in developing countries results in more clinical diagnostic errors than in developed countries and that, consequently, mothers in developing countries don't always get the right treatment when they become ill. Unfortunately, it is difficult to test this hypothesis, because there is very little accurate information on the causes of maternal death in many developing countries. What information there is comes mainly from clinical records and verbal autopsies (asking relatives about the mother's death) rather than from examination of the body after death (a medical autopsy), the only sure way to ascertain the cause of death. In this study, the researchers retrospectively analyze discrepancies between the clinical diagnoses and autopsy diagnoses of 139 mothers who died at the Maputo Central Hospital, Mozambique, a large hospital providing specialized care for women with high-risk pregnancies.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>All the organs from the mothers were visually examined by a pathologist and samples of any abnormal tissues and of the internal organs were examined microscopically. Two pathologists independently established the cause of each death by considering both the clinical diagnosis and the autopsy results (the &#x0201c;autopsy diagnosis&#x0201d;). The discrepancies between the clinical and autopsy (&#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d;) diagnoses were then analyzed. Major diagnostic errors (errors involving the cause of death) occurred in nearly half of the maternal deaths; the clinical and autopsy diagnoses completely agreed in only a third of cases. 80&#x00025; of the major diagnostic errors were &#x0201c;class I errors.&#x0201d; That is, errors where a correct diagnosis would have changed patient management and prolonged survival or provided a cure. For example, 12 women were given an incorrect diagnosis of eclampsia when they had other conditions that could have been successfully treated if correctly diagnosed. Furthermore, many infections detected in the autopsies were missed in the clinical diagnoses (false-negative diagnoses), some of which could have been treated.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings show that clinical and autopsy diagnoses of the causes of maternal death frequently disagree in this hospital. Further studies are needed to see whether similar levels of disagreement exist in other hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa. The discrepancy reported here might, for example, be an overestimate of the general situation, because the high-risk pregnancies referred to this hospital might involve more hard-to-diagnose problems than the routine pregnancies referred to other hospitals. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that misdiagnosed conditions may affect maternal mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa and that an increased use of autopsy in the region could reduce maternal mortality by providing more accurate information about why mothers die. In particular, these findings suggest that a more thorough evaluation of cases thought to be eclampsia and a better awareness of the involvement of infectious diseases in maternal deaths might reduce diagnostic errors and consequently reduce the incidence of maternal deaths.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000036">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000036</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>UNICEF (the United Nations Children's Fund) provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.childinfo.org/maternal_mortality_background.html">maternal mortality</ext-link> and the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.childinfo.org/maternal_mortality_countrydata.php">WHO/UNICEF/UNFPA/The World Bank estimates of maternal mortality for 2005 by country</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/maternal_mortality_2005/mme_2005.pdf">WHO/UNICEF/UNFPA/The World Bank estimates of maternal mortality in 2005</ext-link> also provides full information about global maternal mortality</p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK Department for International Development provides information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dfid.gov.uk/mdg/health.asp">Millenium Development Goal 5: the improvement of maternal health</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/pmnch">The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health</ext-link> provides information on maternal deaths (in several languages), including information on the situation in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/pmnch/countries/mozambique/en/index.html">Mozambique</ext-link></p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Ordi J, Ismail MR, Carrilho C, Romagosa C, Osman N, et al.

The study was conducted at the Maputo Central Hospital, a government-funded tertiary health facility that serves as the referral center for other hospitals in Southern Mozambique. All women fulfilling the standard definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) for a pregnancy-related death (i.e., death during pregnancy, delivery, or within 42 d after completion of a pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death) between October 2002 and December 2004, and for whom the family had given verbal informed consent to perform the autopsy, were included in the study. The study protocol was approved by the National Mozambican Ethics Committee and the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona Ethics Review Committee.</p><p>A complete dissection with macroscopic evaluation of each organ was performed by a pathologist using a standardized macroscopic protocol. Samples of all grossly identified lesions and of all viscera were collected in each case for histological study. A blood sample (100 &#x003bc;l) was obtained from the inferior vena cava and stored on filter paper.</p><p>Clinical diagnoses were obtained from those listed by the clinician on the clinical process, after a complete revision of the case notes. The final diagnoses were established by two pathologists after reviewing the clinical process, the macroscopic protocols, and the histological slides. Major diagnoses were those involving the principal underlying cause of death &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

Clinical and necropsy diagnoses were grouped into different categories according to the International Classification of Disease, tenth revision (ICD-10). HIV/AIDS-related diseases included all cases with opportunistic infections or other conditions included in the CDC revised criteria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

Major discrepancies were those involving major diagnoses and were classified as class I or class II discrepancies. In class I, the knowledge of the diagnosis before death, would have led to changes in the management that could have prolonged the survival or cured the patient (e.g., pyogenic meningitis treated as eclampsia), while in class II the survival would have not been modified (e.g., fulminant hepatitis treated as septicemia or terminal AIDS with multiple opportunistic infections treated as a bacterial infection). Minor discrepancies were those involving minor diagnoses and were classified as class III (diseases with symptoms that should have been treated or would have eventually affected the prognosis, e.g., mild aspirative pneumonia in a patient with eclampsia) and class IV (nondiagnosed diseases with possible epidemiological or genetic importance, e.g., schistosomal infections). Correctly diagnosed patients were classified as class V. Class VI were nonclassifiable cases (necropsy unsatisfactory or with no clear diagnosis).</p><p>A single class of major discrepancy (I and II) was assigned to each maternal death. The discrepancies were independently evaluated by two investigators (CR, JO). When minor disagreements were detected (class I versus class II, or class III versus class IV), a consensus meeting was held involving a third investigator (JAB). If a major disagreement was detected (e.g., class I versus class III), a senior pathologist uninvolved in the study was consulted.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Laboratory Methods</title><p>Tissue specimens were fixed in 10&#x00025; buffered formalin for 2&#x02013;15 d and embedded into paraffin wax using standard procedures.

False-negative diagnoses were defined as class I and II discrepancies for which the necropsy diagnosis was in the assessed diagnostic category but the clinical diagnosis was in another. False-positive diagnoses were cases with class I and II discrepancies, in which the clinical diagnosis was in the diagnostic category but not the necropsy diagnosis.

This study has shown a high frequency of major clinico-pathological discrepancies (40.3&#x00025;) in maternal deaths in a tertiary-referral hospital in sub-Saharan Africa. In most cases a change in clinical management could have significantly modified the prognosis. The proportion of discrepancies observed in this study is higher than that currently reported in studies based on nonselected hospital patients &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Remarkably, this study, unlike most previous studies, was based only on maternal deaths. These are extremely infrequent in developed countries &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, and tend to show lower discrepancy rates between clinical and autopsy diagnoses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>A sole description of the correlation between clinical and autopsy diagnosis was done retrospectively in Nigeria including data from 1989 to 1998 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. The prevalence of major diagnostic errors in that study was 10.4&#x00025;, a figure much lower than that reported here. This fact may be explained mainly by methodological differences, since neither histological study nor HIV testing were used in the Nigerian study. Interestingly, in our study only 17.3&#x00025; clinical major discrepancies were detected in the macroscopic study, whereas 57.1&#x00025; of the discrepancies were found only in the histological study, as it has been shown in other studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, PPVs, and NPVs may provide some insight into the possible factors behind major diagnostic errors. A high rate of false negative diagnoses was observed for infectious diseases, both obstetrical (puerperal septicemia) and nonobstetric. Other studies have shown that infectious diseases tend to show higher rates of diagnostic errors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, three frequent nonobstetric infectious categories (HIV/AIDS-related conditions, pyogenic bronchopneumonia, and pyogenic meningitis, as well as tuberculosis) had sensitivities below 40&#x00025;. This number is very relevant since it indicates that significant reductions in maternal mortality could be reached by decreasing the false negative clinical diagnoses of some frequent infectious diseases, through improvements in their diagnosis. Although false negative diagnoses may occur either by omission, or lack of sensitivity of available diagnostic tests or inadequate synthesis in the diagnostic process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, underestimation of prevalence plays an important role in this type of error &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. It has been shown that increasing clinical awareness and the correct estimation of the prevalence of infectious diseases may lead to a reduction in the number of diagnostic errors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Limited access to necessary diagnostic tests and particularly to microbiological cultures in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, represents a major handicap for the diagnosis of many infectious diseases and significantly slows down the provision of drug therapy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Eclampsia was the main source of false positive diagnoses (<italic>n &#x0003d;</italic> 12, 57.1&#x00025;). It cannot be completely excluded that preeclampsia&#x02013;eclampsia was a true diagnosis in some of these patients, and lack of an appropriate management of the condition a contributor to maternal death. However, a different cause of death was found in all these women. Moreover, no pathological lesions related to eclampsia were detected in any of them. False-positive diagnoses may occur due to premature closure of the diagnostic process and low specificity of diagnostic tests, but overestimation of prevalence also plays a major role in this type of error &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Generally, eclampsia is more likely to be diagnosed too frequently rather than overlooked. On the other hand, epilepsy, infections or space-occupying lesions of the central nervous system, cerebrovascular accidents, hypertensive diseases, metabolic disorders, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura may all simulate eclampsia, but they are less frequent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b037">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

The current study suggests that eclampsia remains a significant cause of maternal death in that setting, but its prevalence is probably overestimated.</p><p>The main limitation of our study is that it was conducted in a large university hospital located in the capital of Mozambique, which could limit the extrapolation of these findings to other hospitals and health facilities. It has been shown that the frequency of discrepancies between clinical and autopsy diagnoses is lower in larger hospitals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, and this might suggest that the number of diagnostic errors in other health facilities would be underestimated. On the other hand, complicated or high risk pregnancies are often referred to these larger hospitals resulting in a high number of cases of increased diagnostic difficulty.</p><p>Four necessary conditions have been proposed for necropsy to be a valid monitor of clinical diagnosis performance: a high necropsy rate, specified and stable conditions of autopsy procedure (extent of organ assessment and sampling, availability of clinical information), calculation of sensitivity and specificity rather than accuracy, and estimate of the errors in postmortem diagnosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Our study met three of these conditions, but did not assess the error of autopsy diagnosis itself. The classification into the discrepancy classes was not clear-cut in all cases. A disagreement rate of 13.7&#x00025; in class assignment was detected in our study, a figure that is similar to the disagreement rate reported in other studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. This result could be seen as a limitation of the discrepancy classification.</p><p>The significant reduction of diagnostic errors reported in developed countries during the second half of the 20th century has been mainly attributed to the improvement of clinical skills and to the impact of new diagnostic procedures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Necropsy has had in this regard the dual role of a method to detect diagnostic errors and a source of knowledge to be applied to future cases. This dual role has not only influenced learning but has also added relevant data on local epidemiology of diseases. The scientific, public health, and educational benefits of the autopsy remain difficult to evaluate, but are generally acknowledged &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. The almost complete absence of studies based on necropsy data and focused on diagnostic error is a severe handicap for medical practice in sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, autopsy could help to reduce maternal mortality by providing information critical to improve diagnostic accuracy and therefore clinical management. In this regard, this study suggests that correct awareness of the prevalence of infectious diseases and the implementation of a few inexpensive diagnostic tools and a thorough evaluation of cases clinically thought to be eclampsia may lead to a significant reduction in the number of diagnostic errors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. The implementation of morbidity and mortality conferences may also have an important effect on maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. Additional studies are needed to assess whether analysis of how and when diagnostic errors occur might improve epidemiological data in maternal mortality cases and clinical diagnostic performance.</p><p>In addition to their intrinsic clinical relevance, missed diagnoses detected at autopsy may have important implications for research. The main source of information on the causes of maternal deaths in developing countries is VA, an established method of ascertaining the likely causes of death by interpretation of interviews with relatives or carers of the deceased. VAs are not based on clinical or laboratory measures and have been questioned because they are subject to a relatively high degree of misclassification error &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data indicate that not only VAs but also medical records may contain substantial inaccuracies regarding the main diagnoses causing or contributing to death. It is noteworthy that studies based on these methodologies tend to underreport infectious diseases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000036-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Since diagnoses and causes of death are determined without autopsy in the vast majority of cases, especially in sub-Saharan-Africa, vital statistics, clinical registries, and even randomized trials, may capture incorrect causes of death. These inaccuracies have important policy implications, as major funding and policy decisions are derived in part from vital statistics and other registries of disease burden.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the families of the mothers who were included in the study.
