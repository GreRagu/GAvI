Although multiple body sites such as the axilla and the perineum can be colonized, the most frequent site of carriage is the moist squamous epithelium of the anterior nares. About 20% of the human population carry <italic>S. aureus </italic>permanently in their noses and another 60% of individuals are intermittent carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The reasons for the variable tropism of <italic>S. aureus </italic>for the human nares are unclear. Higher carriage rates occur in white people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], in certain age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and in dialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], diabetic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and AIDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Infection rates are higher in carriers than in non-carriers and invasive disease is often caused by a patients' carried strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However when infected, carriers suffer significantly fewer fatalities, suggesting that carriage stimulates a degree of protective immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>It has been suggested that the ability of <italic>S. aureus </italic>to adhere to human desquamated nasal epithelial cells is an important factor in determining nasal colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

However SasG is not expressed by many strains including Newman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A mutant of <italic>S. aureus </italic>strain Newman defective in IsdA and ClfB had reduced adherence to squamous cells but still bound at about 40% of the level of the wild-type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Since SasG is not expressed by strain Newman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], other cell surface components are likely to be involved. It had been noted that the serine-aspartic acid repeat proteins SdrC and SdrD can also promote adhesion to squamous cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], although this has never been examined in detail. In this paper the role of surface proteins IsdA, ClfB, SdrC and SdrD in adhesion to desquamated cell has been systematically analyzed in order to determine the contribution of each under the same conditions.

Colonization is a known risk factor for the development of staphylococcal infections in the community and hospital. The causes of intermittent and persistent carriage are believed to be different. Persistent carriers are often colonised by a single strain of <italic>S. aureus </italic>over a long period of time, while intermittent carriers tend to carry different strains for briefer time periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Persistent carriers also carry a higher load of bacteria in the nares than intermittent carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. When volunteers were decolonized and were then inoculated with a mixture of <italic>S. aureus </italic>strains non-carriers eliminated the bacteria, whereas persistent carriers selected their original <italic>S. aureus </italic>colonizing strain from the mixture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These results indicate that certain host characteristics determine carriage status in particular individuals. This view is supported by the fact that certain age or ethnic groups seem to be predisposed to carriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. One determinant of varying patterns of nasal carriage may be differing expression levels of ligands for <italic>S. aureus </italic>on the surface of desquamated nasal epithelial cells.</p><p>In this study we used three donors to provide the desquamated nasal epithelial cells for adhesion experiments. They were selected because their cells supported a consistent level of adhesion. It has been noted that cells from different donors can provide widely variable levels of adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The reason for this is not known. One possibility is different levels of expression of the ligands responsible for adherence promoted by one or more of the <italic>S. aureus </italic>surface proteins. It is imperative to perform a detailed comparative study of the ability of the surface proteins described here to support adhesion of bacteria to squamous cells from donors who are persistent carriers and those who are non-carriers. This could contribute to the knowledge of the contribution of host factors to carriage.</p><p>Surface proteins ClfB and IsdA have previously been shown to promote adhesion to squamous epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and are required for colonization of the nares of rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

It is possible that differences in the level of expression of these proteins could contribute to the variation in carriage of <italic>S. aureus </italic>in the nares.</p><p>To investigate the contribution of each of five surface proteins (IsdA, ClfB, SdrC, SdrD and SdrE) to squamous cell adhesion, the proteins were expressed from the surrogate host <italic>L. lactis</italic>. Expression of IsdA, ClfB, SdrC and SdrD each resulted in increased adherence. Gene disruption and complementation experiments in <italic>S. aureus </italic>also showed a role for IsdA, ClfB, SdrC and SdrD in adhesion. SdrE did not promote adhesion by either <italic>L. lactis </italic>or <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Schaffer <italic>et al </italic>2006 investigated whether SdrC or SdrD had a role in colonization of the nares in a mouse model. Mutants defective in SdrC or SdrD colonized mice to the same extent as the wild-type indicating that these proteins do not play a role colonization of the nares of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, this does not necessarily mean that SdrC and SdrD have no role to play in colonization of the human nares.</p><p>Adherence to desquamated epithelial cells from the anterior nares is clearly multifactorial. When expression of IsdA, ClfB, SdrC and SdrD was disrupted in strain Newman the level of adherence was reduced to background. This does not support a role for wall teichoic acid (WTA) in promoting adhesion to squamous cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. SasG did not play a role in adherence of Newman to squamous cells because this protein was not expressed detectably by this strain despite the intact <italic>sasG </italic>gene being present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. SasG might play a role in clinical isolates where expression occurs at higher levels.</p><p>It has been reported that WTA plays a prominent part in nasal colonization of the cotton rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The authors also demonstrated that teichoic acid promoted bacterial adhesion to normal epithelial cells. However the WTA apparently does not contribute to bacterial adhesion to desquamated nasal cells epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This is consistent with the data reported here which indicates that only surface proteins are required for adhesion to squames. A multiple mutant defective in ClfB, SdrC, SdrD and IsdA did not adhere. If WTA contributed to adherence the multiple mutant would still have bound above background levels. Thus colonization of the cotton rat requires both WTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and surface proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] albeit at different stages in the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and in different parts of the nares.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Eradication of carriage of <italic>S. aureus </italic>has been shown to reduce infection rates in dialysis, diabetic and AIDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].

It has been suggested that immune responses in part determine the ability of humans to carry <italic>S. aureus </italic>in the nares. This study has confirmed the role of ClfB and IsdA in adhesion to desquamated nasal epithelial cells and has revealed important roles for SdrC and SdrD. Vaccination against two or more of these surface proteins could provide significant reduction in carriage and could potentially reduce the rate of infection and dissemination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Growth conditions</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli </italic>strains were grown on Luria (L) agar or in L-broth (Difco). <italic>S. aureus </italic>strains were grown on tryptic soy agar (TSA; Oxoid), tryptic soy broth (TSB) or RPMI 1640 (Sigma).
