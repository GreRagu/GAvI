Therapeutic options remain limited despite a substantial number of approaches that have been tested clinically. In particular, various neurotrophic factors have been investigated. Failure in these trials has been largely ascribed to problems of insufficient dosing or inability to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB). We have recently uncovered the neurotrophic properties of the haematopoietic protein granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The protein is clinically well tolerated and crosses the intact BBB. This study examined the potential role of G-CSF in motoneuron diseases. We investigated the expression of the G-CSF receptor in motoneurons and studied effects of G-CSF in a motoneuron cell line and in the SOD1(G93A) transgenic mouse model. The neurotrophic growth factor was applied both by continuous subcutaneous delivery and CNS-targeted transgenic overexpression. This study shows that given at the stage of the disease where muscle denervation is already evident, G-CSF leads to significant improvement in motor performance, delays the onset of severe motor impairment and prolongs overall survival of SOD1(G93A)tg mice. The G-CSF receptor is expressed by motoneurons and G-CSF protects cultured motoneuronal cells from apoptosis. In ALS mice, G-CSF increased survival of motoneurons and decreased muscular denervation atrophy. We conclude that G-CSF is a novel neurotrophic factor for motoneurons that is an attractive and feasible drug candidate for the treatment of ALS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ALS</kwd><kwd>growth factor</kwd><kwd>drug candidate</kwd><kwd>functional outcome</kwd><kwd>motoneuron survival</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable fatal motoneuron disease with a lifetime risk of 1:800. It is characterized by progressive weakness, muscle wasting and death ensuing 3&#x02013;5 years after diagnosis (Mitchell and Borasio, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2007</xref>). Currently, the only available treatment option is riluzole that prolongs life by 2&#x02013;3 months, with questionable functional improvement (Miller <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2007</xref>). The causes of sporadic ALS are unknown but several genes have been identified that pose a genetic risk of developing ALS (Dunckley <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2007</xref>). In contrast, a number of genes have been identified that, when mutated, cause familial ALS. The best studied of those are mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), responsible for about 2% of all ALS cases.</p><p>A number of drug candidates have been proposed but failed in clinical trials. Several reasons have been put forward for this failure, including inability to pass the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, intolerable side effects and insufficient dosing. Since the exact disease-causing mechanism(s) is unclear at present, a rational approach is to give general trophic support to motoneurons, e.g. by growth factors.</p><p>We have recently uncovered the neuroprotective and regenerative properties of the haematopoietic growth factor, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2005</xref>; Schabitz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2008</xref>). Receptors for this factor are present in different brain regions with predominantly neuronal localization (Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2005</xref>). G-CSF improves outcome in various stroke models, both with regard to infarct size (Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2006</xref>) and long-term functional recovery (Gibson <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2005</xref>; Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2006</xref>). Together with EPO and the newly discovered neuronal effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (Kruger <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2007</xref>; Schabitz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2008</xref>), these proteins form a novel class of neurotrophic factors. G-CSF is a 19.6 kDa protein that also passes the intact blood&#x02013;brain barrier, allowing for peripheral delivery of this protein for the treatment of neurological conditions (Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2005</xref>; Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2007</xref>).</p><p>A major practical advantage of these factors in the treatment of diseases of the brain is their demonstrated safety profile in the traditional clinical indications. G-CSF is clinically used for chemotherapy-associated neutropaenia and stem cell harvesting. In this study, we show that G-CSF is a novel drug candidate for the treatment of ALS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>ALS model</title><p>We used mice transgenic for the SOD1(G93A) mutation (Gurney <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1994</xref>) on a C57BL/6 background (B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1-G93A)1Gur/J strain; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbour, ME, USA), harbouring the high copy number of the mutant allele human SOD1. The hemizygous line was maintained by mating transgenic males with C57BL/6 wild-type females. Transgenic females were used in all experiments. Experiments were performed in a total of four sequential, age-matched cohorts with equally distributed siblings to treatment and control groups.</p><sec><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>G-CSF (filgrastim, AMGEN, Thousand Oaks; 30 &#x000b5;g/kg/day) was delivered continuously via an osmotic, subcutaneously implanted, paravertebrally located minipump (Alzet Minipump, model 2004; ALZET Osmotic Pumps, Cupertino, CA, USA). The solvent or vehicle consisted of 250 mM sorbitol, 0.004% Tween-80 and 10 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4). Treatment was initiated in all mice at 11 weeks (77 days) of age, for a total of 8 weeks. The minipump was replaced once after 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of disease progression</title><p>Rotarod performance was assessed weekly using the accelerating mode from 3 to 30 r.p.m. Cutoff time was 470 s. Mean of three testings was recorded. Grip strength measurements were done weekly. Mean of three testings was recorded. Clinical onset of disease was defined as the beginning of paralysis of one limb (hind limb). Onset of disease by quantitative tests was defined as a drop in performance to &#x0003c;80% of the initial value (rotarod and grip strength measurements). Clinical end stage was defined as the inability of the animal to right itself over a period of 30 s. Animals were sacrificed at that point. By rotarod and grip strength analysis, clinical end stage was defined as a drop in performance to &#x0003c;20% of the initial value.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sciatic nerve axotomy</title><p>Wild-type mice were anaesthetized using isofluran/N<sub>2</sub>O anaesthesia. The left hind leg was slightly stretched and fixated. After dorsal skin incision, the sciatic nerve was carefully exposed and completely cut through with microscissors, 5 mm proximal to the bifurcation of the tibial and common peroneal nerve. ALZET minipumps were implanted as above. After 4 weeks, animals were sacrificed and muscles subjected to histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Polymerase chain reaction analysis of differentiated NSC34 cells</title><p>NSC34 cells were obtained from Dr Neil Cashman (University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada).

Cells were differentiated as described earlier. Differentiated cells were seeded into 96-well plates (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) for 2 days. To elicit programmed cell death cells were treated with 1 &#x000b5;M staurosporine (Merck-Calbiochem) for 5 h with or without recombinant human G-CSF (Filgrastim, AMGEN) at a concentration of 50 ng/ml.

Eight independent data points were generated for each treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Akt phosphorylation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</title><p>To determine possible activation of Akt kinase in NSC34 cells by G-CSF, we utilized the phosphoAkt-Elisa Kit (R&#x00026;D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany). NSC34 cells were seeded with differentiation medium into 24-well plates at a density of 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well for 3 days. Vehicle or G-CSF was added to a concentration of 50 ng/ml. Treated groups were lysed after 10 or 60 min, the vehicle control at 60 min. The cell lysate was processed according to manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, the whole lysate was added to the test plate, incubated for 2 h at room temperature and developed with a streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase substrate. Optical densities were measured at 450 and 570 nm (Fluostar, BMG Laboratories, Germany) and pAkt levels were derived from the difference in optical densities and a standard curve and normalized to cell numbers. Absolute values were measured as nanogram per 10<sup>4</sup> cells and converted to relative levels. Four independent data points were obtained for each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>After deep anaesthesia, mice were transcardially perfused with Hank's balanced salt solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde; spinal cords were removed and embedded in paraffin. For G-CSF receptor immunohistochemistry on human spinal cord (tissue kindly provided by Dr J.P. Loeffler, Universit&#x000e9; Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France), sections of paraffin-embedded tissues (10 &#x000b5;m) were deparaffinated and microwaved (citrate buffer at 600 W for 15 min). After overnight incubation of sections at 4&#x000b0;C with the G-CSF receptor antiserum (SC-694; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA; 1:100), staining was visualized using the ABC technique with 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzidine hydrochloride as chromogen (DAKO). For double-immunofluorescence, sections of paraffin-embedded tissues (10 &#x000b5;m) were deparaffinated and microwaved as described above. Thereafter, sections were incubated at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, simultaneously with the GCSF receptor antiserum (SC-694; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA; 1:100), the calcitonin gene-related peptide antibody (1720-9007; Biogenesis Ltd, Poole, UK; 1:200), the ChAT antibody (AB144P; Chemicon Europe Ltd, UK; 1:100) or the GFAP antibody (MAB 360; Chemicon Europe Ltd, UK; 1:100). After enhancing the G-CSF receptor staining by adding biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany; 1:200), sections were incubated with streptavidin-coupled fluorophore (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany; 1:200) or the appropriate fluorescence-coupled secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany; 1:200). The nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, 1:10 000).

This denervation atrophy is typically more patchy in contrast to peripheral nerve lesions due to the stochastic nature of neuronal cell death. We asked whether we could detect any correlate to the strongly improved motor performance in hind limb skeletal muscle histology. When measuring intrafascial diameters of the M. rectus femoris of the quadriceps group at 15 weeks of age (after 4 weeks of treatment), we detected strong muscular atrophy in the vehicle-treated SOD1-tg mice in comparison to wt littermates. In contrast, the G-CSF-treated group had significantly larger muscle diameters (55% increase in diameter, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>D). In individual muscle fibres, we noted a significant decrease in muscle fibre cross-sectional area in the SOD1-tg animals, which was improved by G-CSF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>E).

We studied chronic denervation caused by unilateral sciatic nerve dissection. Analysis of cross-sectional areas of the M. tibialis anterior 4 weeks after denervation indicated the expected decrease in muscle diameter on the lesion side but G-CSF did not increase the median diameter on the lesioned or the unlesioned side (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/awn243/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S7</ext-link>). Therefore, the effect seen in the SOD1(G93A) model is most probably caused by direct actions of G-CSF on motoneurons.</p><p>We therefore determined numbers and size distribution of &#x003b1;-motoneurons in the lumbar spinal cord of the SOD-1 tg mice at 15 weeks of age that were defined as (i) being situated in the ventral horn; (ii) having a clearly identifiable nucleolus; (iii) having a minimum cross-sectional area of 400 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> and (iv) staining positive for CHAT. This combination of criteria was chosen to guarantee identification of alpha motoneurons with high specificity (Weber <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">1997</xref>), which are critical for disease progression [e.g. in contrast to &#x003b3; motoneurons, see Mohajeri <italic>et al.</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1998</xref>)]. We also noted motoneurons with strong or weak CHAT expression. As expected, motoneuron numbers were significantly decreased in the SOD1(G93A) mutant mice as compared with wt mice. This loss was ameliorated by G-CSF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>A and B). This beneficial effect was relatively stronger in the population of neurons displaying strong CHAT reactivity, presumably those with higher activity or larger motor fields. Regarding size distribution, we noted that the SOD1(G93A) transgene, in addition to a loss in motoneuron numbers, led to a remarkable downward shift in the remaining motoneuron size, likely due to a more selective demise of larger motoneurons or shrinkage of already damaged motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>B and C).<fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>G-CSF improves motoneuron survival in SOD1-tg mice.

Performance in the rotarod and grip strength tests was significantly improved in mice with the Thy1-tta allele in comparison to littermates without the driver transgene (not shown).

The genes responsible for several familial ALS forms have been identified and provide novel hints to cellular events that may are involved in ALS pathophysiology. The best-studied mutation and model are SOD1 mutations. However, intense research into the mechanism responsible for the ALS phenotpye of SOD1 mutations has generated a number of novel unexpected questions, most notably on the motoneuron-intrinsic versus a tissue-environmental effect of the mutated SODs (Beers <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2006</xref>; Boillee <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2006</xref>; Miller <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2006</xref>; Nagai <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2007</xref>).</p><p>Disease-causing mechanisms that have been proposed include glutamate toxicity, mitochondrial dysfunctions and impaired energy metabolism, oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species, protein aggregation pathology, impaired axonal transport, inflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms and others (McGeer and McGeer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2005</xref>; Carri <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2006</xref>; Vincent <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2008</xref>). These hypotheses have led to a large number of trials that have not led to the introduction of novel drugs for ALS patients with the exception of riluzole, a glutamate modifier with modest efficacy. One possible reason for the clinical failure of a large number of drug candidates may be the complexity of the different cell types and mechanisms involved and the use of drug cocktails and combination therapies has been suggested as a remedy (Carri <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2006</xref>). However, clinical development of combination therapies is problematic.</p><p>In the absence of an identified singular decisive pathogenic process, providing generic trophic support to motoneurons by growth factors remains a highly rational approach. Currently, two of the most promising candidates for treatment are the proteins IGF1 (Kaspar <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2003</xref>) and VEGF (Azzouz <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2004</xref>; Storkebaum <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2005</xref>). Indeed, one trial with recombinant IGF-1 had a positive outcome (Lai <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1997</xref>). Here we have shown that the haematopoietic growth factor G-CSF is effective in improving functional parameters and prolonging survival in the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of familial ALS.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of action of G-CSF</title><p>SOD1 transgenic animals treated with G-CSF demonstrate beneficial effects along the motor pathway: There are more surviving motoneurons in the spinal cord that also appear functionally more intact with larger diameters, electromyographic signs of denervation are reduced, muscle mass is increased and animals show increased strength and endurance and finally, increased survival. The effect of G-CSF is most likely caused by direct protection of motoneurons, as motoneurons in the spinal cord strongly express the receptor for G-CSF, G-CSF is directly protective in a motoneuronal cell line in culture and transgenic overexpression of G-CSF in the CNS improves outcome. At present we have no indication that glial cells might be involved in mediating G-CSF's action: astrocytes and most microglia do not express the receptor and the numbers of these cell types in the SOD1 model are not strongly altered by treatment. It might be possible that immunomodulatory activities of G-CSF also play a role.</p><p>We have observed higher PLP mRNA levels in the G-CSF-treated SOD1 transgenic mice. This effect could be indirect or direct. Either there is indeed separate enhancement/rescue of oligodendrocyte function in the SOD1 model or, more likely, the higher PLP expression simply reflects the presence of more surviving motoneurons and thus myelinated axons.</p></sec><sec><title>Upregulation of G-CSF in the SOD1-tg model</title><p>We see induction of G-CSF and G-CSF receptor in spinal cords of SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice. Upregulation of G-CSF was also reported by Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>) in the CSF of ALS patients using an ELISA approach. However, while upregulation of G-CSF receptor was very prominent in the ALS mouse model, Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>) report downregulation of the receptor in the spinal cord of ALS patients. These data were generated using measurements of optical density of immunoreactivity from light microscopic precipitation stains. This is a methodologically questionable approach and likely not possible without using double-fluorescent staining against an unaltered protein as standard (Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2004</xref>). This methodological problem is underlined by the fact that Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>) could not confirm alterations of G-CSF levels by this approach. We consistently see upregulation of the G-CSF receptor as a reaction to different disease stimuli in the nervous system and believe that this represents an endogenous protective response of neurons (Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2005</xref>). We therefore believe that the question of regulation of the G-CSF receptor in ALS patients and possible correlation to the mouse model is open at present.</p></sec><sec><title>Predictiveness of the SOD1-tg model</title><p>Recently the predictive value of the SOD1-tg model has been questioned mostly because a human trial with the positively tested drug minocycline demonstrated significant worsening of disease progression in the active arm (Gordon <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2007</xref>). However, the SOD1-tg model remains the only model that reproduces the main features of the human disease. A possible explanation of the discrepancy between successfully tested drugs in the model and failures in the clinical trials is inadequate conduction of preclinical studies (Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2008</xref>). Our study relied on a fully blinded (both for treatment allocation as well as outcome measures) and randomized design using littermate and age matching. The effects have also been confirmed by a different delivery approach, transgenic overexpression. We are therefore confident that our results represent true effects of G-CSF. Of note, we have also started treatment at a time when SOD1 mice already display clear electromyographic denervation signs.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect size</title><p>We have observed a total benefit in survival by 7% with systemic delivery of G-CSF (or about 10% by a transgenic approach) and an overall increase in strength and endurance by about 40% during the observation period. It is possible that prolonging treatment beyond the 8 week period could have further increased the survival benefit. The observed effect on survival might appear moderate; it is however very difficult to compare this with other studies in this model due to substantial differences in experimental conditions between the animal studies performed to date (Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2008</xref>). In general, very large effects on survival have only been obtained by siRNA targeting of the disease-causing protein itself or by viral delivery of proteins. In contrast, the effects observed on motor performance are remarkably strong and it is tempting to speculate that this might translate to longer periods of independence for human patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical application of G-CSF</title><p>G-CSF may have considerable practical advantages over other discussed growth factors for the treatment of ALS: It has a safe clinical track record in other indications (Hubel and Engert, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2003</xref>), is generally well tolerated, passes the intact blood&#x02013;brain barrier (Schneider <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2005</xref>; Zhao <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2007</xref>) and has already entered clinical development in another neurological disorder, stroke (Schabitz and Schneider, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2007</xref>). In addition, the pharmacology of G-CSF is extremely well understood. Translation to clinical development of G-CSF in ALS and possibly other motoneuron disorders appears very feasible.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="awn243_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="awn243_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="awn243_2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="awn243_3.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="awn243_4.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="awn243_5.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="awn243_6.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="awn243_7.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="awn243_8.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the excellent technical assistance of Claudia Heuthe, Sandra Ellering, Ulrike Bolz, Frank Herzog and Gisela Eisenhardt.
