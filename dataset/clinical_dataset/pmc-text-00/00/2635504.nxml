Auxin is required for lateral root formation, and mutants that are altered in auxin synthesis, transport or signaling often have lateral root defects. Crosstalk between auxin and ethylene in root elongation has been demonstrated, but interactions between these hormones in the regulation of Arabidopsis lateral root formation are not well characterized. This study utilized Arabidopsis mutants altered in ethylene signaling and synthesis to explore the role of ethylene in lateral root formation. We find that enhanced ethylene synthesis or signaling, through the <italic>eto1-1</italic> and <italic>ctr1-1</italic> mutations, or through the application of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), negatively impacts lateral root formation, and is reversible by treatment with the ethylene antagonist, silver nitrate. In contrast, mutations that block ethylene responses, <italic>etr1-3</italic> and <italic>ein2-5</italic>, enhance root formation and render it insensitive to the effect of ACC, even though these mutants have reduced root elongation at high ACC doses. ACC treatments or the <italic>eto1-1</italic> mutation significantly enhance radiolabeled indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) transport in both the acropetal and the basipetal directions. <italic>ein2-5</italic> and <italic>etr1-3</italic> have less acropetal IAA transport, and transport is no longer regulated by ACC. DR5-GUS reporter expression is also altered by ACC treatment, which is consistent with transport differences. The <italic>aux1-7</italic> mutant, which has a defect in an IAA influx protein, is insensitive to the ethylene inhibition of root formation. <italic>aux1-7</italic> also has ACC-insensitive acropetal and basipetal IAA transport, as well as altered DR5-GUS expression, which is consistent with ethylene altering AUX1-mediated IAA uptake, and thereby blocking lateral root formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>auxin</kwd><kwd>ethylene</kwd><kwd>lateral roots</kwd><kwd>auxin transport</kwd><kwd>AUX1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants have an impressive ability to adapt their root development to maximize both reproductive success and survival in harsh environments. Primary roots are formed in the embryo and emerge from the seed during germination. Newly emerged roots are exquisitely sensitive to environmental signals, such as gravity, which acts as a cue to direct root growth towards the moisture and nutrients found below the soil surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Muday and Rahman, 2007)</xref>. As roots mature, quiescent cells within their pericycle begin dividing and undergo a precise series of divisions to form a lateral root primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Malamy, 2008)</xref>. Ultimately, the lateral root elongates and undergoes further reiterative branching. The resulting complex root architecture allows maximal nutrient uptake and creates the underground support network that is essential for anchoring the plant.</p><p>Auxin has been strongly linked to root growth orientation and lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Casimiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Malamy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Teale <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Elevated concentrations of auxin, achieved by auxin application or enhanced synthesis, increase root branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Boerjan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Celenza <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Laskowski <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Sitbon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Torrey, 1976</xref>). Auxin, with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) being the predominant naturally occurring auxin, acts at the earliest stages of lateral root primordia initiation, during the activation of the previously quiescent pericycle cells, to begin division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Himanen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Plants with mutations that alter auxin signaling or auxin transport have defects in lateral root initiation or elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Malamy, 2008</xref>). As auxin transport is a highly regulated process, flexible delivery of auxin to the pericycle cells from which lateral roots initiate is a logical mechanism to tie root development to environmental signaling.</p><p>Polar auxin transport occurs via cell-to-cell movement of this hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Leyser, 2006</xref>). In roots, IAA moves acropetally (from the shoot towards the root apex) through the central cylinder, and moves basipetally (from the root apex toward the base) through the outer root layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Muday and DeLong, 2001</xref>). Auxin transport proteins include IAA efflux carrier complexes, which may include both PIN (pinformed) and ABCB (ATP binding cassette-type B) transporters, also known as MDR/PGP (multidrug resistance-like/P-glycoprotein) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Blakeslee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and IAA influx carriers including AUX1 (auxin insensitive) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bennett <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and perhaps ABCB4/PGP4/MDR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Blakeslee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Cho <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Terasaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). These transporters were identified through mutant phenotypes that were linked to auxin transport dependent processes, such as gravitropism, and altered inflorescence and root architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Blakeslee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Lewis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Noh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Okada <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and have been shown to mediate IAA movements across membranes in heterologous expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Blakeslee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Geisler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Petrasek <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Terasaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In particular, <italic>mdr1/pgp19</italic> has reduced acropetal IAA transport, and forms wild-type numbers of lateral roots, but these lateral roots exhibit reduced elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <italic>aux1</italic> has reduced basipetal and acropetal IAA transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Rashotte <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">2003</xref>), and has significant reductions in lateral root formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Marchant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Yet, the source of the auxin that reaches the pericycle cells to enhance root formation is still unclear. Inhibition of auxin movement from the shoot into the root reduces lateral root number and is reversible by auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Reed <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Similarly, quantification of IAA levels in seedlings during germination, and at the earliest stages of root development, suggest that a pulse of IAA moves into the root with timing appropriate to initiate lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bhalerao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Additionally, several studies have provided evidence in support of root tip-derived auxin driving root formation. The <italic>stm1</italic> (<italic>shoot meristemless</italic>) mutant, which presumably has reduced IAA synthesis because of missing leaves, still forms lateral roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Casimiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). An oscillation of DR5-GUS expression has recently been reported in the basal meristem, which might prime pericycle cells for lateral root initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">De Smet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Several recent reports have demonstrated crosstalk between auxin and ethylene in Arabidopsis. The hypocotyl and root gravity responses, which are auxin-dependent processes, are inhibited by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), the ethylene precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Buer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Muday <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), as is root waving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Buer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). This inhibition requires ETR1 and EIN2: two well-characterized ethylene signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Buer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Muday <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Root elongation is synergistically inhibited by IAA and ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">R&#x0016f;&#x0017e;i&#x0010d;ka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Stepanova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Swarup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The inhibition of root elongation by ACC is lost in the <italic>aux1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Rahman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">R&#x0016f;&#x0017e;i&#x0010d;ka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), which is consistent with AUX1's central role in the crosstalk between these hormones. Additionally, <italic>arf19</italic>, which has altered auxin-induced gene expression, is less sensitive to the effect of ethylene on root elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>One mechanism for the synergy between auxin and ethylene is the positive regulation of auxin synthesis by ethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Stepanova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">2007</xref>). Another interaction may be through regulation of auxin transport. In some species, ethylene inhibits polar IAA transport in shoot tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Morgan and Gausman, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Suttle, 1988</xref>), and in roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Prayitno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Lateral IAA transport in response to gravity is inhibited in both shoots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Burg and Burg, 1966</xref>) and gravity-stimulated corn roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>), suggesting that the ethylene-mediated inhibition of auxin transport may regulate the gravity response. Consistent with these transport studies, ACC reduces gravitropism in Arabidopsis roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Buer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and hypocotyls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Muday <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) through EIN2- and ETR-dependent mechanisms.</p><p>Few reports in the literature have used the array of mutants altered in ethylene signaling or synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alonso and Stepanova, 2004</xref>) to examine the role of ethylene in lateral root formation. The <italic>etr1</italic> and <italic>Neverripe</italic> (<italic>Nr</italic>) mutants of Arabidopsis and tomato, respectively, have reduced ethylene response resulting from the dominant-negative versions of membrane ethylene receptors described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Bleecker <italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">O&#x02019;Malley <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref>. The <italic>Nr</italic> tomato mutant has increased underground root mass, consistent with enhanced lateral root formation, but the formation of lateral roots on young <italic>Nr</italic> seedlings was not examined, although alterations in adventitious root formation were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). The <italic>ein2</italic> mutant is also ethylene insensitive, but the biochemical function of EIN2 has not been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Alonso and Stepanova, 2004</xref>). The constitutive triple-response <italic>ctr1</italic> mutant has enhanced ethylene signaling caused by a defect in a gene with sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of the Raf protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Kieber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). The ethylene overproduction mutant, <italic>eto1-3</italic>, has a defect in an ACC synthase gene that stabilizes the protein, thereby enhancing ethylene synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Chae and Kieber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Guzman and Ecker, 1990</xref>). The <italic>polaris</italic> (<italic>pls</italic>) mutant has hallmarks of enhanced ethylene signaling and has reduced lateral root formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Chilley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The <italic>pls</italic> mutant has reduced IAA transport in the inflorescence and reduced IAA accumulation in roots, consistent with a linkage between ethylene and auxin transport, yet IAA transport and lateral root phenotypes of other well-characterized Arabidopsis ethylene mutants were not described in this or in other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Chilley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>This study examined the process of lateral root formation in Arabidopsis seedlings, and tested the hypothesis that root branching is controlled by crosstalk between the plant hormones auxin and ethylene. We examined this question by taking advantage of the diversity of well-characterized mutants that have altered ethylene synthesis and signaling, and by treatments that alter the levels of ethylene in seedlings. We tested the hypothesis that ethylene alters rooting by modulation of polar IAA transport, and have explored the role of the AUX1 protein in mediating the crosstalk between auxin and ethylene in the control of lateral root formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Lateral root numbers are altered in ethylene-signaling mutants</title><p>We examined the role of ethylene in root formation using a genetic approach to alter ethylene concentrations and responsiveness.

When acropetal IAA transport is enhanced by elevated ethylene synthesis or signaling, perhaps this limits the quantity of auxin that can leave the polar transport stream to be taken up into pericycle cells to stimulate root formation.

Like lateral root formation, there is a significant reduction in the ability of ACC to regulate acropetal IAA transport in <italic>aux1-7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Figure 7b</xref>). Although there is still a significant stimulation of transport by ACC in <italic>aux1-7</italic> relative to untreated <italic>aux1-7</italic>, there is a significant difference between ACC-treated genotypes.

Elevated levels of ethylene, either achieved through the application of ACC or by enhanced ethylene synthesis in <italic>eto1</italic>, reduced the numbers of lateral roots and primary root elongation growth. This effect is reversible by treatment with silver nitrate, an ethylene antagonist. Similarly, the constitutive ethylene signaling <italic>ctr1</italic> mutant shows reduced numbers of lateral roots. The effect of enhanced ethylene synthesis and signaling is at the level of root initiation, as quantification of lateral root primordia with a <italic>cycl1At</italic>-GUS reporter line demonstrates reductions in the numbers of all stages of lateral roots, with the most profound effect on early stages of lateral root formation. In contrast, mutants with reduced ethylene sensitivity, such as <italic>ein2</italic> and <italic>etr1</italic>, show enhanced lateral root formation. We find an ACC dose-dependent decrease in root branching in Columbia, which is absent in <italic>etr1</italic> and <italic>ein2</italic>.</p><p>These mutations or treatments that alter ethylene signaling or synthesis affect root elongation and lateral root formation in parallel. Calculations of lateral root density along the primary root are roughly constant with increasing ACC concentration in Col. The one exception is when <italic>etr1</italic> and <italic>ein2</italic> roots are treated with high doses of ACC, where the inhibition of root elongation is more profound, and so the lateral root density increases. This finding is consistent with a strong requirement for ETR and EIN2 function for ethylene regulation of root formation. Another study showed that the effect of ACC on lateral root density is relatively constant over a 25-fold ACC concentration range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Ivanchenko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). When the lateral root initiations are quantified for 100 cells, there are significant decreases in lateral root frequency at 0.2 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> ACC and above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Ivanchenko <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), suggesting that the examination of lateral root density alone does not provide accurate information on the cellular frequency of root formation.</p><p>The effect of ethylene on root formation is enhanced in regions nearer the growing tip that are formed after exposure to ACC (Figure S2). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Ivanchenko <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> quantified the number of lateral root initiation events in the mature root formed before transfer, and in the root formed after transfer to ACC. They found that the number of roots in the mature region is unchanged by ACC treatment, whereas there are fewer lateral roots initiated in the newly formed region at doses of ACC greater than 0.2 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>. Here, we have consistently reported on the total number of lateral roots formed in different treatments or mutants. This quantification does not change the conclusions about the effect of each treatment, although it may under-represent the magnitude of the negative effect of ethylene, as treated roots have greater effects in one region than in the whole root.</p><p>Several recent studies demonstrate crosstalk between ethylene and auxin in root elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Rahman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">R&#x0016f;&#x0017e;i&#x0010d;ka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Stepanova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Swarup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). These reports suggested that ethylene positively regulates IAA transport using auxin-responsive reporter constructs, which provide an indirect method of observation of IAA transport. These reporters provide information on the capacity to respond to IAA, as well as IAA concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">R&#x0016f;&#x0017e;i&#x0010d;ka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Stepanova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Swarup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). We directly tested the possibility that IAA transport was altered by ethylene signaling and synthesis by measuring the movement of radiolabeled IAA in whole living Arabidopsis seedlings, to understand the regulation of IAA transport by ethylene. Disruption of IAA transport with efflux inhibitors blocks lateral root initiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Casimiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Reed <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), so we hypothesized that ACC treatment would reduce IAA transport.</p><p>We find that rather than decreasing IAA transport, ACC treatment or the <italic>eto1</italic> mutation led to a 4- to 5-fold enhancement of root acropetal IAA transport relative to untreated Col roots, and to a twofold enhancement of basipetal IAA transport. Mutations that reduce ethylene responsiveness, <italic>etr1</italic> and <italic>ein2</italic>, reduce acropetal IAA transport and render it insensitive to the effects of ethylene. Finally, silver nitrate significantly reduces the enhanced acropetal IAA transport in ACC-treated seedlings and in the <italic>eto1</italic> mutant. DR5-GUS expression was examined as a secondary and indirect measure of changes in IAA distribution in response to ACC. In particular, the expression of DR5-GUS in the vascular tissues of the root, which are likely to mediate acropetal IAA transport, is enhanced in seedlings treated with 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> ACC, and silver nitrate prevents this enhancement. This finding is consistent with ethylene enhanced acropetal IAA transport, and our images resemble similar reports of changes in DR5-GUS in response to 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Stepanova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The positive effect of ethylene on auxin transport reported here was surprising, for several reasons. In some species, ethylene inhibits polar IAA transport in shoot tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Morgan and Gausman, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Suttle, 1988</xref>). A recent report indicates that in roots of <italic>Medicago</italic>, ethylene reduces acropetal IAA transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Prayitno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). As the <italic>Medicago</italic> roots were grown on nitrogen- and sucrose-free media under different light conditions, the resolution of whether this difference in the effect of ethylene on auxin transport are caused by species or growth-condition differences awaits additional experimentation.</p><p>Our initial hypothesis that ethylene-mediated reductions in lateral root formation would be accompanied by reduced IAA transport was not supported by the data. We therefore developed two alternative models to explain the enhanced polar IAA transport coupled with reduced branching. In the first model, we hypothesized that ethylene might reduce the ability of roots to respond to IAA. We tested this model by treating roots with ACC and IAA simultaneously, and we found that the Col and mutant lines continued to positively respond to IAA, even in the presence of ACC, although the majority of IAA-induced root formation occurs in the older parts of the root. Therefore, ACC does not uniformly block the auxin responsiveness of root formation.</p><p>As ethylene does not prevent the response to auxin, then the role of ethylene in controlling root branching is likely to alter the availability of auxin. As exogenous auxin enhances lateral root initiation at physiological, and well-above physiological, concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Poupart <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), perhaps the enhanced transport of auxin through the root limits the auxin that remains in the root to locally stimulate lateral root formation. Therefore, we developed the alternative hypothesis that the ethylene enhancement of polar IAA transport might alter the quantity of IAA that unloads into the pericycle cells to drive lateral root formation. AUX1 is the best-characterized influx carrier protein in Arabidopsis, the <italic>aux1</italic> mutant has defects in lateral root development and <italic>AUX1</italic> is expressed in developing lateral root primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Marchant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), suggesting that AUX1 is a likely target to mediate IAA influx into developing lateral root primordia to prime lateral root formation.</p><p>We therefore examined the effect of ACC on lateral root formation, and acropetal and basipetal IAA transport, in the <italic>aux1</italic> mutant. In <italic>aux1-7</italic>, lateral root formation is reduced, the effect of ACC on root formation is lost, and acropetal and basipetal IAA transport are less responsive to ACC treatment than in wild type. A mechanism by which transport is enhanced in the wild type may be through increased <italic>AUX1</italic> expression. This prediction is consistent with the previous report that ethylene enhances the expression of <italic>AUX1</italic> reporters after ACC treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">R&#x0016f;&#x0017e;i&#x0010d;ka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Together, these results are consistent with ethylene acting through AUX1 protein to enhance long-distance polar IAA transport, and to alter IAA availability for lateral root formation, by reducing levels in tissues stimulated by IAA to form lateral roots. As AUX1 has roles in acropetal and basipetal transport in primary roots, and may facilitate IAA transport into developing lateral roots, these experiments cannot yet dissect which transport stream is tied to the reduction in lateral root formation by ethylene. Furthermore, elucidation of the mechanism by which auxin moves into the pericycle cells, from which lateral roots are initiated, awaits additional experimentation.</p><p>Several reports have uncovered mechanisms for the synergistic negative regulation of root elongation by auxin and ethylene, including crosstalk between the synthesis of auxin and ethylene. Auxin positively regulates ethylene biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Woeste <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) through auxin-inducible expression of ACC synthase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in ethylene synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abel <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Yamagami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Ethylene enhances auxin synthesis in the root tip through WEI2 and WEI7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">R&#x0016f;&#x0017e;i&#x0010d;ka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Stepanova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Swarup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). DR5-GUS and DR5-GFP expression have been shown to be enhanced in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">R&#x0016f;&#x0017e;i&#x0010d;ka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), whereas other reports indicate that DR5-GUS or IAA2-GUS are increased by elevated ethylene in the epidermis and central cylinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Stepanova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Swarup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). These reports are suggestive of ethylene-enhanced IAA transport in cells of the epidermis and central cylinder, which mediate basipetal and acropetal IAA transport, respectively. Finally, <italic>aux1</italic> is reduced in its response to the effect of ACC on root elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Rahman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Stepanova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Swarup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), which is consistent with the defective IAA transport of <italic>aux1</italic>. Together, these mechanisms for interactions between IAA and ethylene logically explain the experimental observations for the synergistic inhibition of primary root growth.</p><p>The mechanism for the IAA and ethylene antagonism during lateral root formation is more complex to dissect than the synergistic action of these two hormones on root elongation. Ethylene-enhanced IAA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Stepanova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Swarup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and IAA transport (this work) would be predicted to positively regulate lateral root formation, as elevations in endogenous and exogenous auxin stimulate lateral root development. An alternative possibility is that ethylene could prevent the response of pericycle cells to IAA, but the inability of ethylene to block IAA-enhanced root formation argues against this possibility.</p><p>We developed a more complex transport model, in which the IAA that was required to drive lateral root formation might reach the pericycle cells through a two-step process, in which polar transport and unloading into the pericycle cells may be unlinked. As ACC enhances both acropetal and basipetal IAA transport, we cannot resolve the stream of auxin that is tied to this process, and it is possible that both flows ultimately raise IAA levels in the basal meristematic region that has important signaling roles in lateral root formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">De Smet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), either directly or through a reflux loop that has been identified through genetic experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Blilou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Lewis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>We tested the possibility that AUX1 might be a critical player in controlling this balance of polar transport and IAA unloading into the pericycle in response to elevated ethylene levels. The absence of ethylene-enhanced polar transport and ethylene-inhibited lateral root formation in this mutant, and in influx inhibitor-treated seedlings, is consistent with the central importance of IAA uptake in lateral root development. These results are also consistent with previous reports that AUX1 plays a critical role in the interface between ethylene levels and the regulation of root growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Stepanova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Swarup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). As AUX1 is expressed in the root tip, in developing lateral roots and in the shoot meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Marchant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), it is not possible to determine which of these sites control the movement of auxin needed to inhibit lateral root formation in response to ethylene. The reduced acropetal transport in <italic>aux1</italic> may be caused by the altered loading of auxin from the leaves and cotyledons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Marchant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) into the acropetal IAA transport stream. Even though the role of AUX1 in mediating IAA transport is complex, AUX1 is clearly tied to ethylene-regulated root development.</p><p>Together, these experiments demonstrate a profound effect of ethylene on lateral root initiation in Arabidopsis, which works through the well-characterized ethylene signaling pathway. The effect is likely to be a result of crosstalk with auxin signaling and auxin transport pathways. These changes in lateral root initiation lead to new patterns of root architecture that may have adaptive significance under conditions in which ethylene is elevated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>Triton X-100 was purchased from Fisher Scientific (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fisher.co.uk">http://www.fisher.co.uk</ext-link>).

The number of lateral roots on the primary root was counted under a dissecting microscope after five additional days of growth; all lateral roots that had emerged from the primary root were counted.

Root segments were excised and the level of radioactivity quantified in two ways. For the first experiment with multiple genotypes, which have different primary root lengths, the roots were divided into 5-mm upper segments (upper being closest to the shoot), middle segments and a 5-mm lower segment (the root tip). For other assays, the roots were not significantly different from controls, so the apical 5 mm of each root tip was excised. Individual segments from each plant and position were placed in 2.5 ml of scintillation liquid [Scintiverse (TM) BD cocktail; Fisher Scientific) in 3-ml scintillation vials, and radioactivity was measured for 2 min on a Beckman scintillation counter (model LS 6500; Beckman Coulter, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.beckmancoulter.com">http://www.beckmancoulter.com</ext-link>).</p><p>Measurement of radioactive basipetal auxin transport was performed using the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Rashotte <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref>, using seedlings 5 days after sowing and 18 h after treatment with the indicated compounds.</p><p>&#x003b2;-Glucuronidase staining was performed with Columbia or <italic>aux1-7</italic> DR5-GUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Ulmasov <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>) and <italic>cyc1At</italic>-GUS seedlings according to previously published procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Buer and Muday, 2004</xref>).
