They belong to the family of ENaC/Degenerins whose members share a conserved structure but are activated by widely diverse stimuli. We show that interaction of two aromatic residues, Tyr-72, located immediately after the first transmembrane segment, and Trp-288, located at the tip of a loop of the extracellular domain directed toward the first transmembrane segment, is essential for proton activation of the acid-sensing ion channels. The subdomain containing Trp-288 is a module tethered to the rest of the extracellular domain by short linkers and intrasubunit interactions between residues in the putative &#x0201c;proton sensor.&#x0201d; Mutations in these two areas shift the apparent affinity of protons toward a more acidic range and change the kinetics of activation and desensitization. These results are consisting with displacement of the module relative to the rest of the extracellular domain to allow interaction of Trp-288 with Tyr-72 during gating. We propose that such interaction may provide functional coupling between the extracellular domain and the pore domain.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>DK544602</grant-num> (NIDDK).

Four ASIC genes in the human genome, ASIC1 to ASIC4, give rise to at least six isoforms that associate in various combinations to form channels with different functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). The ASICs constitute a distinct group in the large family of channels known as Degenerins characterized by a common structure but widely diverse gating stimuli: mechanical forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>), neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), or no stimulus at all, such as ENaC, which exhibits constitutive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). The structure shared by all Degenerins consists of two transmembrane segments, TM1 and TM2, a large extracellular domain, and short cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini. The recently published crystal structure of a truncated chicken ASIC1 (cASIC1) at a resolution of 1.9 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) shows that ASIC1 is a trimer, and it provides detailed structure of the large extracellular domain that is crucial for understanding the gating mechanism of the ASICs. A feature revealed by the atomic structure is a cluster of negatively and one positively charged residue in the interface of subdomain D (Arg-191), subdomain E (Asp-238 and Glu-239), and subdomain F (Asp-346 and Asp-350) (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) that was hypothesized to constitute the proton sensor. Furthermore, it was proposed that binding of protons to this site displaces subdomain F toward TM1 to open the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).</p><p>Although the solved atomic structure of cASIC1 provides a valuable tool to advance the understanding of how external protons activate the ASICs, it represents only a snapshot of the gating process thereby additional experimental evidence is needed to elucidate the gating mechanism. The general idea that conformational changes triggered by binding of the specific agonist to the extracellular domain of a ligand activated channel need to be transmitted to the transmembrane domain, where the pore gate is located, draws attention to the pair of closely located residues, Tyr-72 and Trp-288, as they provide a potential contact site between the extracellular and the transmembrane domains.</p><p>This study examines the functional role of the conserved residues, Tyr-72 and Trp-288, that are located distantly in the primary sequence but are brought to close proximity (&#x0223c;3.7 &#x000c5;) by the folding of the extracellular domain (ECD). This arrangement could provide a contact site between the ECD and TM1 whereby a conformation change of the ECD is transmitted to the pore gate in the transmembrane domain.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Electrophysiology and Two-electrode Voltage Clamp of Oocytes</italic>&#x02014;<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes were injected with 5 ng of cRNA in a volume of 50 nl and used after 2-4 days of incubation at 16 &#x000b0;C.

If possible, each oocyte was tested twice with the whole range of pH solutions. The average of the peak currents from each pH was normalized to the value of pH that produced maximal current. The mean and standard deviation were obtained, and the pH<sub>50</sub> was calculated according to the equation <italic>I</italic> = 1/(1 + (EC<sub>50</sub>/[H])<italic><sup>n</sup></italic>), where <italic>I</italic> is the normalized value for the test pH, EC<sub>50</sub> is the concentration of protons that induces half-maximal currents, and <italic>n</italic> is the Hill coefficient.

Substitution of any of them by Gly in rat ASIC1 makes channels unresponsive to pH as low as 4.0. The same positions were subsequently replaced by amino acids with different side chains as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Aromatic amino acids, Y, F, W, or H and swapping of the residues to Trp-72 and Tyr-288 produced functional channels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). By contrast, small or large aliphatic side chains, proline, or negatively charged residues eliminated proton-induced currents. Histidine substitutions in 72 and 288 and arginine in position 72 (Y72R), but not in position 288 (W288R), retained channel function. However, all these functional mutant channels expressed lower proton sensitivity and faster desensitization rate than WT ASIC1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

The functional effect of mutations of each of these conserved residues is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Substitution of Leu-284 by alanine was functional, but proline in the same position abolished current.

This observation rather suggests that the importance of the proline rests on correctly positioning the aromatic 288 in order to interact with the one in position 72. This occurs by the unique property of proline to bend the backbone of the protein, thereby changing the curvature of the loop or by <italic>cis-trans</italic> isomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). In either case the orientation of the aromatic ring in position 288 would be altered by the absence of proline in 287.</p><p><italic>The Linker Tethering Subdomain F to the Body of the Extracellular Domain Decreases Proton-activated Currents and Slows Activation of ASIC1</italic>&#x02014;Residue Pro-365 is conserved in all the ASIC channels. It is located in the short linker connecting subdomain F to the rest of the extracellular domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>a</italic></xref>); thereby it is poised to sense conformational changes that may displace subdomain F during the gating process. ASIC1 channels bearing the mutation P365A were functional but exhibited marked changes in properties; peak currents elicited by protons were small (wild type 12 &#x000b1; 5 <italic>versus</italic> 1.5 &#x000b1; 0.4 &#x003bc;A/oocyte), and kinetics of activation were slow (wild type 20 &#x000b1; 5.4 <italic>versus</italic> 2.75 &#x000b1; 1.2 s<sup>-1</sup>) as well as the desensitization rate (wild type 0.50 &#x000b1; 0.05 <italic>versus</italic> 0.18 &#x000b1; 0.08 s<sup>-1</sup>). Last, the rate of recovery from desensitization was slower than in wild type channels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>); indeed, recovery from desensitization was never complete but declined progressively until the currents disappeared even after increasing the interval between stimuli for a period as long as 5 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>F</italic></xref>). These changes in kinetics are consistent with subdomain F being part of the transduction mechanism that translates binding of protons to opening and closure of the pore.</p><p><italic>Negatively Charged Residues in the Putative Proton Sensor Change the pH<sub>50</sub> and Desensitization Rate of ASIC1</italic>&#x02014;The residues Glu-346 and Asp-350 in subdomain F directly face Asp-238 and Glu-239 in subdomain E and together with Arg-191 in subdomain D form a cluster of charges at the surface of each subunit that was originally proposed to constitute the proton sensor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>a</italic></xref>). Substitutions of Glu-346 and Asp-350 by Ala maintained functional channels, but the rates of desensitization became faster (wild type 0.48 &#x000b1; 0.08 s<sup>-1</sup> <italic>versus</italic> D350A 2.3 &#x000b1; 0.07 s<sup>-1</sup>), and the apparent affinity for protons decreased (wild type pH<sub>50</sub> 6.8 &#x000b1; 0.5 <italic>versus</italic> D350A pH<sub>50</sub> 5.5 &#x000b1; 0.6) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). Removal of the remaining charged residues, Asp-238, Glu-239, and Arg-191, further shifted the apparent pH<sub>50</sub> of activation toward more acidic pH, but mutant channels still retained the property of being activated by protons. Together these results indicate that protonation of residues in the intrasubunit interface of subdomains F and D affects the conformational changes of activation and, therefore, contributes to the apparent affinity for protons. Although each of these residues plays a role in defining the functional properties of wild type ASIC1, none singly nor all five together are sufficient to confer proton sensitivity to the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>); other residues must participate in making the &#x0201c;proton sensor.&#x0201d;</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Functional effects of amino acid substitutions in putative proton sensor.</bold> <italic>A</italic>, representative current traces of channels with additive substitutions of charged residues in the proton sensor for alanine elicited by pH 6.0.

As any combination of aromatic residues (Trp, Tyr, Phe, or His) when present in these two positions was able to keep ASIC responsive to protons, it is reasonable to conclude that the aromatic side chains in positions 72 and 288 interact and that the interaction is essential to preserve functional channels. All other mutants carrying nonaromatic residues, with the exception of Arg in position 72, did not open with a pH as low as 4.0, consistent with the notion that an aromatic-aromatic interaction, also termed &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; interaction, provides the lowest energy barrier between two functional states. Further evidence comes from double cycle mutant analysis conducted with channels having His in positions 72 and 288. These channels were functional but had reduced apparent affinity for protons. Of significance, the effect of the mutations on the apparent pH<sub>50</sub> was not additive, consistent with functional interaction between residues 72 and 288. The finding that His mutants exhibited lower affinity for protons indicates that the &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; interaction comprising imidazole rings is not as favorable as when it occurs between Tyr-, Phe, or Trp. We, therefore, interpret the absence of current when other residues occupy positions 72 or 288 to be the result of a shift in the apparent pH<sub>50</sub> toward a very acidic range (lower than pH 4.0) because of a high energy barrier between states. Such a shift prevented reaching enough low pH to open the mutant channels without damaging the oocytes. This interpretation is favored over disruption of channel structure or misfolding induced by the mutations because of robust surface expression of mutant channels, functional channels carrying arginine (Y72R) despite marked differences in properties between the side chain of arginine and aromatic amino acids, and because the corresponding mutations in ENaC, a channel structurally related to ASIC but not gated by protons, retained function.</p><p>Aromatic-aromatic interactions contribute to maintaining tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins by stabilizing contacts between subdomains and between proteins within a complex. Aromatic-aromatic interactions are characterized by a competition between the stacked and the T-shaped geometries, the latter being more frequent in proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). In the T-shape structure the planes of the ring are perpendicular to each other, and in the intermediate stacked, &#x0201c;edge-displaced,&#x0201d; the ring planes are parallel-displaced. This competition is strongly affected by polarity of the environment and the ability of the surrounding solvent to form hydrogen bonds. In the crystal structure of cASIC1, Tyr-72 and Trp-288 adopt a T-shape structure; whether this geometry changes in the open, closed, and desensitized states is not known, although the binding energy differences for Tyr/Trp pair would be in the order of 1 kcal/mol going from T-shaped to intermediate stacked and 1.6 kcal/mol to the staked geometry according to previous calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). These values are in the range of energy change between the open and close conformations of ASIC1.</p><p>The observation that pH solutions in the range of 6.0 to 4.0 open the mutant Y72R, but not Y72K or W288R, indicates that Arg in position 72 can functionally replace one of the aromatic rings in the pair. An explanation for such an unexpected finding is that the positively charged side chain of Arg can interact with the aromatic ring in 288, replacing the &#x003c0;-&#x003c0; interaction for a cation-&#x003c0; interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). In the cation-&#x003c0; interaction, side chains of aromatic amino acids provide a surface of negative electrostatic potential that can bind to cations through a predominantly electrostatic interaction. This is possible only when arginine is in position 72 because here the arginine side chain would point to the aromatic ring, whereas arginine in position 288 would point its side chain away from Tyr-72 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The preference of arginine over lysine can be explained by the fact that the face of the guanidinium ion of arginine is to some extent hydrophobic, thereby preferred by the innately hydrophobic aromatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Representation of Arg in positions 72 and 288 in ASIC1.</bold> The figure was obtained by substituting Tyr-72 and Trp-288 in the crystal structure of chicken ASIC1 by Arg to illustrate the relative position of the positively charged side chain with respect to the opposite aromatic residue.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0100966390005"></graphic></fig></p><p>Additional evidence for the importance of correct positioning of the aromatic rings in the Tyr-72/Trp-28 pair was provided by mutations in the loop holding Trp-288. This loop exhibits a tight bend in the crystal structure because of the presence of several conserved prolines that when mutated also abolish current, suggesting that the curvature of the loop or <italic>cis-trans</italic> isomerization of the prolines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) positions the aromatic ring of amino acid 288 to allow interaction with the aromatic at position 72.</p><p>The prediction that Trp-288 may move together with subdomain F during the gating process was supported indirectly by changes in apparent pH<sub>50</sub> and kinetics induced by point mutations in sites of contact of subdomain F with the rest of the ECD; <italic>i.e.</italic> the interface of subdomains F and E; the first through carbonyl-carboxylate interactions of residues Asp-346 with Asp-238 and Asp-350 with Glu-239 and the second through Pro-365, in a hinge-like structure connecting subdomain F to the rest of the ECD. Furthermore, our findings are in agreement with the recently published molecular dynamic analysis of cASIC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). A simulation in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions bound to the proton sensor were displaced by protons unveil conformational changes in subdomain F (thumb domain) that were largest in the loop containing Trp-288. Our results are somewhat reminiscent of the Cys-loop ligand-activated receptors, where the importance of the interface of the extracellular with the transmembrane domain in communicating conformational changes initiated in the ligand binding site to the gate of the pore has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that an aromatic interaction between Tyr-72 and Trp-288 is required for conferring proton sensitivity to the ASICs, most likely by stabilizing a conformation that promotes channel opening. Residues in the putative proton sensor and in the tethers that connect subdomain F to the rest of the body of the extracellular domain contribute to move subdomain F; thereby the aromatic ring of Trp-288 is placed in a position that allows it to interact with Tyr-72. Together these findings provide experimental support for the proposal that subdomain F is involved in ASIC1 gating.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Wemmie, J.
