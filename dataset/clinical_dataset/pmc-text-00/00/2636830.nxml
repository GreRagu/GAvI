During the last decade there was a breakthrough in understanding the function of introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The intron sequences were once considered to be junk DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], however, people have recently realized that some of them may be functional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These DNAs may harbor a variety of elements that regulate transcription, e.g., untranslated RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and splicing control elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Due to their functional properties, at least a fraction of intronic regions are likely to be evolving under the influence of natural selection, mostly purifying selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition, the structural units, the length and the GC content of first exons and introns, are likely to associate with functional elements in large genomes of complex organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The varieties of functional elements in introns are revealed to associate with the function of adjacent exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, the evolution of the exon-intron structure of eukaryotic genes becomes the emerged topic.</p><p>Recent studies have produced data that shed light on the pattern of intron properties, e.g., the variations of length, GC content, ordinal position in a gene (first intron, second intron, and so on) and divergence of intron sequences. Various factors are revealed to influence the intron size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For example, the insertion of transposable elements alters the size of introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Similarly, the frequency and size of deletion events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] leads to changes in intron size and the presence of regulatory elements and RNA genes influences the length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Alternative splicing can also change intron/exon size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. As a result, the factors controlling gene expression and regulation impose a selective constraint on intron size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Correlations among intron divergence, intron ordinal position and intron length were revealed, suggesting that the structure of introns may be under selection as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the relationship between intron length and GC content appears to be complicated. Gazave et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] showed that there was a strong negative correlation among intron length and GC content and divergence in primates, whereas Haddrill et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] found that the class of long introns had higher GC content and lower divergence than that of short introns in fruit fly.</p><p>Different from introns, there is little data about the patterns of exon properties or variations of exon-intron architecture. Only a few studies included the basic statistical analyses, such as the distribution of exon length, the average number of exons per gene from eukaryotic model organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and the chromosomal distributions of exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore, a systematic investigation of the properties of both exons and introns will provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms determining exon-intron architecture. The availability of multiple, complete eukaryotic genome sequences makes it possible to examine many fundamental evolutionary questions on the genome scale. Here, we performed an extensive analysis of relationships among length, ordinal position, GC content and divergence of both introns and exons on 13 eukaryotic genomes &#x02013; six mammals, two plant species, two fish species, chicken, fruit fly and worm. We selected these genomic comparisons because they covered a wide range of eukaryotic species.</p><p>Our data revealed three consistent patterns, which present in almost all of the genomes we analyzed. Elucidation of these common patterns provides a basis for understanding the factors responsible for organization of the eukaryotic genomes, and for describing the exon-intron architectures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Pattern of intron length and GC content</title><p>The complex relationships between intron length and GC content were revealed in human and fly genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A similar analysis for 13 eukaryotic species (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) showed that these patterns were different among species (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Fig. S1). For example, strong negative correlations (decay curve; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, Table S1) existed in all six mammalian genomes (human, chimpanzee, dog, cow, mouse and rat; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Fig. S1A), whereas strong positive correlations were present in fly, rice, zebrafish and worm genomes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Fig. S1C). Clearly, the relationships between intron length and GC content in different species are complicated, which may be associated with isochore structure of genomes. It is well-known that GC-rich isochores of vertebrate have short introns, while GC-poor isochores have very large introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Indeed, the patterns of intron length against GC content are different in GC-poor and GC-rich regions (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Fig. S1D).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Statistics of 13 genomes analyzed</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">Species</td><td align="center">Sequences used (Mb)<sup>1</sup></td><td align="center">CDS count<sup>2</sup></td><td align="center">Exon count<sup>3</sup></td><td align="center">Intron count</td><td align="center">Average Exon length (bp)</td><td align="center">Average Exon GC (%)</td><td align="center">Average Intron length (bp)</td><td align="center">Average Intron GC (%)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><italic>A. thaliana</italic></td><td align="right">119.2</td><td align="right">23488</td><td align="right">135697</td><td align="right">118838</td><td align="right">223.7</td><td align="right">44.1</td><td align="right">163.7</td><td align="right">32.7</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>B. taurus</italic></td><td align="right">2434</td><td align="right">16829</td><td align="right">162223</td><td align="right">151199</td><td align="right">162.3</td><td align="right">52.0</td><td align="right">4516.4</td><td align="right">46.9</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>C. elegans</italic></td><td align="right">100.3</td><td align="right">27123</td><td align="right">171102</td><td align="right">149895</td><td align="right">208.4</td><td align="right">43.0</td><td align="right">334.7</td><td align="right">29.1</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>C. familiaris</italic></td><td align="right">2445</td><td align="right">15960</td><td align="right">161238</td><td align="right">147118</td><td align="right">157.2</td><td align="right">50.6</td><td align="right">3535.5</td><td align="right">46.1</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></td><td align="right">118.4</td><td align="right">8119</td><td align="right">43847</td><td align="right">40732</td><td align="right">370.0</td><td align="right">52.7</td><td align="right">1530.7</td><td align="right">36.5</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>D. rerio</italic></td><td align="right">1547</td><td align="right">20256</td><td align="right">173438</td><td align="right">156972</td><td align="right">156.2</td><td align="right">48.7</td><td align="right">2276.4</td><td align="right">34.5</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>G. gallus</italic></td><td align="right">1032</td><td align="right">14367</td><td align="right">142329</td><td align="right">133690</td><td align="right">152.1</td><td align="right">48.2</td><td align="right">2811.8</td><td align="right">42.6</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>H. sapiens</italic></td><td align="right">3077</td><td align="right">40430</td><td align="right">381122</td><td align="right">378089</td><td align="right">162.7</td><td align="right">50.8</td><td align="right">5848.7</td><td align="right">45.9</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>M. musculus</italic></td><td align="right">2644</td><td align="right">30546</td><td align="right">254605</td><td align="right">243458</td><td align="right">170.5</td><td align="right">51.1</td><td align="right">4683.6</td><td align="right">46.0</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>O. sativa</italic></td><td align="right">372.1</td><td align="right">41046</td><td align="right">178106</td><td align="right">144863</td><td align="right">306.0</td><td align="right">51.0</td><td align="right">396.1</td><td align="right">37.7</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>P. troglodytes</italic></td><td align="right">3176</td><td align="right">30010</td><td align="right">296830</td><td align="right">287132</td><td align="right">156.2</td><td align="right">50.7</td><td align="right">6003.7</td><td align="right">45.3</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>R. norvegicus</italic></td><td align="right">2719</td><td align="right">22243</td><td align="right">195940</td><td align="right">186864</td><td align="right">172.9</td><td align="right">51.1</td><td align="right">4406.4</td><td align="right">46.3</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>T. nigroviridis</italic></td><td align="right">217.3</td><td align="right">15455</td><td align="right">122253</td><td align="right">108901</td><td align="right">174.3</td><td align="right">54.5</td><td align="right">599.5</td><td align="right">45.4</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Sequences used were all assembled chromosome sequences in the related databases;

This simple pattern was significantly present in all species analyzed. The longest introns within a species always have a similar level of GC contents ranging from 35&#x02013;45% in different species. However, short introns can have either low or high GC contents. Notably, in human genome, this pattern is present not only in the GC-poor isochores but also in GC-rich isochores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The consistent pattern observed among various species and isochores suggests that a common mechanism might lead to increased intron length.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Variation patterns of introns' length, as a function of GC content</bold>. Each dot contains 1000 introns (A-D). The species in A-C were grouped based on ranges of intron lengths, e.g., up to 16000 bp for mammals. L1, L2, H1, H2 and H3 in D represent five GC-isochore families in human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] which are different in GC content (0~0.37, 0.37~0.41, 0.41~0.46, 0.46~0.53, 0.53~1, respectively).

Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> depicts a decay curve formed between intron order and length for all these genomes, however, some of the correlations between intron order and GC content are more complicated (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Fig. S2A). A significant negative correlation (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) is present in the rice genome as well as in chicken and fly genomes. In mammalian genomes, the GC content of the first intron is significantly higher than the others, and thereafter no perceptible difference was seen. In the other genomes, e.g., worm and zebrafish, no clear variation was found. The results of the systematic investigation on many genomes suggested the intron length was not randomly distributed in the ordinal positions. However, while this supposition may be partly true for the distribution of intron GC content in the ordinal positions, no clear pattern was obtained for the genomes analyzed.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Variation patterns of intron (A) or exon length (B), as a function of its ordinal number</bold>.

When sorted by exon GC content from low to high, a quadratic correlation significantly fitted the data of all mammalian genomes (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Fig. S3D &#x00026; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, Table S1) as well as all other species (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Fig. S3E-F).

To test this hypothesis, we calculated all possible correlations among these specific traits between introns and exons, and found that some of traits were correlated. A close positive correlation was found between intron GC content and its flanking exon GC content (or either side, data not shown), and this was present in all analyzed genomes (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001; Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;C</xref> &#x00026; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, Table S1).

Our analysis confirmed this phenomenon not only in human genome but also in most of the other genomes analyzed (except for worm and fruit fly). For example, the last exon is about twice longer than the average length of the other exons in human. Therefore, we calculated the correlation between the length of other exons and their flanking introns. When removing the last exon from each of genes analyzed, a positive correlation was present between exon and intron length in all genomes (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001; Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D&#x02013;E</xref> &#x00026; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, Table S1), except for fly and worm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>), where a significantly negative correlation or a random distribution is present (P &#x0003c; 0.001). These results suggest that a longer exon is generally followed by a longer intron.

These findings suggested that there might be more pairwise correlations among divergence, length and ordinal position in introns and exons. Therefore, we calculated all possible pairwise correlations among those traits between human and chimpanzee and between two rice cultivars.

The strong correlations above, particularly between Ka and flanking introns, suggested that selection was involved in the high-to-low pattern of divergence as the increase of order number in both exon and intron. When an exon was under purifying selection or selective sweep, hitchhike effects could be present in its flanking introns. This effect may partly explain the close correlation of divergence between exon and flanking introns.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Correlation between nucleotide divergence (or exon's Ka) and ordinal position of introns (A &#x00026; B) or of exons (C &#x00026; D) and between intron and flanking exon divergence (or Ka) (E &#x00026; F)</bold>.

Notably, the decrease of exon (or intron) length, and GC content and divergence, with a corresponding increase of total number of exons (or introns), is always present in all genomes (data not shown for the other species), indicating that this is a general pattern in exon-intron variation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Basic patterns of intron-exon architecture</title><p>Our investigation of the variation patterns of exon-intron comparisons in 13 eukaryotic genomes revealed three basic patterns: an ordinal reduction of length and divergence in both exon and intron (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;D</xref>); a co-variation of GC content and divergence between exons and flanking introns (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E&#x02013;F</xref>); and a decrease of average exon (or intron) length, GC content and divergence as the increase of total exon numbers in a gene increased. The three basic patterns existed in almost all genomes analyzed and showed strong correlation (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001 normally) with a generally consistent variation pattern. In addition, a strong complicated correlation (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001 normally) exists between GC content and the length of introns (or exons), and this correlation is present in all genomes analyzed. Although more significant correlations were observed (e.g., between divergence and length of exons or introns), only these four patterns were consistent among species.</p><p>To assess the reliability of our observations, we did many different calculations for each pattern. For example, we calculated the length, GC content or divergence separately for the genes having different numbers of introns (or exons) for the pattern of ordinal reduction in introns and exons. In other words, we calculated the two-intron, three-intron... 9-intron and &#x0003e; 9-intron (or -exon) genes separately, to compare the genes with an equal number of introns or exons. We chose human and rice (or human <italic>vs. </italic>chimpanzee and rice Nipponbare <italic>vs. </italic>93-11) as examples to assess the consistency (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Fig. S5 &#x02013; S6). Indeed, our calculations confirmed that the basic patterns observed are reliable, although those depicted in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> are not always present in the gene groups with equal number of exons or introns in the comparison of two rice lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms and evolutionary forces underlying the basic variation patterns</title><p>The first systematic analysis of 13 eukaryotic species revealed there are three general patterns of exon-intron structure variation. Although the mechanisms (or factors) that cause these patterns remain unclear, our results provide some clues to such a phenomenon. Firstly, the co-variation pattern of exon-intron in their GC content, length and divergence suggests that the basic variation patterns are caused by factor(s) common to either exons or introns or to both. Given that there are common factors, they are likely to affect exons and functional elements of introns because of their importance. Therefore, the functional association between exon and intron, e.g., the splicing elements, may be the basis of co-variation patterns. Secondly, the monotonic reduction of length, GC content and divergence as the ordinal variation or as the total number increase in introns or exons indicates that this pattern may be the key to decipher the major factors which shape these patterns. The decay-like curves for these orderly reductions suggest that the ordinal patterns may be a reflection of time-related order (e.g., the longer or the more divergent introns occurred earlier). Thirdly, the first and the last exons are generally the longest exons in a gene, indicating the necessity of maintaining a larger exon in the beginning and in the end of a coding sequence. The selectively maintained first and last larger exons may be transcription-, splicing- or translation-required. Finally, the first intron generally has the highest GC content and thereafter there is almost no regular ordinal-pattern, which suggests that the first intron may evolve differently from the other introns.</p><p>In fact, the enrichment of regulatory elements in the first intron was most often used to explain the evolutionary pattern of the intron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. For example, the first intron was shown to enhance gene expression more than any others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. If the first intron is enriched with regulatory elements, they should thus contain more GC nucleotides, consistent with the higher GC content observed in most of genomes analyzed. However, the possible enrichment of regulatory elements in the first intron alone cannot explain the basic patterns in exon-intron variation as well as co-variation patterns between exons and introns.</p><p>The exon-intron architecture was also revealed to be important in the determination of splicing phenotype, and the efficient recognition of exons was influenced by the length of flanking introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The splice sites are recognized across the exons when intron size is greater than 200 to 250 nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The intron size has a profound influence on the likelihood that an exon is constitutively or alternatively spliced. Exon skipping is more likely to occur when exons are flanked by long introns in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Intron and exon lengths within a genome can reflect the constraints imposed by splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Many other factors may also contribute to the intron evolution, such as the density of transposable elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the attendance of RNA genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or miRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and the frequency and size of insertion/deletion events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Similar to the hypothesis of enrichment of regulatory elements in the first introns, however, these factors also cannot be used to explain either the ordinal or co-variation pattern in both exons and introns. Marais <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] suggested that genes with more slowly evolving exon sequences might also have more regulatory elements in introns. In this hypothesis, a co-variation pattern of exon-introns is expected but the strong ordinal reduction is not anticipated.</p><p>Obviously, the ordinal (or orderly) reduction patterns of exon-intron architecture constitute an important puzzle with theories about the determinants of genome evolution. The ordinal patterns may reflect a time-orderly evolution. If the amount of exons or introns follows an increasing trend (during the process of genome-size expansion), the first exon and intron are older than the next ones; the older introns have more time to be inserted and become longer; the inserted sequences in introns generally have a lower GC content; and the later occurring introns cut the coding sequences into shorter ones except for the first and the last exon, which are required by splicing-related factors; the subsequent recruited exons (or parts of them), compared with the first exons, have a higher possibility of coming from intron sequences and therefore have a lower GC content. The timely-ordered model could describe the consistent decrease of length, GC content and divergence observed in this study.</p><p>Some expectations could be tested by comparing the side (the first or the last) and the inner exons. Based on the UniProt database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], the proportion of the alternative spliced human exons in the total number of exons could be calculated separately for the genes with 3, 4... 9, and &#x0003e; 9-exons, respectively. Then we could compare the proportions of the first exon, the last exon and the others between them. Our calculation showed that the first (3.31%) and the last exon (5.98%) had a higher proportion than 2.33% in the others, indicating that the first and the last exon tend to be spliced alternatively, which might contribute to their unique lengths or GC contents.</p><p>The exon-increase model involves more in the variation of existed exons/introns, e.g., their length, divergence and GC content, but less in their gain and loss. Under this model, the preferential gain of introns in 3'-portions of genes is expected. This is more consistent with the introns-late hypothesis, in which the introns appeared later and at random in early eukaryotic genomes, and gained an adaptive role in gene evolution following insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Sverdlov and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] compared the distributions of old and new introns along the length of eukaryotic genes and showed that old introns were substantially overrepresented in the 5'-portions of the genes in all sequenced eukaryotic genomes, while new introns were over-distributed in the 3'-regions of the genes in the most intron-rich genomes. These results could be interpreted as an indication that the introns in the 3'-regions of genes might be younger. Similar to intron late or early hypothesis, however, this model cannot explain why the number of exons or introns increased in some genes or genomes but not in the others, neither does it define the outcome of this process. Many fundamental questions remain to be addressed in further studies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We showed that there were three basic patterns of exon-intron variation in eukaryotic genomes, and these patterns were consistently present in almost all 13 genomes analyzed. The first pattern is the ordinal reduction of length and divergence in both exons and introns. The decay-curve-like variation and the orderly reduction suggest that this pattern may reflect a time-sequential evolution (e.g., the earlier-occurred introns or exons were longer or more divergent). The second pattern is the co-variation of length, GC content and divergence between exons and flanking introns. The closely-correlated co-variation between exons and introns indicates common factor(s) exist in shaping both exons and introns. The third pattern is the decrease of average length, GC content and divergence in exons and introns as the total number of exons in a gene increased. This phenomenon may also be a reflection of chronological variation. In addition, a significant non-linear correlation was observed between GC content and the length of introns or exons. All these patterns of exon-intron variation revealed by our investigation provide a framework for elucidating mechanisms involved in the organization of eukaryotic genomes and particularly in building exon-intron structures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Genome sequences</title><p>Thirteen full sequenced genomes were selected (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), including Human (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>), chimpanzee (<italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>), mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), rat (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>), Cow (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>), dog (<italic>Canis familiaris</italic>), chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>), zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), pufferfish (<italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>), fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>), worm (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>), <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>and rice (<italic>Oryza Sativa</italic>).

Then another trait (y axis) was calculated for each of these bins and plotted against the first trait. For example, when examining the relationship between intron length and GC content, all introns in a genome were first sorted either by length or GC content into bins, then the average of GC content or length of every bin was calculated for each bin and plotted against length or GC content in figures. Only those introns within coding sequences and exons without UTR (untranslated regions) were used for analyses in all figures. In addition, the short introns (&#x0003c; 20 bp) were excluded to avoid systematic errors, which were reported in the introns by using automated annotation methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence alignment and divergence calculation</title><p>The pairwise alignments between human and chimpanzee were downloaded directly from UCSC Genome Browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].
