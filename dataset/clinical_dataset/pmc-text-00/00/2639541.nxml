It was identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene based on the presence of gene deletion or inactivating mutations in human brain, breast, and prostate cancers and tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. PTEN protein can be inactivated by post-transcriptional gene silencing, post-transcriptional modifications and GpG island methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) gene locates in the downstream of PI3K/Akt signal pathway, encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase which is considered as an oncoprotein. Studies showed that PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK and FAK signaling pathways and their downstream partners were activated in leukemia, inducing the decontrolled proliferation and enhancing the invasiveness of leukemia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>PTEN inhibits the activation of the above mentioned pathways via its lipid phosphatase and protein phosphatase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Rapamycin (RAPA), a triene macrolide antibiotic, has anti-mTOR activity by binding mTOR to interfere the interaction of mTOR with other target proteins in the signaling pathway. Targeting mTOR signaling pathway can be a new strategy for the treatment of leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Several studies showed that down-regulation of PTEN mRNA expression and protein synthesis, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways were activated in the bcr/abl fusion protein positive K562 cells. However, the relationship between the high expression of PTEN and the inactivation of mTOR signal pathway and their effects on the proliferation of K562 cells were not clear. The present study was designed to transfect K562 cells with recombined adenovirus-PTEN vector containing green fluorescent protein (Ad-PTEN-GFP) or Ad-GFP vector followed by the treatment of the cells with or without rapamycin. The regulatory mechanism of PTEN and rapamycin on mTOR signaling pathway in K562 cells was then explored and the growth inhibition effect of this treatment on K562 cell was analyzed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Main reagents</title><p>Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Qiangen Biotechnology (Qiangen, Beijing).

PTEN protein has protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase dual activity, and has the activity against phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5- trisphosphate (PIP3), the major bioactive product of PI3-kinase. The reduction of PIP3 level suppresses the activation of Akt and allows apoptosis to occur. Homozygous PTEN deletion is embryonic lethal in mice and PTEN<sup>+/- </sup>heterozygote mice may develop multiple tumors or immune system abnormalities. The inactivation of PTEN in leukemia can be induced by gene silencing, DNA methylation, transcriptional regulation or post-transcriptional modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Our results showed that PTEN mNRA and protein expressed at very low level in K562 cells, a cell line established from a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient in blast crisis. The over-expression of wild-type PTEN protein after PTEN gene transfection showed an anti-proliferation and apoptosis induction effect in the K562 cells in a time-dependent manner, indicating that the wild type PTEN might have anti-leukemia effect. Although previous studies showed that a close correlation was found between the low expression of PTEN and the poor prognosis in some tumor patients including hematological malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the loss of PTEN gene disturbed the maintenance of quiescent HSCs and promoted leukemogenesis in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the exact mechanism of hypo-expression of PTEN in human leukemogenesis was not clear.</p><p>The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase, a downstream partner in PI3K/Akt pathway, which regulates protein translation, cell growth and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Abnormalities in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway occurs in many solid or hematological malignancies. The present study also showed that mTOR mRNA and p-Akt protein expressed at high levels in K562 cells. After the cells were transfected with PTEN gene and treated with rapamycin, the expression levels of mTOR mRNA and p-Akt protein decreased accordingly. This result demonstrated that deregulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway might contribute to the development of leukemia, and could be considered as a candidate target for the treatment of leukemia.</p><p>Rapamycin can stabilize the inhibitors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and down-regulate the activity of mTOR. Studies showed that inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin decreased the phosphorylation of proteins in mTOR signaling pathway, induced cell cycle arrest at G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase and distinctly rescued the differentiation of normal hematolpoietic stem cells (HSCs) and depleted leukemic stem cells. The regulation of HSCs and leukemic cells might be governed by cell-context-dependent, PTEN-mediated inhibition of mTOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The cell cycle arrest associated with the down-regulation of cyclinD1 and up-regulation of the cdk inhibitors p27<sup>kip1 </sup>and p21<sup>cip1 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, inhibition of mTOR function represents a potential therapeutic strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our results showed that in the PTEN gene transfected K562 cells, over-expressed PTEN gene combined with the treatment of rapamycin significantly promoted the expression of P27<sup>kip1 </sup>gene but inhibited the expression of the CyclinD1. Meanwhile, the percentage of cells in S and G<sub>2</sub>/M phase decreased and the cells in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1 </sub>phase increased in the PTEN gene transfected K562 cells. These results suggested that PTEN gene and protein might inhibit the expression and the function of cyclins and cyclins-CDK but promote expression of P27<sup>kip1 </sup>via down-regulating p-Akt and mTOR expression.</p><p>Several published papers showed that rapamycin played key role in inhibiting tumor proliferation by targeting mTOR and had synergistic anti-tumors effects with some chemotherapeutic drugs such as arsenic trioxide in several kinds of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The present study showed that PTEN gene transfection, together with the treatment of low concentration of rapamycin, had a higher growth inhibition effect and apoptosis induction effect in K562 cell, accompanied with the increased expression of PTEN mRNA and protein but decreased expression of mTOR, suggesting that rapamycin and PTEN might have synergic effect on inhibiting proliferation, promoting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of leukemia cells via inhibiting the activity of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. These results might provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of CML with new molecule targeting regimens such as PTEN transfection and the use of rapamycin.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SYW and HC participated in the measurement of the target proteins by western blotting.
