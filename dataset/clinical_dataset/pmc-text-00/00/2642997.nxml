These forests contain numerous wild relatives of native South American crops, such as peach palm.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Our prospecting expeditions examined critical areas for wild peach palm in the Arc of Fire in Mato Grosso, Par&#x000e1;, Maranh&#x000e3;o and Tocantins, as well as areas not previously examined in Amazonas and Amap&#x000e1; states. Recent digitization of the RADAM Brasil project permitted comparison among RADAM's parataxonomists' observations, previous botanical collections and our prospecting. Mapping on soils and vegetation types enabled us to hypothesize a set of ecological preferences. Wild peach palm is best adapted to Ultisols (Acrisols) in open forests across the Arc of Fire and westward into the more humid western Amazonia. Populations are generally small (fewer than 10 plants) on slopes above watercourses. In northern Mato Grosso and southern Par&#x000e1; soybean fields and pastures now occupy numerous areas where RADAM identified wild peach palm. The controversial BR-163 Highway is already eroding wild peach palm as deforestation expands.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Many of these populations are now isolated by increasing forest fragmentation, which will lead to decreased reproduction via inbreeding depression and eventual extinction even without complete deforestation. Federal conservation areas are less numerous in the Arc of Fire than in other parts of Brazilian Amazonia, although there are indigenous lands; these conservation areas contain viable populations of wild peach palm and require better protection than they are currently receiving. <italic>Ex situ</italic> conservation of these populations is not viable given the relative lack of importance of domesticated peach palm and the difficulty of maintaining even economically interesting genetic resources.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The expansion of the agricultural frontier across southern Amazonia is a well-known phenomenon, with yearly reports on the rate of deforestation and the approximate number of square kilometers cleared and burned to make way for agriculture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-Fearnside1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Five prospecting expeditions were carried out in 2005 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004564-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The first expedition (March 2005) concentrated on the Madeira River, the connection between the hypothesized origin of peach palm as a domesticate and the major population centers of pre-Columbian Amazonia on the Amazon River <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-Piperno1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The second expedition (April 2005) concentrated on the Arc of Fire, from central Mato Grosso through southeastern Par&#x000e1; to western Maranh&#x000e3;o. The third expedition (April 2005) concentrated on northeastern Par&#x000e1; State to identify the eastern limits of var. <italic>chichagui</italic> type 1. The fourth expedition (May 2005) concentrated on the extreme northeast of Amazonia, the state of Amap&#x000e1;, to try to identify possible wild populations. The final expedition (May 2005) concentrated on the BR-163 that cuts south through central Amazonia from Santar&#x000e9;m, Par&#x000e1;, to Cuiab&#x000e1;, Mato Grosso, in order to attempt to identify the northern limit of the var. <italic>chichagui</italic> type 1 populations found across the Arc of Fire.</p><p>The first expedition traveled by plane, stopping at each municipal seat, where the two-man team interviewed people at town markets and the local extension agency about wild peach palm. When wild peach palm was reported, it was confirmed with visits to see plants. The other expeditions traveled by plane to target areas and then by car along major and secondary highways. At each urban center, the two-man teams interviewed people at town markets and the local extension agency; in Alta Floresta, the team interviewed people at the CEPLAC (National Cacau Promotion Commission) station as well. Between urban centers, the teams observed the landscape and stopped at candidate areas for wild peach palm, both primary forest (principally in Mato Grosso) and secondary forest; when found, plants and fruit bunches were photographed. The teams avoided entering private land unless wild peach palm was observed, in which case permission was obtained to photograph. All wild peach palm was geo-referenced (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004564.s001">Appendix S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The RADAM dataset</title><p>The RADAM Project started in 1970 and in 1975 was expanded to cover the rest of Brazil outside of Amazonia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-RADAM1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. With the digitization of this data set by IBGE, it became possible to easily transfer information into geographic information systems to compare the extensive RADAM data set with others, such as the ProBio-financed peach palm data set. This comparison is both enlightening and somewhat frustrating because peach palm was not considered a major economic species by RADAM.</p><p>The 3,131 ground surveys included a soils characterization pit and a rapid survey of the vegetation along a transect near the pit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-RADAM1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Wild and sometimes cultivated peach palm is included.</p><p>We use the soils and vegetation characterizations to identify apparent adaptations of var. <italic>chichagui</italic> across the Arc of Fire. Given that there are only 3,131 ground surveys in the 5 million square kilometer Brazilian Amazon basin, precision identification of soils and vegetation types is only possible for the RADAM data records and even these may not be precise given local environmental heterogeneity within the area of the botanical survey. We feel that the vegetation types are generally more reliable than the soils, but by examining soils at the class level rather than the great group level we expect greater reliability. Nonetheless, it is clear that this is only a first approximation and further work is necessary to refine our interpretation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>The ProBio expeditions for wild peach palm</title><p>The first expedition proceeded along the Madeira River, Amazonas, from Borba south to Porto Velho, Rond&#x000f4;nia. Throughout the Madeira basin the Par&#x000e1; landrace of cultivated peach palm is common, confirming Mora Urp&#x000ed;'s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-MoraUrp2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> hypothesis that the Madeira River connects the Par&#x000e1; landrace with the possible origin of the domesticate in SW Amazonia. In Borba, there is a large plantation of exotic peach palm (spineless germplasm from the Pampa Hermosa landrace, around Yurimaguas, Peru, is used in the heart-of-palm agribusiness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-MoraUrp1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>), and some has been managed for seed production. Consequently, exotic fruit are also coming into the market, but do not attract local consumers, who think these fruit are too starchy compared to their oilier Par&#x000e1; landrace fruit. At Manicor&#x000e9; the team was informed that wild peach palm occurred 50&#x02013;60 km south of town, but they were unable to confirm this. In Porto Velho, the team found type 3 <italic>chichagui</italic>, with fruit weighing 5&#x02013;6 g. Similar fruits were found at Humait&#x000e1;, Amazonas.

The whole region has been dramatically altered since Barbosa Rodrigues' visit, with pastures and second growth vegetation predominating in and around the Chapada. The approximate type locality is also partially occupied by the inundation area of the Manso River hydroelectric dam. Without finding Barbosa Rodrigues' <italic>G. mattogrossensis</italic>, the team flew north to Alta Floresta in the epicenter of current deforestation in Mato Grosso's rapidly expanding agricultural frontier. The trip north went over significantly altered landscapes, with pasture and field crops, principally soybean, alternating with second growth. Around Alta Floresta the amount of fragmented forest was significant, with land use change evident on all sides.

The team returned north and went to Imperatriz, Maranh&#x000e3;o, and then south through the Cerrado into northern Tocantins, without observing wild peach palm in gallery forests. The cultivated peach palm that was observed was reported to have been recently introduced from Bel&#x000e9;m, Par&#x000e1;.

In Oiapoque, close to the frontier with French Guiana, a single plant, with a thinner stem, smaller leaves and small fruit bunches was found, but the bunch was dry and no seeds were found on the ground. Neighbors claimed that the fruit is so small that it cannot be sold, but this is not enough to claim to have found wild peach palm in Amap&#x000e1;.

Laurance et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-Laurance1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> examined the mid-term impact of this road within the previous government's development plan, which stimulated the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment to establish numerous conservation units along this highway in 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-MMA1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. While it looks good on paper, it remains to be seen whether these areas will survive the agricultural expansion now at full throttle in the region.</p><p>This raises the issue of <italic>ex situ</italic> conservation, especially as peach palm is increasingly important for its heart-of-palm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-MoraUrp1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The outlook for this type of conservation is not favorable, however, as numerous <italic>ex situ</italic> collections of peach palm have lost their funding because they have not presented favorable cost/benefit ratios, others are under-funded and some have been abandoned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-Clement8">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-vanLeeuwen1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. At first glance, this is curious, given the expansion of the hearts-of-palm agribusiness in Latin America. The reasons are clear, however: the hearts-of-palm expansion depends upon genetic resources from a single landrace, the Pampa Hermosa near Yurimaguas, Peru <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-MoraUrp1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-Clement9">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>; the major collections contain numerous landraces with no commercial demand, as well as some samples of wild peach palm, hence agribusiness is uninterested in supporting them because they are not directly pertinent &#x02013; in fact, at this early stage in the expansion, no agribusiness is willing to support conservation. Hence, the idea of conservation-through-use that is central to the Convention on Biological Diversity is not applicable to peach palm <italic>ex situ</italic> collections at this stage of its economic expansion.</p><p>For a tree species, like peach palm, it is now appropriate to include climate change in analyses for conservation, since significant change is expected within the 30 to 100 year life span of a clump of peach palm. In Amazonia, where El Ni&#x000f1;o events are important, the Hadley Centre model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-Cox1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> is considered to be the most appropriate for planning. This model predicts savannaization in eastern Amazonia before mid-century, with subsequent expansion westward until all forest is savanna by 2080. The principal implication is that even large SNUC areas and Indigenous Lands will become fragmented and savannaized.</p><p>Using a less severe Hadley Centre model, Miles et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-Miles1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref> predict that only 20 to 30&#x00025; of a set of 69 angiosperm species with variable distributions in Amazonia will have viable populations across southern Amazonia at the end of the century in a business-as-usual scenario, while 60 to 70&#x00025; may have viable populations if human society works hard to reduce carbon emissions immediately. Wild peanut species across the savannas south of Amazonia are also expected to suffer, with as many as 31 of 51 species going extinct in a business-as-usual scenario <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004564-Jarvis1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. No other studies have included native Amazonian crops and their wild relatives to date, but we can predict that survival of other wild relatives of native South American crops found in the Arc of Fire will depend upon their ability to survive in savannas or in gallery forests, ecosystems in which we failed to find wild peach palm.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004564.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>Full data set developed and used in project.
