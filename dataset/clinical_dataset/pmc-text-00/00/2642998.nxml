It is commonly recognized that to overcome resistance and improve outcome, treatment should be guided by tumor biology, which includes genotype, epigenotype, and gene expression profile. We therefore took an integrative approach to better understand melanoma cell response to clinically relevant dose of decitabine and identify complementary targets for combined therapy. We employed eight different melanoma cell strains, determined their growth, apoptotic and DNA damage responses to increasing doses of decitabine, and chose a low, clinically relevant drug dose to perform whole-genome differential gene expression, bioinformatic analysis, and protein validation studies. The data ruled out the DNA damage response, demonstrated the involvement of p21<sup>Cip1</sup> in a p53-independent manner, identified the TGF&#x003b2; pathway genes <italic>CLU</italic> and <italic>TGFBI</italic> as markers of sensitivity to decitabine and revealed an effect on histone modification as part of decitabine-induced gene expression. Mutation analysis and knockdown by siRNA implicated activated &#x003b2;-catenin/MITF, but not BRAF, NRAS or PTEN mutations as a source for resistance. The importance of protein stability predicted from the results was validated by the synergistic effect of Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, in enhancing the growth arrest of decitabine in otherwise resistant melanoma cells. Our integrative analysis show that improved therapy can be achieved by comprehensive analysis of cancer cells, identified biomarkers for patient's selection and monitoring response, as well as targets for improved combination therapy.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is growing evidence that tumors are highly heterogeneous and that treatment guided by tumor genotype, epigenotype, and gene expression profile may improve outcome.

Nevertheless, mutation analysis is already a part of clinical operating procedures, such as in selecting patients for treatment with PLX4032 (Plexxikon Inc.) and Imatinib (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals), inhibitors specific for activated BRAF and KIT, respectively.</p><p>Epigenomic dysregulation, such as methylation of DNA at CpG rich islands in promoter regions and histone-tail modifications are common in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Baylin1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Feinberg2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> as well as in melanomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Hoon1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

For example, the well-characterized DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine (5-Aza-2&#x02032;-deoxy-cytidine, Aza), is active as a single agent in myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and has also been in clinical trials for solid tumors, such as melanomas, but with disappointing results. There are probably multiple factors behind lack of responsiveness, among them the instability of the drug, failure to achieve optimal concentration, or failure to exert the intended activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Jabbour1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Aza can sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Shang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and immunotherapeutic drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Reu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Borden1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, and combination therapy with existing or novel DNA demethylating agents can become more efficient in treating solid tumors.</p><p>Consequently, there is a need for a better understanding of the molecular effects of clinically relevant concentrations of decitabine, and to identify markers that predict tumor sensitivity and/or can be used to monitor drug efficacy. In the studies described here we explored the mechanism of action of low-dose decitabine on melanoma cells that are relatively sensitive or resistance to this drug, assessed global gene expression, conducted extensive bioinformatic analysis for biomarker discovery, investigated the contribution of somatic mutations to decitabine resistance, validated some of the changes at the protein level, performed functional analyses, and explored synergistic treatment based on susceptibility of key proteins to proteasomal degradation. We demonstrate that the growth inhibitory effects of low-dose decitabine cannot be attributed to DNA damage response but rather to reconstitution of growth suppressive pathways; activating mutation in &#x003b2;-catenin can confer resistance; and Bortezomib can re-sensitize resistant cells to decitabine.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell proliferation and apoptotic responses to Aza</title><p>Aza dose-response analyses revealed that five of the melanoma cell strains (YUMAC, YUSAC2, YULAC, YUSIT1, and YUGEN8) were relatively sensitive to the drug with IC50 ranging between 13&#x02013;135 nM, and the other three (WW165, YURIF and 501 mel) were relatively resistant with IC50 ranging between 233&#x02013;417 nM as determined by cell proliferation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004563-g001"><bold>Figure 1A, B</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004563.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004563.s005">Table S1</xref></bold>).

Nor were BRAF, N-Ras activation or PTEN mutation/loss responsible for the differences, because all cell strains expressed the activated BRAF kinase, none harbored N-Ras mutation, and PTEN expression was lost in only two cell strains, while one PTEN-positive cell strain carry a known variant (Pro38Ser) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004563-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).

The data implicated three major components in Aza responsiveness: a) activation of Wnt signaling; b) re-expression of p21<sup>Cip1</sup> in a p53-independent manner and c) activation of two TGF&#x003b2; pathway genes.</p><p>Comparing the gene expression profile of un-treated and treated melanoma cells implicated Wnt signaling based on high expression of the Wnt antagonist SFRP1 only in sensitive cells, which led us to further explore downstream members of this pathway and to identify activated &#x003b2;-catenin as a feature contributing to drug resistance. Although mutations in <italic>CTNNB1</italic> are rare in melanomas, activation might be through upstream modulators because a survey of large collection of melanoma tumors in tissue microarrays demonstrated that activated &#x003b2;-catenin in the nucleus is an independent predictor of poor survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Kielhorn1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

We showed that the likely effect of activated &#x003b2;-catenin is upregulation of MITF, a potent melanocyte-specific transcription factor by itself considered an oncogene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Levy1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly only two of the three resistant cell strains, 501 mel and YURIF, harbored activated <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutation. The third one, WW165 expressed constitutively high levels of endogenous MITF (in the absence of any gene amplification). Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway also interferes with responsiveness of CML to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Giles1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting a common effect on other cancer cells as well. Therefore, various components of the activated Wnt/&#x003b2; pathway, in particular an activating mutation in &#x003b2;-catenin and high levels of MITF could be considered when selecting patients for this type of therapy, and devising combination therapy.</p><p>Protein analysis showed that p21<sup>Cip1</sup> was upregulated in a p53 independent manner in two of the sensitive cell strains, but not in a resistant one. However, p21<sup>Cip1</sup> was relatively stable and abundant in the other five melanoma cell strains, suggesting the emergence of resistance downstream of this cell cycle suppressor.</p><p>Whole genome expression analysis uncovered two reactivated TGF&#x003b2;-responsive genes Clusterin and TGFBI that were more prominent in Aza-sensitive compared to resistant melanoma cells, and their activation enhanced apoptosis as observed by siRNA mediated gene knockdown. These two proteins can be used as markers, because they are secreted and have the potential to be released into the circulation. Furthermore, TGFBI promoter methylation might be useful as a marker for malignant transformation because it was unmethylated in normal melanocytes and hypo- or fully methylated in freshly isolated primary and metastatic melanoma cells, as well as melanoma tumors.</p><p>Our global gene expression analysis uncovered a total of 292 differentially expressed genes (mostly re-expression) across all melanoma strains after Aza treatment, with some products known to be associated with growth arrest. In addition to those described here, we validated the expression of UCHL1, PTPN6, TNFR1, SELENBP1, TNFR1, TNFRSF10D, S100A4, and several MAGE genes by semi-quantitative or real-time RT-PCR, or Western blots. Some of them, such as PTPN6 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 6), that is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, were significantly induced at the protein level in the Aza sensitive YUMAC and YUSAC cells, but very little in the other cell types without any correlation to growth arrest or apoptotic response (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004563.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>).

Other decitabine-responsive genes in our dataset, such as FN1, UCHL1, FUCA1, ICAM1, IL8, SERPINE2, TMEM45A and SFRP2 are also reactivated by HDAC inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Hellebrekers1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Sova1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, and might be modulated through histone modification by Aza as well. Aza can directly and indirectly modify histones as a function of DNMT status. DNMT1 interacts with HDAC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Fuks1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref> and elimination of DNMT1 displaces HDAC1 from target promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Scott1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, Aza can affect histone methylation because DNMT1 binds also SUV39H1, a H3K9 methyltransferase, and EZH2 that catalyses the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27), conferring a suppressive state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Vire1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

Taken altogether, the observations reinforce the concept that impact on histone modification should be considered when dissecting the function of decitabine and devising combination therapy that is based on gene reactivation.</p><p>The protein validation data highlighted the importance of proteasomal degradation processes in responsiveness to Aza. At least two of the critical growth suppressor proteins, p21<sup>Cip1</sup> and Clusterin, undergo proteasomal degradation. This observation led us to infer that a proteasomal inhibitor such as Bortezomib, currently in clinical trials, can synergize with low-dose Aza to alleviate resistance. This prediction was fulfilled in the case of 501 mel resistant cells. The synergistic response to this drug combination was unique because the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG and the IGF1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 (Novartis), employed at log-range of concentrations, did not show any synergistic growth arrest with Aza (data not shown).</p><p>Altogether, our results from this limited panel of melanoma cells suggest that treatment of melanoma patients could be improved by knowledge of the genetic and epigenetic background of individual tumors. In addition, they implicate that proteasomal and HDAC inhibitors might act in synergy with epigenetic modifiers for some patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells, drug treatments and proliferation assays</title><p>Normal human melanocytes were isolated from newborn foreskins and grown in OptiMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with antibiotics, 5&#x00025; fetal calf serum (regular medium) and growth supplements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004563-Cheng1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> and used during their first passage.

Cells were harvested, re-suspended in PBS at 125,000 cells/ml and 50 &#x000b5;l portions were processed, subjected to electrophoreses and stained with SYBR Green I. Single fluorescing cells (100&#x02013;120 cells from each treatment) were photographed, and analyzed with CASP software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://casp.sourceforge.net">http://casp.sourceforge.net</ext-link>). Quantitative and statistical data were generated by analysis of the results using the commercially available image analysis software packages that calculates tail length and tail moment termed CASP software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://casp.sourceforge.net">http://casp.sourceforge.net</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>RNA isolation and hybridization to DNA microarrays</title><p>Approximately 20&#x02013;30 million cells (normal human melanocytes and melanoma cells/each) were used for mRNA extraction. The melanoma cells were treated with low-dose Aza (0.2 &#x000b5;M) for 2 days, followed by one day recovery, total RNA was extracted with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc., Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), and Poly(A) mRNA was further isolated using the PolyATtract mRNA isolation system IV (Pro-mega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions, and reversed transcribed to double stranded cDNA.</p><p>NimbleGen human whole genome expression microarrays (array 2005-04-20_Human_60mer_1in2) were used for hybridization. The same chip was hybridized with Cy3/Cy5 labeled polyA-selected cDNA from untreated and Aza treated melanoma cells. Each hybridization was repeated with dye swapping. The array hybridizations and data captures were performed by personnel at NimbleGen Systems Iceland LLC. V&#x000ed;nlandslei&#x000f0; 2&#x02013;4, 113 Reykjavik, Iceland (currently Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Bioinformatic analysis of global gene expression</title><sec id="s4e1"><title>Microarray design and data pre-processing</title><p>The NimbleGen oligonucleotide microarrays contain &#x0223c;380,000 probes with an average of 11 probes per sequence id. The entire set of sequence ids can be associated with &#x0223c;19,000 known genes. Normalization within arrays was performed with Loess-based methods to correct for biases due to labeling with different dyes on the two microarray channels. As such, M and A values were determined where M describes the amount of differential expression (M&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;log2(cy5/cy3)) and A associates M with the magnitude of overall expression (A&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;(log2cy5&#x0002b;log2cy3)/2). Normalization between arrays was performed via quantile-based methods to derive comparable A values (i.e., the average probe-signal). The steps of normalization within- and between-array were accomplished with tools provided in the <italic>limma</italic> Bioconductor library (8).</p></sec><sec id="s4e2"><title>Selection of differentially expressed genes</title><p>A probe-level moderated <italic>t</italic>-statistic and the corresponding p-value were calculated via the limma library (9). In particular, an empirical Bayes method was employed to moderate the standard errors of the estimated log-fold changes, resulting in more stable inference and improved power (9). Multiple testing issues have been taken into account when determining the cutoff p-values. Next, we mapped probes to sequences by initially establishing a sequence's p-value distribution, and subsequently performing a <italic>t</italic>-test to determine whether this distribution was likely to have a mean of 1e-4 at an alpha level of 0.05. In effect, we are testing whether most of the probes had p-values below this threshold. Sequences that were significant, and whose probes were concordant in sign (i.e., no more than three discordant probes per sequence id) were retained. This pipeline was applied to identify differentially expressed genes after the Aza treatment (292 genes); and differentially expressed genes in untreated Aza resistant and sensitive cells (94 genes). WW165, 501 mel and YURIF were considered as the resistant, and the other five as sensitive strains for these analyses based on the IC50 values.</p></sec><sec id="s4e3"><title>Functional grouping of differentially expressed genes</title><p>Differentially expressed sequences were evaluated for enrichment of GeneOntology (GO) terms, considering all the three ontologies: Molecular Functions, Cellular Component and Biological Processes (Harris et al., 2004). GO terms were assigned to each sequence id based on its Entrez gene id. A statistical test based on the hypergeometric distribution was used to determine the significance of the enrichment of each term. The final sets of GO terms were ranked based on their p-value and the most significant (p-value&#x0003c;1e-3) were selected.</p></sec><sec id="s4e4"><title>Text mining</title><p>We performed text mining to better characterize genes that showed differential expression after Aza treatment. Specifically, we queried the literature for genes with known promoter hypermethylation in cancer, and for genes that have been shown to be regulated by treatment with epigenetic modifiers.
