GABA binds to an ionotropic, heteropentameric receptor (GABA type A receptor [GABAR]) and triggers the activation of an integral chloride channel. This generally results in membrane hyperpolarization via phasic and tonic inhibitory mechanisms leading to suppressed neuronal excitability. GABAR function is subunit dependent, and a wide variety of pharmacologically relevant compounds, including benzodiazepines, intravenous and volatile anesthetics, neurosteroids, and barbiturates, are thought to exert their effects on cellular excitability by altering GABAR activity (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Macdonald, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mehta and Ticku, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thompson and Wafford, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The barbiturate pentobarbital (PB) modulates GABARs in a complex fashion.

PB washout produces a paradoxical current rebound or &#x0201c;tail&#x0201d; reflecting PB unbinding from a site(s) that produces channel blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rho et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thompson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wooltorton et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serafini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krampfl et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Tail currents are clearly observed at concentrations exceeding 1,000 &#x003bc;M, which is higher than those that trigger channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rho et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serafini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krampfl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that a binding site(s) mediating block has lower affinity than that for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rho et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thompson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wooltorton et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalziel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krampfl et al., 2002</xref>). The concentration dependence of tail currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rho et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serafini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krampfl et al., 2002</xref>) and PB-triggered single-channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Akk and Steinbach, 2000a</xref>) suggest that blockade involves multiple binding sites, but the precise number remains an open question. Single-channel studies indicate the blocking mechanism involves open-channel block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Akk and Steinbach, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akk et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, tail current deactivation time course is slowed by increasing PB concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rho et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serafini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2004</xref>), and at high concentrations, it appears that it cannot be accounted for by multi-exponential functions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akk et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). This deviates from linear kinetic behavior expected under concentration clamp provided by rapid whole cell perfusion. As a result, the objectives of this study were to provide new insight into PB blockade of GABARs, specifically into the number of inhibitory binding sites and the gating underlying the complex modulation of tail current time course by PB.</p><p>To this end, we investigated recombinant &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b3;<sub>2S</sub> GABARs, thought to be present in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Whiting et al., 1999</xref>), in rapidly perfused, whole cell, and single-channel outside-out cell-free membrane patches. Early efforts in whole cells reproduced salient features of PB modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2004</xref>). We then explored single-channel gating in rapidly perfused outside-out membrane patches. We frequently encountered macroscopic patch currents with tails that manifested eightfold greater relative amplitude and 20-fold faster deactivation relative to whole cells, and that were insensitive to PB concentration and application time. Subsequently, we developed a parsimonious gating model reconciling micro- and macropatch results (patch model). We then considered simple mechanisms that may explain the divergence between whole cell and patch macroscopic currents. Barbiturates manifest low apparent transcellular permeability rates (&#x0223c;0.4 &#x003bc;m/sec) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Behrens et al., 2001</xref>), which may manifest pharmacokinetics (PKs) on a timescale of seconds in HEK-293 cells. This may cause the effective solution exchange of the unstirred layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maconochie and Knight, 1989</xref>), which bathes membrane-bound GABARs, to be unexpectedly slower than that of whole cell perfusion. We tested this hypothesis through the addition of a lipophilic PK compartment to the &#x0201c;patch&#x0201d; model, which allows it to account for all divergent features of whole cell tail currents.</p><p>The major findings of the study derived from macropatch currents include deactivation time course independent of PB concentration and application duration, GABA coapplication potentiation of PB blockade, and channel blockade that is mediated by at least three bindings sites where block is caused by PB concentrations sixfold lower than those for activation. Finally, the divergence in tail current features between whole cells and macropatches can be explained by PB entry into a proposed lipophilic, cellular, PK compartment. Overall, the results advance the understanding of the mechanism underlying PB blockade, point to a role of PB-blocked channels at therapeutic concentrations, previously thought unlikely, and question the effective rate of solution exchange during rapid perfusion of whole cells with PB and perhaps lipophilic agents in general.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell Culture and Transient Transfection</title><p>Transformed HEK-293 cells, purchased from American Type Culture Collection, were plated on 18 &#x000d7; 18&#x02013;mm glass coverslips in 60 &#x000d7; 15&#x02013;mm Falcon dishes (BD) and cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% each of penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine (all from Invitrogen). After incubation in 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 48 h, cells were transiently transfected using a lipofection technique described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gingrich et al., 1995</xref>) with cDNAs encoding rat brain &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, and &#x003b3;<sub>2S</sub> subunits inserted individually into the plasmid pCDM8 (Invitrogen). In brief, aliquots of lipofection reagent (Lipofectamine; Invitrogen) and appropriate plasmids (1:1:1 by weight, &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>/&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>/&#x003b3;<sub>2S</sub>) were mixed in a modified, serum-free medium (Opti-MEM; Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS (Invitrogen), and supplemented MEM was replaced with Opti-MEM, followed by the addition of liposome plasmid&#x02013;containing solution. After a 6&#x02013;8-h incubation period (37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), cells were washed with PBS and returned to supplemented MEM for further incubation. Cells were ready for electrophysiological recording 48 h after transfection.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiological Recordings</title><p>Coverslips with transfected cells were transferred to the lid of a culture dish mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (IMT-2; Olympus) with Hoffman-modulated optics. The cells were immersed in a modified Tyrode's solution containing (in mM): 135 NaCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES, NaOH, pH 7.2. Glass pipettes were prepared from borosilicate glass (Corning) with a multistage puller (Flaming Brown, model P-97; Sutter Instrument Co.) and fire polished (MF-9 Microforge; Narishige). For single-channel recordings, the pipettes were coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning Company). Pipettes were filled with (in mM): 135 CsCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES-KOH, 10 EGTA, pH 7.2. Open tip resistances were typically 2&#x02013;5 M&#x003a9; for whole cell recordings and 5&#x02013;10 M&#x003a9; for outside-out patch recordings under these ionic conditions. Currents were recorded with either the whole cell or outside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamill et al., 1981</xref>) using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon CNS; MDS Analytical Technologies). Macropatch currents were those recorded from outside-out membrane patches with sufficient channel number, such that measured currents reflected macroscopic gating. Macroscopic currents were filtered at 1&#x02013;2 kHz (&#x02212;3 dB, 4-pole Bessel) and sampled at 12.5 kHz. Single-channel currents were filtered at 2 kHz (&#x02212;3 dB, 4-pole Bessel) and sampled at 25 kHz. Digitized data were collected and stored on an IBM-compatible (Gateway 2000 4DX-2-66) computer running the Axobasic environment (MDS Analytical Technologies) using software of our own design. Data were collected at room temperature (20&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C). The chloride potential is 0 mV under these ionic conditions resulting in inward currents (outward Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> movement) at a holding potential of &#x02212;60 mV for whole cell recordings and &#x02212;70 mV for macropatch and single-channel recordings throughout our experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Rapid Solution Changes</title><p>PB (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared fresh daily and diluted to the desired concentrations in Tyrode's solution. Control and test solutions were delivered from syringes mounted on a syringe pump (whole cell experiments; Harvard) or gravity fed (macropatch and single-channel experiments) separately into the lumens of dual-barreled pipettes constructed from pulled borosilicate theta tubing (Sutter Instrument Co.). Pulse application (0.1&#x02013;10 s) of PB (10&#x02013;5,000 &#x003bc;M) was achieved by rapid solution changes (rise times: whole cell, &#x0003c;10 ms; patch, &#x0003c;1 ms) through a piezoelectric translator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gingrich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burkat et al., 2001</xref>). The application period was &#x0003e;30 s. Cells resided on coverslips during whole cell experiments. Outside-out membrane patches were raised to near the middle of the perfusion stream after patch excision. Test solutions containing PB were applied by delivering a filtered (model LPF-100B; 4-pole Bessel, 200 Hz; Warner Instrument Corporation) voltage pulse to a high-voltage amplifier (model P-275.10; Physik Instruments) that drove the macro-block translator, such that a dual-barreled pipette tip moved a short distance. For single-channel recordings, PB pulses were applied every 15 s. At experiment end, the membrane patch was ruptured and open tip junction potential current responses were obtained using half-diluted Tyrode's solution. This response was taken to represent the PB time course during the experiment. Experiments were included only if the time course approximated a pulse with 10&#x02013;90% rise time &#x0003c;300 &#x003bc;s. In preliminary experiments, the variability of the wash-in latency was &#x0003c;120 &#x003bc;s (SEM). This was reported by the time to reach the half-amplitude point of the junction potential response during repetitive pulsing when the wash-in criterion was satisfied.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Macroscopic currents during the application of PB and &#x0201c;rebound&#x0201d; currents upon PB washout were fit to multi-exponential functions using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (Origin v7.5; Originlab). The goodness of fit was evaluated by the &#x003c7;2 value, and adequacy of fit to multi-exponential functions was judged by eye. The number of fitted exponential components was increased until additional functions failed to improve the fit. Normalized concentration&#x02013;response relationships were fit with the logistic equation [<italic>V = A / (1</italic> + <italic>(x/x<sub>0</sub>)<sup>slope</sup>)</italic>], where <italic>V</italic> is the endpoint addressed, <italic>A</italic> is the maximum value of the fit to <italic>V, x</italic> is the PB concentration, <italic>x<sub>0</sub></italic> is related to the half-blocking concentration, and <italic>slope</italic> is a slope factor related to the Hill coefficient. Single-channel events were detected by half-height criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sachs et al., 1982</xref>) and idealized with custom software running in the Matlab v5.1 environment (Mathworks). The number of active channels in a patch (<italic>n</italic>) was determined by the stacking of unitary events, which is a good estimator, especially for <italic>n</italic> &#x02264; 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horn, 1991</xref>). The time-dependent probability (P) of the single-channel open state (O) is <italic>P(O)</italic>. Channel counting was performed at time point when <italic>P(O)</italic> reached a maximum (peak <italic>P(O)</italic>), which was taken at the washout of 3,000 &#x003bc;M PB. A typical patch contained two to four active channels. The primary conductance, <italic>n</italic>-channel patch ensemble current, and <italic>n</italic> were used to calculate the single-channel <italic>P(O)</italic> over time. The primary conductance was calculated using primary unitary current and an Ohmic relationship (chloride reversal potential = 0 mV; holding potential = &#x02212;70 mV). Dwell time histograms were fitted by a maximum likelihood method. Transformed probability density functions were fit to dwell time histograms by only considering durations greater than three times the system dead time (t<sub>d</sub> &#x02248; 0.1 ms). Shorter dwell durations were excluded from the analysis because the detection of these events is frequently missed due to the effects of system filtering and the use of a half-height criterion. Idealized records were used to construct ensemble currents. Data are presented as means &#x000b1; SEM. Statistical comparisons were performed in Origin v7.5, and significance was taken at P &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Model Simulation and Parameter Estimation</title><sec><title>Patch Model.</title><p>The nine-state Markov gating model was implemented in Matlab v7.5 (Mathworks) by solving the matrix equation:<disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="JGP_200810081_LW_Equ1.jpg"/></disp-formula>where <italic>X</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is a 9 &#x000d7; 1&#x02013;state variable vector indicating the occupation of the states (i.e., R, CL, CL<sub>2</sub>, O, BL<sub>3</sub>, BL<sub>4</sub>, BL<sub>5</sub>, D<sub>s</sub>, and D<sub>f</sub>) at time <italic>t</italic>, <italic>X</italic>(0) = [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] initial state vector at time 0 assuming all channels in the resting <italic>R</italic> state, and <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = the 9 &#x000d7; 9&#x02013;state transition matrix of rate constants governing the transition rates between all connected states. The single open state is <italic>O</italic>, the singly and doubly liganded receptors are <italic>CL</italic> and <italic>CL<sub>2</sub></italic>, respectively, two desensitized states are <italic>D<sub>s</sub></italic> and <italic>D<sub>f</sub></italic>, and three blocked states of <italic>BL<sub>3</sub></italic>, <italic>BL<sub>4</sub></italic>, and <italic>BL<sub>5</sub></italic> bind PB to one, two, and three inhibitory sites, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). The simulation period was divided into PB wash-in and wash-out, and changes in concentration at receptors occurred instantly. Parameter optimization used a least-squares technique (Matlab Optimization Toolbox 4.1; Mathworks) with a weighted error function and simultaneously fit a set of single-channel <italic>P(O)</italic>'s for 500 and 3,000 &#x003bc;M. <italic>P(O)</italic>'s were obtained by scaling mean macropatch currents, such that tail <italic>P(O)</italic>'s were equal to those of single channels. Early optimization resulted in parameter values that caused the model to poorly account for activation and early desensitization of the 3,000-&#x003bc;M response. As a result, errors arising from data points describing this portion of the response, up to &#x0223c;0.2 s, were weighted fivefold. This weighting strategy provided for a good fit to the entire target dataset and was used to determine the final set of optimal parameter values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PK Patch Model.</title><p>This model is the combination of the patch model and a three-compartment PK model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>).

Increasing PB concentrations up to 500 &#x003bc;M enhanced peak current amplitudes and accelerated desensitization. Further increases continued to accelerate desensitization but also depressed peak current and triggered the enhancement of current upon PB washout, the tail current. Notably, tail current relaxation (deactivation) slowed with increasing PB concentration in which current persisted for seconds after washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These observations were confirmed in group data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Current immediately before washout (plateau) was measured to determine the degree of current decay during the pulse. I<sub>PB</sub> increased in amplitude with increasing PB concentrations, reached a maximum at 500 &#x003bc;M PB, and subsequently declined in peak and plateau with PB concentrations &#x0003e;500 &#x003bc;M, thereby yielding bell-shaped concentration&#x02013;response relationships for both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), consistent with channel inhibition at higher concentrations. At concentrations of 500 &#x003bc;M and greater, PB washout also induced current &#x0201c;rebound&#x0201d; or tail current, suggesting relief of channel inhibition by the unbinding of PB from inhibitory sites. The slope of the peak current concentration&#x02013;response relationship at low concentrations provides a lower limit on the number of agonist bindings sites that must be occupied to trigger channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katz and Thesleff, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colquhoun and Ogden, 1988</xref>). Peak current responses at low PB concentrations indicate that at least two binding sites are involved in channel activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, right). Normalized tail current enhancement showed a sigmoidal dependence on PB concentration in which maximal amplitudes were similar to those for peak current during the pulse.

Consequently, when the concentration is &#x0201c;jumped&#x0201d; to a new value, the state trajectory of a channel involving <italic>n</italic> states can be described by a system of <italic>n</italic>-l exponential functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen, 1998</xref>). Both microscopic rates and initial state conditions determine coefficients, whereas time constants are determined exclusively by the former. The channel moves to a new state owing to the change in microscopic rates affected by the jump where the microscopic rates remain constant until another jump occurs. This presumes that the time course of the perturbing concentration jump is fast relative to rates of the fundamental exponential equations. Therefore, the time course of any variable after a jump is described by a sum of exponential functions with constant rates and coefficients. Time invariance adds the additional constraint that system rate constants remain unchanged over the period of interest. The current time course during washout at low concentrations (250 &#x003bc;M) can be described by a sum of exponentials based on semilogarthmic plotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, left) and successful multi-exponential fitting (not depicted), consistent with a linear and time-invariant system.

We assumed that tail amplitude reflects the degree of channel blockade during the PB application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serafini et al., 2000</xref>), and therefore the tail concentration&#x02013;response relationships provide insight into the dependence of block on PB concentration. The relationship is well fit by a logistic equation with a slope factor of 2.23, suggesting the involvement of at least three binding sites in channel blockade. However, this relationship is also influenced by PB binding to sites involved in activation as well as other unrelated conformational changes. Therefore, we sought another endpoint that more selectively reflects inhibitory binding.</p><p>Open channels undergo direct blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), so an endpoint reporting the relative proportions of blocked and open channels would provide focused insight into PB binding underlying block. The tail current magnitude is the sum of the plateau, representing open unblocked channels before washout, plus the rapid current upstroke produced by washout and subsequent channel unblock. The upstroke magnitude reports the number of blocked channels and is the difference between tail and plateau current amplitudes. This endpoint may underestimate the number of blocked channels because channels may deactivate or desensitize before unblocking. However, these effects seem minor given that the rate of unblocking (&#x0223c;500 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) is more than an order of magnitude faster than that of the fastest component of deactivation (&#x0223c;30 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and apparent desensitization (&#x0223c;10 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

As a result, this preparation is expected to accurately report channel responses. Therefore, we used macropatch as well as single-channel data in model development. We wished to develop a parsimonious gating model that could account for our macropatch observations to understand how differing processes (binding, activation, desensitization, and blockade) may interact to account for channel activity. Such a model could then serve as a platform to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying divergent channel behavior between whole cells and macropatches. The empirical results argue that PB-triggered gating involves at least two agonist binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), a single open state that undergoes open-channel block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>), two desensitized states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>), and at least three binding sites mediating channel blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

As a result, we became interested in using the patch model to determine the concentration dependence of blocked channels. In this model, only activated channels undergo blockade, and so we determined the fraction of activated channels that have become blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>, right). This represents the conditional probability of blocked states given that the channel is in a state after activation (P{ <italic>BL<sub>3</sub></italic>, <italic>BL<sub>4</sub></italic>, or <italic>BL<sub>5</sub></italic> | <italic>O</italic>, <italic>BL<sub>3</sub></italic>, <italic>BL<sub>4</sub></italic>, <italic>BL<sub>5</sub></italic>, <italic>D<sub>s</sub></italic>, or <italic>D<sub>f</sub></italic> }). The relationship indicates that nearly 20% of channels are blocked at therapeutic concentrations (100 &#x003bc;M), pointing to a possible contribution of blocked channels to activity at clinically relevant concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>The Addition of Lipophilic PK Compartment to the Patch Model Accounts for Whole Cell Tail Currents</title><p>Divergent features of whole cell tail currents are nonlinearity, slowing of deactivation by increasing PB concentration and pulse duration, being time varying, and having an eightfold lesser amplitude relative to macropatches. We entertained three possible explanations for differences between macropatch and whole cell currents: acknowledged slower exchange kinetics in rapidly perfused whole cells; altered macropatch gating produced by membrane patch excision; and, given the high lipophilicity of PB (octanol/water partition coefficient = 108), a lipophilic PK compartment slowing the effective exchange of PB in the solution bathing the GABARs. Our line of reasoning excluded the first two possibilities (see Discussion), leaving the PK explanation for further consideration. This explanation is supported by transmonolayer diffusion experiments showing that similar barbiturates have low apparent transcellular permeation rates (&#x0223c;0.4 &#x003bc;m/sec) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Behrens et al., 2001</xref>), which could introduce PKs on the order of seconds, consistent with the onset for PB application duration changes in whole cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). We therefore extended the patch model to incorporate a PK submodel to create the PK patch model, and then tested its ability to account for the discordant whole cell results.</p><p>We considered the addition of a simple PK submodel with three compartments representing the perfusion solution, an extracellular compartment containing GABARs that includes the unstirred layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maconochie and Knight, 1989</xref>), and a speculative lipophilic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). The concentration of the perfusion compartment (<italic>C<sub>P</sub></italic>) was considered fixed because the perfusion solution can be considered an inexhaustible source of PB molecules. Concentrations in the extracellular and lipid compartments were normalized by that of the perfusion compartment for simplicity, and its volume (V<sub>P</sub>) was set arbitrarily to a value of 1. <italic>k<sub>12</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>21</sub></italic> were calculated to achieve an exchange time constant of 10 ms and equivalence of <italic>C<sub>P</sub></italic> and the concentration of the extracellular compartment (C<sub>EC</sub>) at steady state in the absence of the lipid compartment. <italic>k<sub>23</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>32</sub></italic>, and the ratio of <italic>V<sub>EC</sub></italic> and <italic>V<sub>L</sub></italic> were determined using constraints of an octanol/water partition coefficient of PB (108) and an exchange time constant of 1.3 s between the extracellular and lipid compartment, which was derived from whole cell onset experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). In the latter, the time constant of time-dependent changes in tail deactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) was taken to reflect a slow component of PB wash-in in the extracellular compartment arising from the proposed PK mechanism. Overall, the synthesis of the PK submodel was completely specified by the identified constraints and therefore independent of the empirical data that it may account for once incorporated into the patch model. The PK submodel introduced a slow component to both PB wash-in and washout time courses in <italic>C<sub>EC</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>, bottom, inset) and thereby transforms the patch model (PK patch model) behavior to reproduce the whole cell plateau value and tail current time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). The PK patch model also predicts other divergent whole cell findings, including deactivation slowing by increasing PB concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>, left) and application duration (not depicted), as well as reduced tail current amplitude concentration&#x02013;response relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>, right).

PB coapplication caused a more rapid activation, enhanced desensitization, and introduced a marked tail current in the GABA-alone response. The tail current observed in PB alone was markedly enhanced by GABA coapplication. To gauge the effect on underlying PB binding, we calculated the fraction blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>, inset), which shows that GABA enhanced binding by nearly fourfold with this endpoint.

The study provides new insights into the mechanism of PB blockade as well as PB-triggered gating in general. Whole cell tail currents showed slowing of the deactivation time course with increasing application time and PB concentration, deactivation occurred over seconds at high concentrations, and peak amplitudes were comparable to those of currents during PB application. These observations accord with previous reports in similar preparations but, remarkably, were absent in macropatch currents. Our initial reasoning (see Patch Model Reconciles Micro- and Macropatch Data in Results) presumed that slower solution exchange kinetics in rapidly perfused whole cells compared with membrane patches may underlie the divergence. As a result, our initial analysis focused on macro- and micropatch currents from rapidly perfused outside-out patches and, in combination with parsimonious mathematical modeling, led us to the following primary findings: the binding of at least five molecules of PB to the channel complex in which two sites govern activation and three sites mediate inhibition; a single dominant open state that undergoes direct blockade; and at least two desensitized states that are kinetically distinct from those of blockade. PB binding to any one of the inhibitory sites causes block of the open state, and subsequent binding to unoccupied inhibitory sites leads to deeper closed states. The associated gating (&#x0201c;patch&#x0201d;) model reproduces the empirical findings in macro- and micropatches.</p><p>The addition of a lipophilic PK compartment to the patch model (&#x0201c;PK patch&#x0201d;) provides reconciliation of all divergent features of whole cell tail currents. The results suggest that PB responses from rapidly perfused whole cell experiments may suffer marked kinetic distortions of current time course arising from effective exchange kinetics that are &#x0223c;100-fold slower than expected. These findings raise a significant question regarding the concentration time course of PB and other lipophilic drugs near membrane-bound receptors during rapid extracellular perfusion of whole cells, which may distort observed current time courses and thereby cast doubt on results obtained from this preparation.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable fundamental finding of the study is that blockade occurs at concentrations nearly sixfold less than for activation due to a threefold greater affinity of inhibitory over activation sites, and channel block arising from PB binding to only one of three sites. This finding is strongly supported by this first report of fractional millimolar PB concentrations causing block reported by tail currents in rapidly perfused macropatches, in conjunction with the results of parsimonious GABAR modeling. The findings suggest that the current thinking regarding the rank order of GABAR sensitivity to PB actions of potentiation &#x0003e; activation &#x0003e; blockade should be revised to potentiation &#x0003e; blockade &#x0003e; activation. Furthermore, greater sensitivity to blockade equates to a higher fraction of blocked channels at clinically relevant PB concentrations (&#x0003c;100 &#x003bc;M) and, when coupled with marked GABA potentiation of blockade, point to a role of blocked states in therapeutic PB modulation of GABA-triggered currents.</p></sec><sec><title>PB-induced Gating</title><p>Macroscopic currents triggered by the rapid application of PB to whole cells expressing &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b3;<sub>2S</sub> GABARs showed a bell-shaped peak current concentration&#x02013;response relationship, enhancement of desensitization, and rebound or tail currents at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>).

We focused on the investigation of tail currents as a reporter of channel blockade. Tail currents have been used previously to gain insight into PB blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serafini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krampfl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2004</xref>) and likely primarily reflect the unblocking process because tail current upstrokes are fast relative to deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krampfl et al., 2002</xref>; and this study, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Previous investigations in rapidly perfused whole cells have reported that tail currents can be described by multi-exponential functions and show concentration-dependent slowing of deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rho et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serafini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2004</xref>). Our results in whole cells accord with these findings at PB concentrations &#x0003c;2,000 &#x003bc;M. However, PB concentrations &#x0003e;2,000 &#x003bc;M produced tail currents with clear nonlinear features (see Whole Cell Tail Currents Are Nonlinear and Time Varying in Results). In contrast, the decay of macropatch tail currents showed little concentration dependence, except for some minor slowing of decay at the highest concentration tested where the time course remained linear (5,000 &#x003bc;M; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). We reasoned the divergence between whole cell and macropatch tail currents may arise from differences in the experimental preparations involving unrecognized slowing of extracellular PB washout. Such reasoning pointed us toward the analysis of macropatch currents in our investigation of PB blockade, especially because tail current upstroke proceeds with millisecond time constants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krampfl et al., 2002</xref>; and this study) and because rapid perfusion techniques achieve wash-in rise times 10&#x02013;90% of &#x0003c;20 ms in whole cell and &#x0003c;1 ms in cell-free membrane patches in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gingrich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burkat et al., 2001</xref>). For these reasons, we relied on the analysis of currents obtained from rapidly perfused macropatches to initially investigate the mechanism of PB blockade.</p></sec><sec><title>Macropatch Currents</title><p>Macropatch results indicate that tail current amplitudes and fractional block both are steeply dependent on PB concentration (slope factors of 2.3 and 3.5, respectively), arguing strongly for the binding of at least three PB molecules in the mechanism of block (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krampfl et al., 2002</xref>). This refines earlier conclusions regarding the number of the underlying PB binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akaike et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Akk and Steinbach, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serafini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akk et al., 2004</xref>). Activation was biexponential at lower concentrations and at high concentrations became monoexponential with time constants in the millisecond range. These results are roughly similar to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akaike et al., (1985)</xref> but differ quantitatively in that we show &#x0223c;10-fold faster activation. This may arise from differences in subunit composition or experimental techniques (whole cell vs. macropatch). Whole cell currents triggered by low concentrations indicate a supra-linear dependence of peak current on concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) and at least two activation sites, which accords with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akaike et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rho et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Akk and Steinbach, 2000a</xref>).</p><p>We considered current decay during PB application to primarily reflect channel desensitization. Our analysis shows that the magnitude of current decline increases with PB concentration and reaches a maximum of &#x0223c;70% relative to peak current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). The time course is well described by a biexponential function where both time constants decrease with concentration. These findings roughly accord with those in frog sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akaike et al., 1985</xref>). Furthermore, the magnitude of desensitization is comparable to previous reports in recombinant channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serafini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2004</xref>) but is greater than in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rho et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalziel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krampfl et al., 2002</xref>). These differences may reflect differences in subunit complement because desensitization is dependent on subunit composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Verdoorn et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gingrich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2004</xref>).

The degree of block was assayed by computing fractional block, which selectively reports the relative proportions of open and blocked channels. The results suggest that GABA coapplication markedly enhances PB binding to inhibitory sites by approximately fourfold. Therefore, in the presence of GABA, PB would be predicted to produce significant blockade at concentrations in the therapeutic range (&#x0223c;100 &#x003bc;M). It is possible that GABA could have other effects on PB-induced gating not considered in this study.

These results provide additional support for PB open-channel block, consistent with previous proposals based on steady-state single-channel studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Akk and Steinbach, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akk et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of open-channel block may involve PB binding that leads either to pore occlusion or allosteric promotion of nonconducting channel conformations. Our results suggest that channel block may arise from the simultaneous binding of up to three PB molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Steric hindrance makes it unlikely for three PB molecules to concurrently bind within the pore, as implied by simple pore occlusion. Therefore, we favor an allosteric mechanism involving three individual binding sites (see Possible Structure&#x02013;Function of Binding Sites Mediating Block below) as described in the proposed patch model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). In this arrangement, the binding of the first PB molecule produces block by promoting a nonconducting conformation and where subsequent binding involves states already rendered nonconducting.</p></sec><sec><title>Patch Model</title><p>We were first interested in developing a parsimonious gating model to serve as a summary of proposed gating mechanisms that reconciles our empirical observations. If this were accomplished, the model would serve as a platform to explore prospective mechanisms underlying marked differences between macroscopic gating in patches and whole cells.

We introduced a first-order kinetic component with a 20-ms time constant to the solution exchange section of the patch model, which depressed tail current amplitudes but failed to reproduce other features of whole cell tail current deactivation including nonlinearity, and slowing by concentration and application duration.</p><p>Alteration in channel gating associated with cell-free membrane patches may also explain the marked differences between whole cell and macropatch tail currents. Patch excision has been shown to reduce channel open times of embryonic nicotinic ACh receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trautmann and Siegelbaum, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Covarrubias and Steinbach, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Akk and Steinbach, 2000b</xref>) by increasing a closing rate that is related to residues on the C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Akk and Steinbach, 2000b</xref>). Similarly, gating of expressed Na<sup>+</sup> channels is altered, which may be related to disruption of cytoskeletal attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shcherbatko et al., 1999</xref>). We are unaware of similar reports in GABARs. Selective changes in a single microscopic rate seem unlikely to account for the marked differences between tail currents of whole cells and macropatches in this study. Furthermore, such changes cannot account for nonlinear behavior of whole cell tail currents observed at higher concentrations. Overall, this explanation appears less likely but cannot be excluded.</p><p>After discounting the above possibilities, we considered whether unrecognized cellular PK effects could be responsible by slowing extracellular PB exchange at membrane-bound GABARs. If exchange becomes similar to or slower than the kinetics of channel gating, the result is ineffective concentration clamp and subsequent obligatory nonlinear GABAR function. A PK mechanism influencing the availability of a lipophilic molecule has been proposed previously in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forman, 1999</xref>). The introduction of a three-compartment PK submodel to the patch model (PK model) provides an accounting of all divergent features of whole cell tail currents (see The Addition of Lipophilic PK Compartment to Patch Model Accounts for Whole cell Tail Currents in Results).</p><p>What data support the involvement of a cellular PK mechanism? PB is highly lipophilic with an octanol-water partition coefficient of 10<sup>2.06</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin-Biosca et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the apparent permeability constant of methylphenobarbital, a barbiturate with physicochemical features similar to PB, is 0.4 &#x003bc;M/sec in transmonolayer diffusion experiments in intestinal Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Behrens et al., 2001</xref>). Presuming that similar gross permeability constants apply to an &#x0223c;20-&#x003bc;M diameter HEK-293 cell, it becomes plausible that the movement of PB through the cell may occur on a timescale of seconds similar to the time course of changes in tail currents produced by increasing application time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). The cellular structures involved in this speculative PK compartment could involve lipophilic phospholipid bilayers composing the cell membrane, the envelopes of intracellular organelles, and lipid-containing vacuoles.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible Structure&#x02013;Function of Binding Sites Mediating Block</title><p>The empirical and modeling findings point to the involvement of three PB molecules in channel blockade. Presuming two PB molecules bind to trigger activation, the GABAR complex must then bind a total of five PB molecules when all binding sites are occupied. This may occur by one PB molecule binding to GABAR subunits with a 1:1 stoichiometry, which is consistent with the current thinking regarding the GABAR molecular pharmacology of PB. GABARs composed of homomeric &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> receptors are largely insensitive to GABA but can be directly activated by propofol and pentobarbitone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishek et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting that fundamental structural determinants for intravenous anesthetic activation may be located within the &#x003b2; subunit.</p><p>Generation of chimeric GABA<sub>A</sub>/GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis has led to the identification of a tryptophan at position 328 within the third transmembrane-spanning domain of the human &#x003c1;1 homo-oligomeric receptor, which imparts barbiturate insensitivity, wherein mutation of this residue produces sensitivity to PB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Amin, 1999</xref>). Mutation of Trp328 to methionine, in the GABA<sub>A</sub> &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> counterpart, confers barbiturate sensitivity. Conversely, substitution of Met286 with tryptophan within homo-oligomeric &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> receptor abolishes pentobarbitone sensitivity. The loss of pentobarbitone function of the mutated &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> subunit is reversed when coexpressed with &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>. Therefore, &#x003b1; subunits are implicated in barbiturate modulation of &#x003b1;&#x003b2; GABARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thompson et al., 1996</xref>). When expressed with &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits, the &#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> subunit diminishes the GABA-modulatory effect of PB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Whiting et al., 1997</xref>). However, the influence of this subunit on PB activation remains unexplored. Recent insights derived from loose-packed models of GABAR extracellular and transmembrane domains resulting in a large amount of solvent-accessible space point to barbiturate-binding pockets on the M3 transmembrane-spanning domain of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ernst et al., 2005</xref>) that may well extend to the &#x003b3; subunit as well. The involvement of &#x003b2; M3-binding pockets with the intravenous anesthetic propofol is also supported by findings in cysteine protection experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bali and Akabas, 2004</xref>). Overall, the evidence is consistent with two PB activation sites that likely reside on each of the &#x003b2; subunits, and three PB inhibitory sites where one each is present on the two &#x003b1; and one &#x003b3; subunits.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological Relevance</title><p>Significant PB blockade is apparent when current rebound is observed at millimolar concentrations. Therefore, one may conclude that this mechanism does not influence GABAR function at clinically relevant concentrations of &#x0223c;100 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franks and Lieb, 1994</xref>), which produces primarily potentiation of GABA-triggered currents. However, our results suggest that block occurs at concentrations nearly an order of magnitude lower than previously thought, and that up to 20% of activated channels may be blocked by 100 &#x003bc;M PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Furthermore, PB blockade is potentiated by GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rho et al., 1996</xref>; this study), consistent with enhancement of underlying PB binding. Therefore, GABA-triggered activity would be associated with even greater fractions of blocked channels at therapeutic PB concentrations. Barbiturates slow the decay of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weiss et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Otis and Mody, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mathers et al., 2007</xref>), thereby enhancing phasic inhibitory neurotransmission at therapeutic concentrations. Emergence from nonconducting (desensitized) states slows the relaxation time course of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones and Westbrook, 1995</xref>). Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that barbiturate slowing of inhibitory postsynaptic currents may arise from the emergence of channels from nonconducting blocked states.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Larry Wagner II for valuable assistance with molecular biology and cell culture in this study.</p><p>This study was supported by a Whitaker Foundation research grant to K.J.
