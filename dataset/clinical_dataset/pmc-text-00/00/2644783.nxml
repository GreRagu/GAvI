The balance between these two phases in murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) is controlled by the replication and transcription activator (RTA) gene. In this report, we investigated the effect of DNA demethylation and histone acetylation on MHV-68 replication. We showed that distinctive methylation patterns were associated with MHV-68 at the RTA promoter during latency or lytic replication. Treatment of MHV-68 latently-infected S11E cells with a DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC), only weakly reactivated MHV-68, despite resulted in demethylation of the viral RTA promoter. In contrast, treatment with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) strongly reactivated MHV-68 from latency, and this was associated with significant change in histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels at the RTA promoter. We further showed that HDAC3 was recruited to the RTA promoter and inhibited RTA transcription during viral latency. However, TSA treatment caused rapid removal of HDAC3 and also induced passive demethylation at the RTA promoter. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we found that the RTA promoter was hypomethylated during lytic infection in the lung and that methylation level increased with virus latent infection in the spleen. Collectively, our data showed that histone acetylation, but not DNA demethylation, is sufficient for effective reactivation of MHV-68 from latency in S11E cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68, also referred to as &#x003b3;HV68), is a member of the gammaherpesvirus subfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Efstathiou1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs), which act in opposition to histone acetyltransferases (HATs), control the level of histone acetylation and serve as means for post-translational modification of nucleosomal histones that influence gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Jenuwein1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Histone acetylation promotes gene transcription by relaxing chromatin structure and facilitating access to DNA by the transcriptional machinery, whereas histone deacetylation promotes transcriptional repression by condensing chromatin structure.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of DNA demethylation and histone acetylation in MHV-68 reactivation. We show that histone acetylation is sufficient for MHV-68 reactivation from latency in S11E cells (a B cell line latently infected with MHV-68), and this process is accompanied by demethylation of the RTA promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1. 5-AzaC treatment weakly led to MHV-68 lytic replication in S11E cells</title><p>It has been reported that EBV and KSHV can be reactivated from latency by DNA methylation inhibitor reagents such as 5-AzaC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Chen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-BenSasson1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004556-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, TPA plus NaB treatment for 36 hrs induced MHV-68 reactivation, leading to production of lytic antigens (lane 8), compared to untreated control cells (lane 1). In contrast, treatment of S11E cells with 5 &#x000b5;M or 10 &#x000b5;M 5-AzaC for 24 or 48 hrs, induced little reactivation of MHV-68 virus (lanes 2 to 5). Extending the treatment to 72 hrs resulted in modestly increased level of reactivation (lanes 6 and 7). The different patterns of lytic proteins induced by 5-AzaC vs TPA plus NaB might be attributed to different signaling pathways involved in viral reactivation. To analyze the reactivation efficiency of 5-AzaC more quantitatively, supernatants were collected for plaque assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004556-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, treating S11E cells with 5-AzaC for 72 hrs resulted in detectable production of infectious viral particles, compared to untreated control cells. However, this production level is very low, as TPA plus NaB treatment generated a significantly higher number of viral particles compared to untreated control.

RTA promoter methylation was associated with MHV-68 latency <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>There were two obvious explanations for the 5-AzaC experiment results: 5-AzaC treatment was unable to induce demethylation of latent MHV-68 genome, or demethylation of the latent MHV-68 genome was not sufficient to induce efficient MHV-68 reactivation. To facilitate examination of these possibilities, we decided to focus on the RTA promoter region on viral genome, since RTA has been shown to be the &#x0201c;molecular switch&#x0201d; for controlling MHV-68 reactivation. Although it has been reported that the whole MHV-68 genome was highly CpG suppressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Chen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, there are a few CpG sites at the RTA promoter near the ATG initiation cordon for RTA protein synthesis. We thus examined an approximately 1 kb fragment in the proximal RTA promoter region which includes 15 CpG sites. For convenience of technical analysis, we divided this 1 kb fragment into two parts, P1 and P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004556-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We performed quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) to detect methylation status at the RTA promoter in S11E cells during latency and after reactivation. As a comparison, we also analyzed the RTA promoter on viral genome from virions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004556-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, the ratio of methylation-specific products and unmethylation-specific products was different among these 3 groups of samples, suggesting a much higher percentage of methylated CpG sites on RTA promoter in S11E cells than in virions, and that the percentage of methylated CpG sites dramatically decreased after viral reactivation induced by TPA plus NaB treatment.</p><fig id="pone-0004556-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004556.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Methylation status at the MHV-68 RTA promoter.</title><p>(A) A schematic view of the RTA promoter on MHV-68 genome (NC_001826, n.t. 65695-66879). The 15 CpG sites shown were analyzed in this study, the promoter region divided into two parts for analysis, named P1 and P2. (B) Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) analysis of the RTA promoter methylation status. Genomic DNAs were prepared from untreated S11E cells, MHV-68 virion or TPA (25 ng/ml) plus NaB (4 mM) treated S11E cells. Then Q-MSP was performed to detect methylation status of the RTA promoter P1 and P2 fragments, using methylation-specific (M) or unmethylation-specific (U) primers, respectively. Standard reactions were performed at the same time to quantify copy numbers, and the ratio of methylation-specific and unmethylation-specific products was calculated for each sample. Results represent the average from three experiments, with standard deviations shown. (C) Combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) of the MHV-68 RTA promoter methylation status. Genomic DNAs were prepared from untreated S11E cells, MHV-68 virion, 5-AzaC (10 &#x000b5;M, 36 hrs) induced S11E cells or <italic>de novo</italic> infected MHV-68 BHK-21 cells, bisulfite modified, and subsequently used for PCR amplification. The PCR products were digested by Taq&#x003b1;| for COBRA. The digested products for P1 fragments are 84 bp, 52 bp, 136 bp, 447 bp and 395 bp. The digested products for P2 fragments are 411 bp and 91 bp. (D) Bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS) analysis of the 15 CpG sites at the RTA promoter.

Each group included eight independent clones.

In this method, sodium bisulfite treatment of DNA fragment converts unmethylated cytosines to uracils. PCR amplification of the converted fragment leads to creation of new, or loss of existing, restriction site (s), and susceptibility or resistance to selected restriction enzyme digestion reveals the methylation status of the original DNA fragment. For the RTA promoter P1 fragment, the majority of the DNA extracted from S11E cells (80&#x02013;90&#x00025;) could be digested by Taq&#x003b1;|, indicating methylation of the DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004556-g002">Fig. 2C, lane 2</xref>). 5-AzaC treatment resulted in a large proportion of the CpG sites (approximately 80&#x00025;) resistant to Taq&#x003b1;| digestion, indicating demethylation induced by 5-AzaC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004556-g002">Fig. 2C, lane 4</xref>). As a comparison, only 10 to 20 percent of the DNA sample from virions could be digested by Taq&#x003b1;|, suggesting that they were mostly in unmethylated status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004556-g002">Fig. 2C, lane 3</xref>).

We thus decided to further investigate the methylation status of this DNA fragment on individual viral genomes, using bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS). Results showed that in latently infected S11E cells, majority of the CpG sites in the RTA promoter region were methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004556-g002">Fig. 2D, panel a</xref>).

Taken together, these data indicated that distinctive methylation patterns were associated with MHV-68 at the RTA promoter during latency or lytic replication in cell culture.

Trichostatin A (TSA) strongly reactivated MHV-68 from latency in S11E cells</title><p>Our data above indicated that DNA demethylation is not sufficient for MHV-68 reactivation, at least in the S11E cells we tested. Since histone acetylation also plays a role in regulating gene transcription, we next investigated whether modification of histone acetylation of the MHV-68 genome could induce MHV-68 to go to lytic replication from latency in S11E cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004556-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, when S11E cells were treated with TSA for 24 or 36 hrs (200 ng/ml, lanes 2 and 6; or 1000 ng/ml, lanes 3 and 7), increased MHV-68 lytic protein expression was detected by western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against MHV-68 lytic antigens, indicating reactivation of MHV-68 virus.

For instance, HDAC1 and HDAC2 exist in NuRD (Nucleosomes remodeling and deacetylase) as well as at least two other distinct complexes to repress transcription, and the NuRD complex also contains MBD3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Zhang2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Sengupta1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, demethylation will result in removal of MeCP or MBDs, leading to dissociation of the NuRD complex containing HDAC1/HDAC2 and hence activating gene transcription. Consistently, previous reports showed that in KSHV, it was HDAC1, but not the HDAC3, which was recruited to the RTA promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Lu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, and demethylation of the KSHV ORF50 promoter strongly induced viral reactivation from latently infected cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Chen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast, HDAC3 depends upon SMRT (Silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptor) and N-CoR (Nuclear receptor co-repressor) complexes to remodel the promoter structure and repress transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Heinzel1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Alland1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Wen1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Guenther1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>.

Consistently, our data showed that, during MHV-68 latency, HDAC3 was recruited to the RTA promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004556-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), however, demethylation of the RTA promoter could not remove the HDAC3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004556-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) and thus was not sufficient to effectively reactivate the virus from latency. This may also offers an explanation for why we could not detect synergistic effects between 5-AzaC and TSA treatment for induction of MHV-68 reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004556-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), in contrary to many reports showing that inhibiting DNA methylation and histone deacetylation can synergistically induce gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Gore1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Zhang3">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Sharma1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the DNA demethylation and histone acetylation associated with gammaherpesvirus reactivation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in the same system. In this system we found that histone acetylation plays a much more significant role in regulating MHV-68 reactivation. As a comparison, KSHV can be reactivated from latently infected BCBL-1 cells by either the DNMTs inhibitor reagent such as 5-AzaC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Chen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, or the HDAC inhibitors such as NaB or TSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004556-Lu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. These data show that both reagents were strong to reactivate the virus, though the reactivation efficiencies could not be directly compared due to the usage of different investigating methods. We hypothesize that in the MHV-68 system, DNA methylation is critical for maintaining the viral latency status, while histone acetylation is important for chromatin structure remodeling at the RTA gene promoter and accordingly induces MHV-68 reactivation. It should be noted that, till now only one naturally occurring MHV-68 latently infected cell line has been isolated. Performing similar analysis in additional MHV-68 latently infected cell lines (once available) will yield more information and shed more light on the role of epigenetic modification in controlling MHV-68 reactivation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>1.
