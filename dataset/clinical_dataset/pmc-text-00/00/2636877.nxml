Time of survival was dependent on the dose of RADA and pre-incubation with PrPsc prior to inoculation. RADA treatment resulted in the absence of detectable PrPsc at 40 d followed by an increased rate of PrPsc accumulation at 75 d up to sacrifice. In all PrPsc inoculated animals, clinical symptoms were observed &#x0223c;10 d prior to sacrifice and brains showed spongiform degeneration with Congo red positive plaques. A time-dependent increase in reactive gliosis was observed in both groups with more GFAP detected in RADA treated animals at all time points. The PrP protein showed dose-dependent binding to RADA and this binding was competitively inhibited by Congo Red. We conclude that RADA disrupts the efficacy of prion transmission by altering the rate of PrPsc accumulation. This is the first demonstration that a self-assembling biomolecular peptide can interact with PrPsc, disrupt the course of Scrapie disease process, and extend survival.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are incurable, fatal neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of abnormal prion protein (PrPsc), neuronal cell death and vacuolation of brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004440-Prusiner1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

RADA combined with Scrapie results in an initial delay in detectable PrPsc followed by increased accumulation at later time points. There is a concomitant delay in observable Scrapie symptoms despite elevated PrPsc levels at 75-days when equivalent control animals required sacrifice. Moreover, RADA treatment shows a similar time-course for the induction of reactive gliosis and GFAP as PrPsc alone, but with increased levels at all time points. Furthermore, we show dose-dependent binding of PrP to RADA and demonstrate competitive binding inhibition of PrP to RADA with the amyloid-binding dye Congo red. We postulate that a physiochemical interaction of PrPsc with RADA impedes the efficacy of prion conversion and disease progression by disrupting the rate of PrPsc accumulation through altered clearance and distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Increased survival time in animals inoculated with PrPsc and RADA-peptide</title><p>Hamsters inoculated with PrPsc combined with RADA survived significantly longer than those that received an equivalent dose of PrPsc alone.

The symmetrical self-assembled beta-sheet rich RADA-scaffold may provide a complimentary surface for PrPsc binding and consequently uncoupling the process necessary for PrPc to PrPsc conversion.</p><p>Alternatively, the interaction of PrPsc with RADA may competitively disrupt PrPsc binding to endogenous ECM proteins. This could result in altered clearance of the PrPsc&#x0002b;RADA complex or a distinct extracellular distribution. A change in clearance of PrPsc mediated by RADA binding could result in a reduced PrPsc titer retained in the brain that would account for the delay in prion accumulation at 40 d and the increased survival. Yet, this does not explain the progressive increase in reactive gliosis from the time of inoculation, the increased rate of PrPsc accumulation from 40- to 75 d with a disconnect between the severity of clinical disease and total PrPsc. However, this could be explained by an altered extracellular distribution of the PrPsc-RADA complex. Localization to secondary sites not normally involved in PrPc to PrPsc conversion could act to sequester the PrPsc from it preferred neuronal site. Here the PrPsc&#x0002b;RADA complex could be more susceptible to protease degradation within the extracellular matrix or via intracellular pathways. Indeed, the conversion of PrPc to PrPsc can occur at multiple cellular sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004440-Lee1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004440-Solassol1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. If a predominant, neuronal site is required for the neuropathological impact of prion disease then accumulation at secondary sites, such as glia, could alter the neuropathology. The progressive increase in reactive gliosis observed in animals inoculated with PrPsc&#x0002b;RADA suggests an active disease process but may reflect a more robust neuro-protective response.</p><p>Future experiments will determine binding of prion from different species and strains to RADA and the capability of RADA to disrupt <italic>in vitro</italic> PrPc to PrPsc conversion. The participation of an intrinsic rodent RGD-like motif in PrPc&#x0002b; protein interaction might account for discrepancies in the efficacy of prion conversion between species, strains, and anti-prion compounds observed in assays based on the rodent PrP protein. A further evaluation of PrP interaction with synthetic peptides corresponding to RGD motifs may be useful in elucidating the molecular mechanism by which certain compounds exert their anti-prion activity and illuminate distinct biochemical properties inherent in the structural variability of prions. We conclude that RADA impedes the propagation of PrPsc from endogenous PrPc resulting in an altered rate of PrPsc accumulation that delays disease onset and extends survival.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Female Syrian Golden hamsters (LVG) at 4 weeks of age were housed in pairs on a 12 h light-dark cycle.
