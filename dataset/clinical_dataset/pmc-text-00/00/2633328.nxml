The most frequently reported ailments were malaria (25.6%), different types of pain (14.0%) and dermatitis (7.4%). The main forms for preparation were decoction (58.1%) and powdered plant material (28.4%). The most frequent used plant parts were leaves (37.7%) and stem bark (18.6%). The healers' consensus for the main indications is fairly high for the four plants <italic>B. petersianum, C. cordifolia, C. molle </italic>and <italic>O. celtidifolia</italic>, and this supports the traditional use of these plants.

The country is composed of various climatic zones and a diversity of ethnic groups. The life expectancy in Mali is about 44 years for males and 47 years for females. This disturbing health situation of short life expectancy is due to the predominance of infectious diseases and parasites. To improve their health, people use both conventional and traditional medicine. In 2004 the density of physicians in Mali was 0.08 per 1000 inhabitants while already in 1978 there was one healer per 500 inhabitants in Mali [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Traditional medicine still remains the main resource for a large majority of people treating health problems. Being a comprehensive knowledge system, traditional medicine encompasses the utilization of substances, dosages and practices based on socio-cultural norms and religious beliefs as well as witnessed experiences and observations of a specific group. This knowledge is handed down from generation to generation in order to diagnose, prevent or eliminate a physical, social or spiritual imbalance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>In Mali, the Department of Traditional Medicine (DMT) is a collaborating centre of the World Health Organization (WHO) research for traditional medicine. The DMT has as one of their primary objectives to assure that traditional medicine is complementary to conventional medicine, assuming that the medicines can be produced from local resources, especially from medicinal plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. DMT has carried out many phytochemical, pharmacological and toxicological studies with the ultimate goal of providing effective and non-toxic medicine to the population. There are several factors that are taken into account when selecting plants to be studied. One important factor is that several healers from different regions use the same plant to treat the same disease, and that the disease which the plant is used against represents a public health problem. From this work seven improved traditional medicines (ITMs) have been recognized as essential medicines in Mali and are being sold alongside conventional medicines in pharmacies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The plants in our survey were chosen by DMT as they want to investigate if these plants are suitable candidates for development into new ITMs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p>An ethnopharmacological survey was carried out in the regions around Siby and Dioila in November and December 2007, and a total of 58 healers were interviewed. 27 healers in the villages Siby, Dogoro and Gouena (Siby area) and 1 healer in the village Sirimabougou (Dioila area) were interviewed about the medicinal usage of <italic>Biophytum petersianum </italic>Klotzsch. (Oxalidaceae) and <italic>Opilia celtidifolia </italic>Endl. ex Walp. (Opiliaceae). 30 healers in the villages Banko, Sirimabougou and Ngolobougou (Dioila area) were interviewed about the medicinal usage of <italic>Cola cordifolia </italic>Sim (Sterculiaceae), <italic>Combretum molle </italic>R.Br. ex G.Don. (Combretaceae), <italic>Parkia biglobosa </italic>Benth. (Leguminosae) and <italic>Ximenia americana </italic>L. (Olacaceae).</p><p>The healers were asked whether or not they were using the plants in their practice. When a healer was using a plant in his practice, the information collected also included indication, part(s) of the plant being used, method(s) of preparation and details of administration, including the approximate amounts and number of doses per day. In some cases the healers reported the use of the <italic>Loranthus spp. </italic>when asked about a specific plant. Although the <italic>Loranthus spp. </italic>is distinct species it is discussed as a part of the plant it grows on because the healers see it as a part of the plant in question. The interviews were performed in the Bambara language with Professor Drissa Diallo and Doctor Sekou Bah, DMT, Bamako, and Ngolo Ballo, a plant systematist at DMT, as interpreters.</p><p>Prior to the interviews the healers were given information about the project, the participants in the survey and its goals. In respect of tradition, gifts of cola nuts (<italic>Cola nitida </italic>(Sterculiaceae)) and money were bestowed upon the traditional healers. The conversations with the healers are built on trust with the common goal of increasing the knowledge on medicinal plants and improving the health situation in the country.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title><italic>Biophytum petersianum </italic>Klotzsch.

Various other ailments were also reported (Table 1, see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).

The plant is also used against stomachache in Nigeria, and in Gabon the roots and seeds are consider to be purgative. The powdered seed mixed with shea-butter is applied to wounds in Nigeria and a root decoction is used against gonorrhoea and kidney stone. In Cameroon and Mozambique the plant is used as an antidote against scorpion sting and snake bite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Because of its highly sensitive leaves, which fold up in response to weather or touch, <italic>B. petersianum </italic>is used in magic and sorcery for several different purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Biological activities</title><p>Methanolic extract has shown effect on COX-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and different types of polyphenolic compounds, some with effect on the COX-1/-2 system, have been isolated from <italic>B. </italic>sensitivum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Different types of extracts from the plant have shown anti-inflammatory activity on the carrageenan-rat paw endema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and complement fixing polysaccharides from the plant have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The results above may explain the traditional use in treatment of malaria as the complement system is a part of the innate immune system and activating of the immune system can accelerate the body's immune response to malaria. The use in treatment of pain may be explained by the plant extract's modulation of COX expression and anti-inflammatory activity. Guruvayoorappan and Kuttan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] have recently been performing a large scale investigation of antitumor effects of <italic>Biophytum sensitivum</italic>, and they have found that methanolic extracts of <italic>B. sensitivum </italic>have apoptotic effect on B16F-10 cells, and regulatory effects on NO- and cytokine production on tumor-associated macrophages. They also found that the methanolic extract stimulates the immune cell system in mice, leading to immune cell proliferation and that this, in turn, can stimulate NK cell-mediated tumor lysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title><italic>Cola cordifolia </italic>Sim (Sterculiaceae)</title><p>Local name: N'tabanok&#x000f2;</p><p><italic>Cola cordifolia </italic>grows on the savannah in Senegal to Mali and is a large tree up to 15&#x02013;25 m high, with a short buttressed trunk, low-branching with a dense crown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><sec><title>Traditional use</title><p><italic>Cola cordifolia </italic>is a remedy used to cure several diseases.

Various other ailments were also reported (Table 1, see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The stem bark of <italic>C. cordifolia </italic>was used most frequently (51.4%) followed by the <italic>Loranthus spp. </italic>of the plant (13.5%) and the combination of leaves and stem bark (10.8%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The two most used preparations were decoction (67.6%) and preparation of a powder (24.3%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The decoction is usually used for a bath and/or to drink. The powder is usually dissolved in water and used for a bath and/or to drink, or the powder is thrown into fire and the smoke is inhaled. The healers' consensus for the main indication is fairly high, and this supports the traditional use of <italic>C. cordifolia </italic>as a remedy to treat different types of pain.</p><p>According to literature a decoction of the powdered bark of <italic>C. cordifolia </italic>is used in Mali for treatment of old wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. An ethnopharmacological survey carried out in the areas around Dioila and Bandiagara, Mali, indicated that the plant was used in treating a wide variety of ailments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The bark is also used in Casamance, Senegal, in maceration for chest-affections, and together with other medicinal plants for blennorrhoea. A water-concoction is drunk in The Gambia for constipation, and the inner bark applied to a swollen finger is said to hasten maturation of pus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Maceration of the twigs is administered in Casamance, Senegal, to facilitate childbirth. Water in which split-up small branches have been soaked is taken in The Gambia as a diuretic.

In 1988 Diop et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] investigated the Vitamin C content in fresh fruits from West-Africa. Togola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] found that the crude water extract had complement fixing activity and this could implement a role in activating the immune system. These results may explain the medicinal use since the activating of the immune system is involved in the immune response fighting diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec><title><italic>Combretum molle </italic>R.Br. ex G.Don.

In our survey the main indication is malaria (62.5% of the reported ailments for <italic>C. molle</italic>) followed by different types of pain (12.5%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Various other ailments were also reported (Table 1, see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The most frequent part of the plant used is the leaves (75.0%) and the <italic>Loranthus spp. </italic>of the plant (15.0%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Decoction (80.0%) and a preparation of powder (17.5%) are the most commonly used preparations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The decoction is usually used for a bath and/or to drink. The powder is usually suspended in water and used for a bath and/or to drink, or the powder is thrown into fire and the smoke is inhaled. The healers' agreement about the main indication is fairly high and this supports the traditional use of <italic>C. molle </italic>against malaria.</p><p>4 healers used the <italic>Loranthus spp. </italic>of <italic>C. molle </italic>for fortune seeking and to chase away evil spirits/and curses.</p><p>According to the literature <italic>C. molle </italic>is used in wound healing procedures in the Bamako region, Mali [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In Senegal the plant is held to be cholagogic, but inferior to <italic>Combretum crotonoides </italic>(Combretaceae) and <italic>Combretum micranthum </italic>(Combretaceae), and an aqueous suspension of powdered bark together with the mumuye gum is used as a gargle and in draught for sore-throat. The Dagarar of Burkina Faso applies powdered bark to sores. The bark along with cereal foods is taken for dysentery, and is used in ceremonial preparation for young children to prevent sickness and other troubles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Leaves are prepared as a decoction for baths and draughts, or powdered and added to food in treatment of dropsy, ascites and oedemas in Senegal. In Ivory Coast and Nigeria this plant is used in the absence of that popular panacea, kinkeliba (<italic>C. micranthum</italic>) for treating jaundice and yellow fever, and in Burkina Faso it is given for abdominal complaints, diarrhoea etc., blennorrhoea, anuria, etc., and sometimes to women in childbirth to hasten the expulsion of the after-birth. Lobi of Burkina Faso often takes a decoction of leafy twigs in draughts and baths for bronchial affections and Bobo of Ivory Coast consider the plant a poison-antidote. The Maninka also treats whitlows by steeping the affected part in a leaf-decoction. Alcoholic extracts of leaves with water extracts of twigs have shown capacity to reduce sarcoma tumors in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In the southern part of Senegal the plant is ascribed with magical properties by the Fula and Fouladou to promote courage in battle by inhaling smoke emitted from fire on which bark and branches have been placed.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] found <italic>C. molle </italic>to have both anti-inflammatory and antischistosomal activity. These findings indicating that <italic>C. molle </italic>has antiprotozoal and anti-inflammatory activity may explain the traditional use of the plant against malaria and pain.</p></sec></sec><sec><title><italic>Opilia celtidifolia </italic>Endl. ex Walp.

The use of <italic>O. celtidifolia </italic>in treatment of dermatitis in Mali has also been previously reported by Togola et al. in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], where an ethnopharmacological survey showed that dermatitis was the main indication. In Mali the term dermatitis is used as a common term for all kinds of skin disorders. Various other ailments were also reported, but only one or two healers reported usage of the plant for each ailment (Table 1, see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The leaves of <italic>O. celtidifolia </italic>are the most frequent plant part used in traditional medicine (87.1% of the cases) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), and a decoction (64.5%) is the most common preparation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

A decoction of the leaves is used against fever in Ivory Coast. In Senegal a decoction is used as a gargle for dental abscesses, to treat oedema and as a general stimulant. The plant has internal and external use; against leprosy, acting as a purgative, and leaves reduced to ash are used against headache. The plant is said to have a violent action on the digestion system, and the stem and root are anthelmintic. In Nigeria the plant is primarily used in veterinary medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Biological activities</title><p>In the literature there are only a few surveys on the biological activity of <italic>O. celtidifolia</italic>, most of the previous work have been focused on the chemistry of the plant. Togola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] isolated polysaccharides with complement fixing and macrophage stimulating activity from the water extract. Both the complement system and the macrophages are part of the immune system and play a role in the wound healing process. The activation of these processes may indicate that the polysaccharides from <italic>O. celtidifolia </italic>play a role in the wound healing process and this could explain the extensive use of different leaf preparations against dermatitis in Mali. In earlier work Shihata et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] isolated saponins from the methanol extract and found anthelmintic and antispasmodic activities for these compounds. Saponins are reported to have a number of biological activities, among them immunostimulatory, antipyretic and antiparasitic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

The stem bark of <italic>P. biglobosa </italic>was used most frequently (56.8%) followed by the leaves of the plant (21.6%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The two most used preparations were decoction (62.2%) and preparation of a powder (29.7%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The decoction is usually used for a bath and/or to drink. The powder is usually dissolved in water and used for a bath and/or to drink, or the powder is thrown into fire and the smoke is inhaled. The healers' agreement for the main indication for <italic>P. biglobosa </italic>is relatively low and it is therefore more difficult to pinpoint the most important traditional use of this plant.</p><p>2 healers used <italic>P. biglobosa </italic>for fortune seeking and to chase away evil spirits/and curses.</p><p>According to the literature the leaves, bark and pods are used to treat new and old wounds in Dogonland, Mali [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The bark-infusion is taken in Kordofanan in Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and South-East Nigeria as a tonic and anti-diarrhoetic. The bark is commonly sold in herbalist shops in the western part of the Region for the analgesic action it confers in mouthwashes and steam-inhalations for toothache. A red colour is imparted to the mouth while the saponins in the bark contribute asepsis. In Casmance, Senegal, the bark has wide usage: alone for female sterility, baths and by draughts, and similarly administrated in prescription with other drug-plants for skin-infections and leprosy, and for blennorrhoea. Fula and Tukulor people of Senegal drink a decoction against <italic>Schistosoma </italic>infection. In Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso the pounded bark with lemon juice added is applied to sores and ulcers; a decoction is considered anti-rachitic, tonic and febrifugal; and it is one of 32 other plants in a complex prescription used in the Kaya region for leprosy. The bark is chewed by men in The Gambia for lack of virility; the cause will then, it is said, be voided on going to the latrine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The leaves have some undefined medicinal use in Niger. In Nigeria and The Gambia root and leaf are pounded together in water to produce an eye-lotion. In Senegal medicinal use of the leaf is restricted to external applications. The leaves (and bark) are used in eye-lotion. The crushed leaf is made up into poultices, and to dab on the lips to dissipate 'fever spots'. They are made into steam inhalations in The Gambia for toothache. Lightly heated, then crushed, the leaflets are applied to burns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Biological activities</title><p>Agunu et al.

Preparations made of other plant parts and combinations of the parts mention above are more unusual, ranging from 0.5 &#x02013; 2.8% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The usages of the <italic>Loranthus spp</italic>. growing on the different medicinal plants were also reported quite frequently (6.5%) compared to earlier ethnopharmacological studies performed in Mali (usage not reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and unpublished results).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Plant part used &#x02013; All plants</bold>. The most used plant parts overall.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1746-4269-4-26-4"/></fig><p>In another ethnopharmacological study of medicinal plants in Dioila, Kolokani and Siby (Mali), Togola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] reported that the leaves (56.3%) and the roots (30.0%) were the most frequently used plant parts. The leaves (22%) and the roots (24%) were also the most frequently used parts in a survey performed in Dogonland (Mali) by Inngjerdingen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] in 2004. That the leaves are the most frequently used plant parts corresponds well with our own findings, but we found the stem bark to be the second most cited plant part used. The roots was only used 10.7% of the cases. There could be many reasons for this, but one explanation could be that the different surveys have been focused on different medicinal plants.</p><p>In our survey the overall results for used plant parts differ from the results of <italic>C. cordifolia</italic>, <italic>P. biglobosa </italic>and <italic>X. americana</italic>. The stem bark was the most frequent used plant part of <italic>C. cordifolia </italic>(51.4%) and <italic>P. biglobosa </italic>(56.8%). For <italic>X. americana </italic>the most frequent plant part used is the root (48.7%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Togola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] reported that the need and use of stem bark increased during the dry and windy season from February to May due to the lack of leaves during this period. Our survey was carried out in November-December after the rainy season so lack of leaves is probably not the explanation for the use of stem bark and roots in this case. A number of the healers also told us that they used stem bark from different sides of the tree (North, East, South and West). The reason for this could be to ensure that the tree will survive when they are collecting the bark, because removing larger areas of bark from just one side of the tree could expose so much of the trunk that the tree might acquire diseases and eventually dies.</p><p>Decoction was by far the most used method of preparation (58.1% of the citations for all plants) followed by powder and a combination of decoction and powder (28.4% and 7.0% respectively). Other methods of preparations were also used, but only to a minor extent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In another study performed by Togola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] decoction was also the most frequent way of preparation (65%) followed by infusion of powder (13%). These findings are similar to the results of our study.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Method of preparation &#x02013; All plants</bold>.

Inhalation of steam was used in treatment of throat infections and fumigation was often used in the treatment of headache.</p><p>Different types of additives are sometimes used by the healers when preparing the remedies. Salt, food and drinks are used to improve taste of the preparation and thus the patients' compliance. Butter, oil and mud are used to make ointments or liniments for external use of the medicinal plants. The healers in our survey in some cases also used the combination of different medicinal plants to treat ailments (Table 1, see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>For most ailments and remedies, the dosage given depends upon the sex, age, duration of illness, health and physical condition of the patient. The doses vary from 1 teacup for 1 day to 3&#x02013;4 teacups 3 times a day for several days for oral administration. The same is noted when the treatment is a bath, often it is enough with a bath other times it is required several baths a day for a longer period of time. This variation was also noted when the plant was used to treat the same ailment. Togola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] suggested that the variation of the doses and duration of treatment from one healer to another may indicate that the plants have a low degree of toxicity. That corresponds well with our survey where the only side effects reported were diarrhoea and vomiting, and only in connection with <italic>O. celtidifolia</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study over 60 medicinal indications were reported for the six medicinal plants investigated. The healers' consensus for the main indications is fairly high for the four plants <italic>B. petersianum, C. cordifolia, C. molle </italic>and <italic>O. celtidifolia</italic>, and this supports the traditional use of these plants. However for <italic>P. biglobosa </italic>and <italic>X. americana </italic>the healers' consensus is less consistent and it is more difficult to draw conclusions about the most important traditional use of these two plants.</p><p>This survey complements the ongoing investigation of different medicinal plants from Mali. The ultimate goal for our project is to provide efficient and non-toxic medicines to the population in Mali, where medicinal plants still remains the main resource for a large majority of people treating health problems. Chemical characterization and the biological-, pharmacological- and toxicological activity of the plants are currently under investigation. Plant extract showing bioactivity corresponding to the traditional application of the plant can validate the traditional medicinal usage of the plant. These studies will hopefully provide important knowledge necessary for designing therapeutic agents from the plants.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors performed the interviews with the healers and identified all plant material described.</p><p>TEG and BSP drafted and finalised the manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Additional file 1</title><p><bold>Table 1</bold>.
