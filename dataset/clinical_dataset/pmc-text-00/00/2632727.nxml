In this study, we characterize a novel murine model of AKI following hepatic IR. Mice subjected to ~70% liver IR not only developed acute liver dysfunction, but also developed severe AKI 24 hr after liver injury. Mice subjected to liver IR developed histological changes of acute tubular injury including focal proximal tubular cell necrosis involving the S3 segment, cortical tubular ectasia, focal tubular simplification and granular bile/heme cast formation. In addition, there was focal interstitial edema and hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Inflammatory changes in the kidney after hepatic IR included neutrophil infiltration of the interstitium and upregulation of several pro-inflammatory mRNAs (tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, keratinocyte derived cytokine, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, intercellular adhesion molecule-1). In addition, marked renal endothelial cell apoptosis was detected involving peritubular interstitial capillaries, accompanied by increased renal vascular permeability. Finally, there was severe disruption of renal proximal tubule epithelial filamentous-actin. Our results show that AKI rapidly and reproducibly develops in mice after hepatic IR and is characterized by renal tubular necrosis, inflammatory changes and interstitial capillary endothelial apoptosis.

Hepatic IR injury is a major cause of acute liver failure (ALF) and is frequently associated with major hepatic resection, liver transplantation, or septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs frequently in patients with acute liver failure (ALF) and is a serious clinical problem during the perioperative period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). For example, the incidence of AKI in patients with ALF ranges from 40&#x02013;85% depending on the diagnostic criteria and etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). In addition, AKI is a common complication after orthotopic liver transplantation and exponentially increases patient mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>). Unfortunately, the pathophysiology of AKI associated with ALF is poorly understood in part due to a lack of diagnostic histological changes or an adequate animal model for this critical clinical syndrome. Moreover, development of AKI after liver injury in mice has never been described in detail.</p><p id="P3">Previous animal models for AKI associated with liver failure include carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) injection after bile duct ligation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) and partial hepatic IR in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). The CCl<sub>4</sub> injection model is limited by the chronic nature of the protocol requiring several (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) weeks (whereas human renal failure associated with ALF can develop acutely). The rat model of AKI after liver IR is limited by the modest nature of renal dysfunction after liver IR injury which therefore fails to mimic the severity of human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>).</p><p id="P4">In this study, we tested the hypothesis that mice subjected to severe liver IR develop AKI resembling human AKI associated with ALF. We demonstrate that mice subjected to hepatic IR develop AKI in less than 24 hr characterized by proximal tubular necrosis and inflammation. Moreover, renal peritubular endothelial cell apoptosis, peritubular/interstitial neutrophil infiltration, JGA hyperplasia as well as marked disruptions of the kidney tubular actin cytoskeletal architecture were observed. Our results show that mice subjected to liver IR develop AKI rapidly, closely mimicking the time course of this complication in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Murine model of hepatic IR</title><p id="P5">After Columbia University IACUC approval, male C57BL/6 mice (25&#x02013;30g, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital, 50 mg/kg or to effect. Mice were placed under a heating lamp and on a 37&#x000b0;C heating pad. After a midline laparotomy and intraperitoneal application of 20 U heparin, left lateral and median lobes of the liver were subjected to 60 min. of ischemia with a microaneurysm clip occluding the hepatic triad above the bifurcation. This method of partial hepatic ischemia results in a segmental (~70%) hepatic ischemia but spares the right lobe of the liver and prevents mesenteric venous congestion by allowing portal decompression through the right and caudate lobes of the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Preliminary studies showed that 30, 60 or 90 min. of liver ischemia causes mild, moderate or severe liver injury, respectively. The liver was kept moist with gauze soaked in 0.9% normal saline. The body temperature was monitored by an infrared temperature sensor (Linear Laboratories, Fremont, CA) and maintained at 37&#x000b0;C using a heating lamp and a heating pad. After 60 minutes, the liver was reperfused and the wound closed. Sham operated mice were subjected to laparotomy and identical liver manipulations without the vascular occlusion. Twenty four hr after reperfusion, the liver tissue subjected to IR and both kidneys were collected to measure necrosis, neutrophil infiltration (with immunohistochemistry) and apoptosis (with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining). In some mice, liver and kidneys were collected 4 hr after reperfusion to detect renal inflammation by RT-PCR for pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs.

Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of AKI associated with liver failure is poorly understood, largely due to a lack of a reproducible and reliable animal model. A reproducible animal model would allow preclinical testing of therapeutic approaches that could lead to human therapy. In this study, we describe a model of AKI in mice induced with liver IR that is reproducible, rapid to develop (in less than 24 hr) and mimics the histological (renal tubular damage, apoptosis, necrosis and JGA hyperplasia) as well as biochemical (plasma creatinine, inflammatory markers) changes observed with human AKI associated with ALF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>).</p><p id="P24">Although the pathophysiological and biochemical mechanisms of AKI associated with liver failure are not fully understood, the initiating event appears to be portal hypertension&#x02013;induced splanchnic vasodilatation with subsequent intrarenal vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>).

Upregulation of renin-angiotensin system leads to severe reduction glomerular filtration rate, urinary sodium excretion and free water excretion. It has been proposed that intense intra-renal ischemia subsequent to renin-angiotensin activation leads to renal tubular necrosis and renal dysfunction. In this study, we show significant hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular apparatus with increased cellularity in mice subjected to liver IR.

After liver IR injury, circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors including TNF-&#x003b1; and HMGB1 increase significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). Release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and HMGB1 from the liver may promote inflammatory changes in the kidney after liver IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>). These pro-inflammatory factors can upregulate endothelial adhesion molecules in distant organs including the kidney. Upregulation of renal endothelial adhesion molecules including E-selectin, P-selectin, and ICAM-1 promotes leukocyte recruitment and extravasations to the renal interstitial space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>). In addition, circulating bile acids, endotoxin and circulating immune complexes may contribute to the development of AKI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). Combined, these contributing factors may potentiate systemic inflammation leading to renal injury and renal PMN infiltration.</p><p id="P26">The endothelial barrier serves to protect against AKI by regulating leukocyte recruitment to the areas of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). In this study, we were surprised to observe a marked endothelial cell apoptosis in the kidney after liver IR (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref> and <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Apoptosis is an important contributor in the development of renal failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>). Apoptotic cell death represents the execution of an ATP-dependent death program often initiated by death ligand/death receptor interactions, such as Fas ligand with Fas, which leads to a caspase activation and cleavage of nuclear materials such as DNA and PARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>). After liver IR, we show that endothelial cell apoptosis in the kidney was much more prominent than the proximal tubule cell apoptosis. This is in contrast to the findings after renal IR where proximal tubule cell apoptosis predominates. Endothelial cell death due to apoptosis would impair defense against leukocyte invasion into the kidney leading to a further exacerbation of renal injury. The results of our study suggest that reducing endothelial cell death may limit renal injury associated with ALF.</p><p id="P27">In this study, we demonstrate not only significant endothelial cell apoptosis but also recruitment of PMNs to the kidney after liver IR. Neutrophils are activated during and after liver ischemia and activated neutrophils attach to and then transverse the renal capillary endothelium into the subendothelial space, where they release enzymes and cytokines, causing direct renal injury and the recruitment of other injurious cells, such as monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>). Weakened endothelial defenses after liver IR may potentiate the PMN infiltration and conversely, increasing the survival of endothelial cells after liver IR may limit PMN infiltration into the kidney and improve renal function. Future studies with endothelial stabilizing agents (such as activated protein C or sphingosine-1-phosphate) will determine whether protecting endothelial integrity will reduce renal injury after liver IR injury.</p><p id="P28">Ischemia reperfusion injury <italic>in vivo</italic> results in degradation of F-actin. Breakdown of F-actin contributes to the pathophysiology of organ dysfunction after ischemia reperfusion injury or sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>). Whereas we were not surprised to see changes in liver F-actin content after liver IR (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>), we were surprised to demonstrate that renal F-actin breakdown occurs with liver IR. Actin cytoskeletal damage contributes significantly to the development of AKI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>). Moreover, F-actin disruption promotes apoptosis in several cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>). Therefore, loss of actin cytoskeleton may have contributed to the development of renal tubular and endothelial apoptosis after liver IR.</p><p id="P29">We demonstrate in this study that plasma ALT and Cr has a direct and linear relationship: mice with higher ALT showed increased renal dysfunction after liver IR. However, we also noted that the degree of renal dysfunction was mild when the plasma ALT levels were below 10000 U/L. Behrends et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>) recently studied the renal dysfunction after extensive liver IR injury in rats. In their study, rats subjected to 75 min. of partial liver IR developed acute liver dysfunction at 24 hr. However, the degree of renal dysfunction in their rat model was mild with modest increases in plasma creatinine. They also noted upregulation of ICAM-1 mRNA expression over control animals but no changes in renal MCP-1, MIP2 and iNOS expression were noted. Correspondingly, the kidneys from rats subjected to liver IR showed little morphological damage and they failed to see increases in apoptosis (caspase-3) and neutrophil infiltration (myeloperoxidase activity). Their study confirms previous observations in rats that renal dysfunction was mild with little or no histological changes after liver IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>). Polat <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that 45 min. of liver ischemia resulted in mild renal dysfunction without detectable changes in renal morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). The reason for this discrepancy between our mouse model and the previous rat model is unclear. However, in the study by Behrends et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>), plasma ALT rose only to ~6800 U/L whereas in our mouse model, the plasma ALT rose much higher (~15&#x02013;20000 U/L). Longer liver ischemic period (e.g., 90 min.) in a rat is usually lethal (unpublished observations). Therefore, it appears that the murine model is better suited as model of liver failure induced AKI than the rat model.</p><p id="P30">Some investigators utilized carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) induced cirrhosis as a model of liver failure induced renal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Our model has several advantages over this model as our model is more clinically relevant, does not require administration of a tubular toxin, and results in rapid and severe AKI. The CCl<sub>4</sub> injection model is limited by the chronic nature of the protocol requiring several weeks (whereas human AKI can develop in less than a week). Moreover, full blown renal dysfunction does not usually occur until day #3 with the CCl<sub>4</sub> model whereas we can produce liver failure induced AKI in less than 24 hr.</p><p id="P31">To our knowledge, this is the first study utilizing mice to develop a model of AKI after acute liver dysfunction. Our model of AKI after liver IR closely mimics human AKI associated with ALF in terms of severity and the acute nature of renal dysfunction as well as similarities in histological changes. Utilization of mice has further advantages in that genetically modified mice are available to complement pharmacological approaches in studying the signaling mechanisms as well as examining potential therapies for AKI associated with ALF.</p><p id="P32">Serum creatinine is the most commonly used clinical indicator of glomerular filtration rate but its reliability as a measurement of glomerular filtration rate may be limited by several factors after acute liver injury. One of the main functional consequences of acute liver injury is a dramatic reduction in serum protein level which influences the intravascular volume and glomerular filtration rate. Acute liver injury actually can lead to low serum creatinine due to decreased hepatic conversion of creatine to creatinine, decreased dietary protein intake and increased renal tubular secretion of creatinine. The increased fraction of creatinine excretion by tubular secretion in the setting low GFR also diminishes the reliability of creatinine as a marker of renal dysfunction. Consequently, the plasma creatinine values reported in this study in mice (0.91&#x000b1;0.15 mg/dL) may actually underestimate the degree of acute kidney injury associated with liver IR. Our measurements of plasma BUN correlated less well with renal function, probably because of interference with the urea cycle and hepatic metabolism after liver IR.</p><p id="P33">In summary, we have developed a novel murine model of AKI after liver IR, which closely approximates the human disease, characterized by renal tubular necrosis, endothelial cell apoptosis, PMN infiltration and JGA hyperplasia. Our model should provide a useful experimental context to delineate the mechanisms of AKI after liver IR and evaluate potential pharmacological therapies. Our study is the first to characterize the histological changes in detail and to demonstrate marked endothelial apoptosis and F-actin destruction in AKI associated with acute liver injury. It remains to be determined in future studies whether stabilization of endothelial cells would protect against AKI after liver IR injury.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S22" sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Table</title><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Correlation between plasma ALT and creatinine (Cr) values (p&#x0003c;0.0001 and r<sup>2</sup>= 0.8925).
