The endosomal turnover of ubiquitylated IL-1RI is also controlled by Tollip. Furthermore, together with Tom1, Tollip has a general role in endosomal protein traffic. This work shows that Tollip is involved in the sumoylation process. Using the yeast two-hybrid technique, we have isolated new Tollip partners including two sumoylation enzymes, SUMO-1 and the transcriptional repressor Daxx. The interactions were confirmed by GST-pull down experiments and immunoprecipitation of the co-expressed recombinants. More specifically, we show that the TIR domain of the cytoplasmic region of IL-1RI is a sumoylation target of Tollip. The sumoylated and unsumoylated RanGAP-1 protein also interacts with Tollip, suggesting a possible role in RanGAP-1 modification and nuclear-cytoplasmic protein translocation. In fact, Tollip is found in the nuclear bodies of SAOS-2/IL-1RI cells where it colocalizes with SUMO-1 and the Daxx repressor. We conclude that Tollip is involved in the control of both nuclear and cytoplasmic protein traffic, through two different and often contrasting processes: ubiquitylation and sumoylation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tollip is an interactor of the Toll family of proteins, which are highly conserved in evolution from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to <italic>Man</italic>, and include the Toll-like and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors, all involved in the inflammatory response. The sequence of Tollip, spanning 274 amino acids, contains some characterized functional domains. A C2-like domain, lacking the two conserved Asp residues critical for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding and present in numerous eukaryotic proteins as a binding site for a variety of phospholipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Burns1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. A C-terminus ubiquitin binding CUE domain identified by Shih et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Shih1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> as a ubiquitin binding site that mediates intramolecular monoubiquitylation. At the amino-terminus (aa 1&#x02013;54), a GAT/TOM1 interacting domain is also described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Yamakami1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. So far, Tollip has been involved in two main functions. The first, proposed by Burns and collaborators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Burns1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, indicates Tollip as an interactor of the IL-1 receptor TIR domain, mediating the binding of the serine/threonine kinase IRAK-1 to the activated receptor complex, thus being integral part of the IL-1RI signaling cascade. Later, Yamakami &#x00026; Yokosawa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Yamakami2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> proposed a negative regulatory role of Tollip on the IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; signaling pathways, in agreement with the inhibition of NF-kB activation observed following Tollip overexpression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Burns1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Zhang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The second function, described by Yamakami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Yamakami1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, concerns the interaction of Tollip with Tom1, Ubiquitin and Clathrin in a high molecular mass complex involved in protein sorting. In agreement with this proposal, an endosomal function of the protein was suggested by Katoh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Katoh1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Katoh2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, Brissoni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Brissoni1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> have recently shown that Tollip is required in the sorting of the IL-1RI at late endosomes, further clarifying its involvement in the IL-1 inflammatory pathway. Zhang and Ghosh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Zhang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> have shown that Tollip associates not only with IL-1RI but also with the TLR2 and TLR4 receptors when activated by LPS stimulation. Also this interaction results in the suppression of TLR-mediated cellular responses through the inhibition of phosphorylation and kinase activity of IRAK1.</p><p>We show, for the first time, the involvement of Tollip in the sumoylation process. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification of proteins that conjugate SUMO-1 with a lysine of the target peptide through the formation of a covalent bond. This reaction is very similar to the ubiquitylation process and it is catalyzed by three enzymes, that act in succession: 1) El, the dimeric activation complex, composed of the proteins Aosl and Uba2; 2) the single E2 conjugation enzyme named Ubc9; 3) at least three types of E3 ligases. The first group of E3 ligases is encoded by the protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription (PIAS) family and entails the 5 mammalian members: PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASx&#x003b1;/ARIP3 , PIASx&#x003b2;, and PIASy. These ligases are characterized by the presence of a RING-finger-like structure essential to their function. The second group is represented by the RanBP2/Nup358 protein, which is a component of the nucleopore complex and does not contain the ring finger domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Pichler1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The third type is Pc2, a member of the polycomb group of proteins (PcG) involved in gene silencing. Pc2 recruits the CtBP repressor to the PcG nuclear bodies and enhances its sumoylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Kagey1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. These ligases are not protein specific and show overlapping targets. In fact, it is not clear how the specificity of the sumoylation reaction is achieved. It seems likely that more ligases or cofactors exist and contribute to the specificity of the modification process.</p><p>In order to further characterize the function of Tollip, we have screened a cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system, looking for Tollip partners. In addition to the known interactors, TOM1, Tollip itself and ubiquitin, we have isolated Daxx, SUMO-1, and the E2 (Ubc9) and E3 (ARIP3) sumoylation enzymes. This work shows that Tollip binds Ubc9, SUMO-1 and at least three ligases of the Pias family and is itself sumoylated. The binding domain of Tollip to the ligases of the PIAS family and of the ARIP3 ligase to Tollip are identified. In particular, in a SAOS-2 clone enriched in IL-1RI receptors (SAOS-2/IL1R), Tollip translocates into the nucleus where it co-localizes with SUMO-1 and Daxx, in nuclear bodies. The SAOS-2/IL1R clone was derived from the SAOS-2 osteoblastoma cell line which constitutively expresses IL-1RI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Dedhar1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Rodan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and was kindly provided by Dr Sandra Marmiroli (Modena and Reggio Emilia University). Our results may correlate with the interaction of Tollip with the RanGAP-1 protein. Furthermore, we identify the cytoplasmic domain of IL-1RI as a target of Tollip sumoylation. We propose that Tollip is involved in the nuclear translocation of proteins either as a sumoylation cofactor or a ligase.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Tollip interacting proteins</title><p>The yeast two-hybrid mating assay was carried out as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">material and methods</xref>.

The majority of cDNA recombinants were coding for ubiquitin or ubiquitin fused to ribosomal RNA subunits.

Interestingly, proteins involved in the sumoylation process (SUMO-1, Ubc9, ARIP3) and the transcriptional repressor Daxx are among the interactors that we have isolated. The interactions of Tollip with some of the identified proteins were confirmed by GST-pull down experiments. The B42 fused <sup>35</sup>S-peptides were incubated with GST-Tollip or GST beads and the interaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and authoradiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). All the peptides analyzed interact with Tollip but not with the GST control. B42 alone does not interact with Tollip, showing the specificity of the reaction. The cytoplasmic region of the IL-1RI accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and IL-1RI were used as positive control. To confirm the interactions observed in yeast, 293T cells were transfected with the pRK7-HA-Tollip cDNA together with constructs coding for Ubc9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g001">Fig. 1B</xref> ) or the Flag-ARIP3 fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). 293T cells expressing the unrelated protein HA-Cystatin B, together with Ubc9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) and Flag-ARIP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>) were used as control. The immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies (abs) shows that Ubc9 (B) and Flag-ARIP3 (D) co-immunoprecipitate with HA-Tollip but not with the control protein (C and E), confirming the specificity of the binding.</p><fig id="pone-0004404-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004404.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Tollip interactions.</title><p>A) GST-Tollip interaction with <sup>35</sup>S-methionine labelled proteins isolated by the yeast two hybrid technique.

This shows that HA-Tollip interacts with a region of ARIP3 spanning residues 169&#x02013;347. This domain is highly conserved in the PIAS family of proteins. Thus, we investigated the possible interaction of Tollip with other members of the family.

The analysis of the rat amino acid sequence (accession BC133067.1) indicates at least 3 putative sumoylation sites within the C2 domain (the lysines at position 96, 143, and 162). However, the transfection of 293T cells with HA-Tollip together with Flag-SUMO-1, Ubc9, and Flag-ARIP3 shows that, under the conditions tested, Tollip migrates as a monomer at the expected molecular weight of 29 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). No additional slow migrating bands can be detected. This set of experiments suggests that Tollip is not covalently modified. However, the presence of ubiquitin-like protease activity (Ulp) in native cell lysates combined with the short half-life of the SUMO-1 modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Johnson1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Hay1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> may destabilize the process. Thus, we have carried out an additional experiment were 293T cells were co-transfected with HA-Tollip and SUMO-1 and the cells were lysed under denaturing conditions, to block protease activity and exclude non covalent association with interacting proteins. The control cells were transfected with SUMO-1 only. The staining of the protein extracts with anti-SUMO-1 abs generates a similar pattern of bands in the two samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g003">Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2</xref>). The immunoprecipitation of the same protein extracts with anti-HA abs is shown in panel B lanes 3&#x02013;6. Both SUMO-1 and anti-HA abs generate bands migrating in corresponding positions of the gel, at a molecular weight higher than monomeric Tollip (compare lanes 3 and 5). This result confirms that Tollip is sumoylated, possibly in more than one lysine residue. It should be noticed, however, that Tollip may be dimeric as well as ubiquitinated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Shih1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Yamakami1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and this makes it difficult to relate the molecular weight to the number of SUMO-1 molecules covalently bound to it. We can conclude that in 293T cells Tollip is transiently sumoylated. The low intensity of the sumoylation bands detected in the imunoprecipitation blot may be due to the process of de-sumoylation of modified Tollip that certainly occurs. To test the possible effect of Tollip on the sumoylation process, 293T cells were transfected as indicated and the protein extracts were analyzed by western blot with anti-Flag abs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The sumoylation bands are not detectable in the protein extracts of not transfected cells (lane 1). The transfection with SUMO-1 cDNA shows a band ladder in the high molecular weight range suggesting sumoylation of numerous proteins (lane 2). Cotransfection of SUMO-1 and Tollip increases the intensity of the sumoylated bands, suggesting activation of the sumoylation process (lanes 3 and 5). This trigger is specifically due to Tollip, since overexpression of an unrelated cDNA does not activate the sumoylation process (lane 4). The intensity of the actin bands shows that the amount of proteins loaded on each lane is the same.</p><fig id="pone-0004404-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004404.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Sumoylation of Tollip.</title><p>A) Western blot analysis of protein extracts from 293T cells transfected as indicated above the figure and stained for the proteins indicated on the right.

We have analyzed the possible modifications of the receptor co-transfected with the Tollip and the SUMO-1 proteins. The transfection of the full length IL-1RI receptor in 293T cells gave poor efficiency and very low expression of the protein. As the cytoplasmic region of the receptor interacts with Tollip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), we have used this domain for the transfection experiments. 293T cells were transfected as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> and the protein extracts were stained with anti IL-1RI abs. Transfection of the cytoplasmic region of the IL-1RI shows a single band migrating at about 25 KDa. Cotransfection of the cells with plasmids expressing SUMO-1 (lane 2) and the sumoylation enzymes (lane 3) only slightly modifies the banding pattern of the receptor protein. In addition to the expected band of the cytoplasmic receptor, a second band migrating at the approximate molecular weight of 40 kDa can be detected. However, the transfection of the cells with HA-Tollip together with SUMO-1 triggers the formation of a banding pattern ranging between 25 and 100 kDa molecular weight (lane 4). The western blot of the cell extract immunoprecipitated with anti-IL1RI abs and stained with anti-SUMO-1 abs shows that the band ladder contains SUMO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g004">Fig. 4B lane 2</xref>). After immunoprecipitation, at least four of the sumoylated bands stained by the abs are co-migrating with the receptor bands (compare lanes 1 and 2). This strongly suggests that sumoylation modifies the migration characteristics of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. We can conclude that the interaction of Tollip with the sumoylation enzymes triggers the sumoylation of IL-1RI. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g004">Figures 4D and E</xref> analyze the banding pattern of the cytoplasmic receptor in cells transfected with the &#x00394;1 and &#x00394;2 receptor deletion mutants indicated in C.

SUMO-1 is partly diffused in the nuclear region, and partly aggregated in what may be PML bodies. None of the cells that we have examined shows colocalization between SUMO-1 and Tollip (panels C and D). In contrast, a different cellular distribution of the two proteins is observed in the human SAOS-2/IL-1R osteoblastoma cells in which IL-1RI is constitutively overexpressed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g005">Fig. 5 panels E&#x02013;H</xref> show the localization of transfected HA-Tollip and endogenous SUMO-1 in SAOS-2/IL-1R cells.

The nuclear bodies in these cells show a yellow colour indicating colocalization between Tollip and SUMO-1. We conclude that, in SAOS-2/IL-1R cells, Tollip together with SUMO-1 are translocated into the nucleus and internalized into nuclear bodies.

Through the two-hybrid screening of a rat cDNA library we have identified sequences coding for the described Tollip partners: Tom1, ubiquitin and Tollip itself. However, the presence of several recombinants coding for Ubc9, Daxx, ARIP3, and one clone coding for SUMO-1 came as a novelty. These interactors strongly suggest a role of Tollip in sumoylation. The remaining clones were not further analyzed. The identification of the binding site between HA-Tollip and the Flag-tagged ligases shows that the carboxyl-terminus of the C2 domain contains the ligase binding region. In the ARIP3 ligase, the binding region is just upstream the RING domain.</p><p>A direct interaction between Tollip and the E2/E3 sumoylation enzymes suggests that the protein is sumoylated. Sumoylation is not a stable reaction and a complex network of modifying and demodifying enzymes is present both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm and controls the modification process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Melchior1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, Tollip sumoylation is detectable only in cells lysed in 1&#x00025; SDS under conditions that block protease activity. It may be noticed that the co-transfection of 293T cells with the SUMO-1 and Tollip coding plasmids is sufficient to induce Tollip sumoylation suggesting that, under these conditions, the sumoylating enzymes are not limiting. The rat Tollip sequence contains 8 lysines as potential sumoylation sites, and it is possible that the sumoylated bands immunoprecipitated with Tollip are only due to SUMO-1 modification of the protein. However, different covalent modifications and, in particular, polyubiquitylation may occur in lysine residues either competing with each other for the same site or independently regulated by events that depend on the target of interest. Although sumoylation does not usually target proteins to destruction, it has been recently shown that sumoylated proteins may become targets of E3 ubiquitylation ligases for proteosomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Meulmeester1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Tatham1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

The strong increase of the anti-SUMO-1 abs staining shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g003">figure 3C</xref> indicates that the overexpression of Tollip activates the overall cellular sumoylation of the proteins, thus suggesting a rather general role of Tollip in this process. Tollip sumoylation and its interaction with Ubc9 suggest a function of Tollip as a ligase. Conversely, the interaction of Tollip with three different members of the PIAS ligase family favours the idea of a sumoylation adaptor.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Tollip mediates IL-1RI sumoylation</title><p>Our experiments identify at least one sumoylation substrate of Tollip: the IL1-RI receptor. Here we show for the first time that this receptor is sumoylated. IL-1RI sumoylation occurs within the evolutionary conserved TIR domain, which is responsible for the activation of the IL-1 signalling cascade. Furthermore, the TIR domain is the site of ubiquitylation of IL-1RI mediated by Tollip. The equilibrium between receptor ubiquitylation and sumoylation is probably important in modulating the signaling cascade of IL-1, establishing the number of receptors present on the cell surface. Tollip may play a pivotal role in modulating the IL-1RI activity through the different modifications. Hoeller et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Hoeller1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> have shown that monoubiquitylated sites do not interact with polyubiquitinated proteins. It is possible that monoubiquitylated Tollip interacts with the receptor stabilizing its sumoylation. Alternatively, un-ubiquitinated Tollip interacts with the polyubiquitylated IL-1 receptor accumulating it in the late endosomes for degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Tollip has a nuclear function</title><p>In contrast with the instability of Tollip sumoylation, its expression in 293T cells seems to trigger stable modification of proteins other than Tollip, suggesting a general activation of the process following over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004404-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). One of the cellular proteins constitutively modified by SUMO-1 is the RanGTPase binding protein RanGAP-1, the binding partner of the RanBP2 ligase, a nucleoporine that serves as a docking site for the nuclear import of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Pichler2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Pichler1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Accordingly, for the first time we show a nuclear localization of Tollip. We do not know what the nuclear function of Tollip may be but we can speculate on some hypothesis. Nuclear Tollip may be important for the sumoylation of nuclear substrates. Alternatively, Tollip could function as a carrier for nuclear localization of sumoylated proteins, as suggested by the interaction with RanGAP-1. Tollip may be involved in the translocation and nuclear localization of the cytoplasmic portion of a number of membrane receptors, among which the sumoylated cytoplasmic IL-1RI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004404-Lin1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

The regulation of transcription occurs mainly through the recruitment of transcriptional co-repressors that cause downregulation. Daxx is a transcriptional co-repressor interacting with many sumoylated factors leading to SUMO-dependent repression and Daxx interacts with Tollip. Generally, Daxx is localized in the nucleoplasm and in defined nuclear structures, i.e. in the SUMO-modified PML bodies, in the nucleolus and interacts with CENP-C in the centromere, possibly exerting different functions in the different compartments. In conclusion, here we show that Daxx interacts and colocalizes with Tollip, thus suggesting the existence of a nuclear function of Tollip, and a role of Tollip in Daxx dependent transcriptional regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Anti-HA, Ubc9, SUMO-1, Daxx and IL-1RI abs were purchased from Santa Cruz.

The GST-Tollip fusion protein was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and purified by binding to Glutathione-Sepharose beads. In vitro transcription of the identified interactors was carried out using the Riboprobe in vitro Transcription System (Promega) according to the manufacturer instructions. In vitro translation was carried out using the Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) in presence of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine (Amersham Bioscience). The GST pull-down assays were carried out by incubating equal amounts of GST or GST-Tollip immobilised to Gluthathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Bioscence) with 5 &#x000b5;l of <sup>35</sup>S-labelled translation product in 100 &#x000b5;l final volume (binding buffer: 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 6, 150 mM NaCl, 10&#x00025; glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, 0.02&#x00025; Nonidet P-40) The mixtures were incubated 3 h at room temperature and washed three times with binding buffer.

The cDNAs coding for rat Tollip wild type and its deletion mutants were cloned into the pRK7-HA expression vector. The cDNAs coding for rat Ubc9, the cytoplasmic region of the rat IL-1RI receptor and its mutants were cloned into the pRK7 expression vector. The cytoplasmic portion of IL-1RI spans aminoacid 355&#x02013;569 of the rat cDNA sequence (accession NP_037255). The cDNA coding for rat SUMO-1, PIAS-1, PIASxb, ARIP3 and its deletion mutants were cloned into the pcDNA3.1-Flag-C expression vector, which is a modified version of the pcDNA3.1-His C plasmid (Clontech) where the hystidine tag sequence was replaced with a Flag coding sequence. The cDNA recombinant clones were amplified by PCR from the rat cDNA library used for the two hybrid screening. Transfection of 293T cells with the expression vectors was performed using Polyethylenimine (PEI) (Sigma Aldrich) according to manufacturer instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis</title><p>293T cells were lyzed, 24 hr after transfection, in RIPA buffer (300 mM NaCl, 0.5&#x00025; NP40, 20 mM Hepes KOH pH 8, 20&#x00025; Glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 0.4 mM EDTA pH 8) and sonicated. Lysis under denaturing conditions was carried in 1&#x000d7; PBS containing 1&#x00025; SDS. The samples were boiled 10 min and diluted 10 times in PBS, containing a cocktail of anti-proteases and anti-phosphatases (Sigma), to a final concentration of 0.1&#x00025; SDS.

Following 5&#x02032; incubation in 0.1&#x00025; Triton X-20, 3&#x00025;BSA the cells were stained with mouse anti-Tollip and rabbit anti-SUMO-1 abs followed by incubation with FITC conjugated anti-mouse and Cy3 conjugated anti-rabbit secondary abs. After staining, the cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Confocal images were acquired using a Radiance 2000 confocal laser scanning microscope (BioRad), equipped with a Nikon x60, oil immersion 1.4 N.A. objective and with krypton and red diode lasers. For FITC and Cy5 double detection, the samples were simultaneously excited with the 488-nm line of the krypton laser and with the 637-nm line of the red diode laser. The emission signals from FITC and Cy5 were separated by a dichroic mirror (DM; 560 nm) and simultaneously detected by two photomultiplier tubes. Two barrier filters (BP; 515/30 nm for FITC and LP; 660 nm for Cy5) were placed before the two photomultiplier tubes to minimize the overlap between the two signals, as previously described. Optical sections were obtained at increments of 0.3 &#x000b5;m in the Z-axis and were digitized with a scanning mode format of 512&#x000d7;512 pixels and 256 grey levels. Image processing and volume rendering (extended focus and surface-shaded) were carried out using the ImageSpace software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) running on a workstation Indigo (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA.).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very grateful to Dr. Dasso, theNational Institute of Child Health and Development, Betsda, for providing the anti RanGap-1
