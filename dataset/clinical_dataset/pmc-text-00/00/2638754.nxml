In this time, there has been a rapid increase in the number of publications and reports in this area, but interpretation and comparisons have been compromised by a lack of common understanding and language. A need was thus identified to develop an International Classification for Patient Safety (ICPS) that would pave the way for researchers to understand each others' work and facilitate the systematic collection, aggregation and analysis of relevant information on patient safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZN055C5">5</xref>].</p><p>An opportunity to address this need was presented by the launch of the World Alliance for Patient Safety of the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZN055C6">6</xref>]. A Drafting Group of international experts was formed under the auspices of the World Alliance. After reviewing the relevant literature and examining existing classifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZN055C7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZN055C10">10</xref>], an initial version of a framework was developed, with definitions of a few basic concepts. Between August and November 2006, this framework and its accompanying concepts were subjected to a two-stage web-based modified Delphi survey to test the relevance and acceptability of the ICPS, including the conceptual framework and the underlying terms and concepts. The Delphi methodology is a research technique designed to obtain opinions from experts in a particular field through the use of subsequent rounds of questionnaires combined with the provision of feedback to build consensus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZN055C11">11</xref>]. The aim of the two-stage survey was to test the relevance and acceptability of the ICPS and to support the Drafting Group in producing an initial draft version of the conceptual framework for the ICPS for field testing. An iterative process was undertaken through which the initial draft conceptual framework (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MZN055F1">1</xref>), concepts and definitions were progressively refined and improved. This paper concentrates on the overall Delphi process to illustrate its impact on the conceptual framework and high-level classes; definitions for key concepts and preferred terms were agreed as part of this process and are discussed in a companion paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZN055C12">12</xref>].</p><fig id="MZN055F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Initial draft conceptual framework.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mzn05501"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Over 300 experts in the field of patient safety, health policy, reporting systems, safety and quality control, classification theory and development, health informatics, consumer advocacy, law and medicine were directly invited to participate in the Delphi survey. Input was also sought from a wider stakeholder constituency. Open invitations to take part in the Delphi process were placed in an article published in the <italic>International Journal for Quality in Health Care</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZN055C13">13</xref>] and on the websites of the WHO's World Alliance for Patient Safety, the Australian Patient Safety Foundation, The Joint Commission in the USA and the UK National Patient Safety Agency.</p><p>Experts who accepted the invitation to participate, and those who responded to the wider invitation, were asked to complete two confidential questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Questionnaire development</title><p>The web-based questionnaire was developed and designed using Survey Monkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZN055C14">14</xref>] as the platform. Survey Monkey is a web-based, flexible, scalable, secure survey development tool. It was pre-tested with 18 participants with clinical knowledge and/or experience with coding/classifying patient safety incidents from the Australian Patient Safety Foundation, the National Patient Safety Agency and The Joint Commission. This was performed on two occasions to support face and content validity and to understand the practical elements of the design. Considerable refinements were made to the survey tool, particularly to the navigational structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Round 1 survey</title><p>The first round of the web-based Delphi survey took place between 18 August and 22 September 2006. The questionnaire included sections on: (i) participant demographics including age, gender, country, native language, whether the respondent was a healthcare professional and expertise and practical experience in collecting, classifying and/or analysing patient safety data; (ii) the conceptual framework, including questions on the (a) adequacy, coverage and meaningfulness of the conceptual framework itself, (b) the clarity, precision and adequacy of the terms and definitions for each of the 10 classes within the conceptual framework and (c) views on the meaningfulness and usefulness of each of the 10 classes and (iii) overall comments. In any case where respondents thought there could be improvement, open comments were sought. The questionnaire was designed to direct respondents to a comments page to be completed before proceeding.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Round 2 survey</title><p>The second survey, sent only to those who responded to the first round, took place between 1 and 27 November 2006 and included the same sections and questions as the first survey, with two additions: an enhanced introductory explanation of the classification, and quantitative and qualitative feedback from the first survey for each question. The feedback included an explanation for the modifications made, or not made, to the classification based on the first round results.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Analysis and redrafting</title><p>The results for both surveys were tabulated using quantitative and qualitative analyses. Quantitative analysis of the structured responses was undertaken to describe the overall responses, whereas all open responses were reviewed in detail to identify common themes and key issues.</p><p>At the end of round 1, using face to face, teleconference and email discussion, the Drafting Group made appropriate modifications to the ICPS and to the supporting information and the detailed method for round 2.</p><p>Following the second round, the Drafting Group reviewed the results in a 2-day face-to-face meeting. After this meeting, it was agreed to undertake further detailed review of the open Delphi comments. Each individual comment was reviewed by one of the three members of the Drafting Group, and a response to each comment was provided, including a description of any change (if appropriate) made to the ICPS as a result. This was shared with the Drafting Group, and the conceptual framework was further iteratively revised by the Drafting Group between December 2006 and July 2007. The revised version &#x02018;The Conceptual Framework for the International Classification for Patient Safety Version 1.0 for use in field testing 2007&#x02013;2008&#x02019; was produced at the end of July 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZN055C15">15</xref>].&#x000a0;</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Round 1 survey results</title><p>Two hundred and fifty-three people speaking 29 different languages from 43 countries responded to the first round; 161 responded to the personalized invitation letter sent by the Drafting Group and 92 responded to the open invitation. The respondents included healthcare professionals, health policy experts, developers/managers of patient reporting systems, patient/public representatives, academics, representatives from professional associations for a variety of healthcare specialties, litigation experts, classification/taxonomy experts, risk managers and representatives from organizations responsible for assessing and monitoring patient safety performance. Eighty-one percent (205/253) had practical experience in collecting, classifying and/or analysing patient safety data.</p><p>All comments were reviewed. The number of comments ranged from 11 to 137 per question; 146 general comments were made.

The main deficit in initial response was the fact that 14% (35/253) of the respondents felt that the conceptual framework was missing at least one class; this was 19% (14/75) of those who responded to both surveys. However, upon analysis of respondents' comments, it was apparent that most of the respondents were referring to &#x02018;concepts&#x02019; they felt should be included within the classes instead of &#x02018;classes&#x02019; that should be included within the conceptual framework.

In particular, confusion remained about the relationships among the classes of &#x02018;contributing factors&#x02019;, &#x02018;preventive factors&#x02019;, &#x02018;recovery factors&#x02019;, &#x02018;mitigating factors&#x02019; and &#x02018;actions taken&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Major modifications to the ICPS</title><p>The initial class for describing what happened was an &#x02018;event&#x02019;. The Delphi responses indicated that the term &#x02018;event&#x02019; was problematic because it is not generally perceived to include underlying hazards and potentially dangerous circumstances. The term &#x02018;incident&#x02019; is widely used in healthcare patient safety literature and is understood to include events, hazards and circumstances. &#x02018;Event&#x02019; was therefore changed to &#x02018;incident&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZN055C8">8</xref>].</p><p>The Delphi analysis also revealed confusion about the meanings of, purposes for and relationships between the classes, specifically &#x02018;contributing factors&#x02019;, &#x02018;preventive factors&#x02019;, &#x02018;recovery factors&#x02019;, &#x02018;mitigating factors&#x02019; and &#x02018;actions taken&#x02019;. In addition, it was felt that some classes were incomplete and, in some instances, inappropriately organized. The classes were therefore refined to ensure that the concepts within a class were organized hierarchically and fell into categories, which are brief and easily and commonly understood.</p><p>The classes&#x02014;contributing factors, preventive factors, recovery factors, mitigating factors and actions taken&#x02014;were introduced or revised to address this confusion and provide building blocks for the important meta-concepts of system resilience and recovery. The concept of recovery is particularly important if learning from patient safety incidents is to occur. However, the term &#x02018;recovery factors&#x02019;, widely used in industrial safety settings to describe recovery from an incident, produced confusion among some clinical respondents who equated the term &#x02018;recovery&#x02019; with clinical recuperation. Recovery factors were defined as the &#x02018;actions or circumstances that follow detection of an incident and prevent or moderate its progression so as not to result in harm&#x02019;. Recovery thus has both a detection phase and a mitigation phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="MZN055C16">16</xref>]. Therefore, to alleviate the confusion, the Drafting Group decided to create &#x02018;detection&#x02019; and &#x02018;mitigating factors&#x02019; as classes to signify the detection and action phases and to delete the class &#x02018;recovery factors&#x02019;.</p><p>&#x02018;Detection&#x02019; is defined as &#x02018;an action or circumstance that results in the discovery of an incident&#x02019;. An incident could be detected by noticing an error, via a monitor or alarm, by a change in the patient's status, or via an audit, review or risk assessment. Detection mechanisms may be built into the system as formal barriers or informally developed. Detection is thus a necessary component of the system to allow subsequent mitigation or amelioration. &#x02018;A mitigating factor&#x02019; is defined as &#x02018;an action or circumstance which prevents or moderates the progression of an incident towards harming a patient&#x02019;. &#x02018;Mitigating factors&#x02019; are generally actions, but they can be due to good luck or chance. Therefore, they were labelled &#x02018;factors&#x02019; rather than &#x02018;actions&#x02019;. Thus detection by a dispensing pharmacist of prescription of an interacting drug by a doctor could lead to a change in the prescription, thus mitigating the potential adverse effects.</p><p>&#x02018;Ameliorating actions&#x02019; was created as a new class. It was borne from the ambiguities in the meanings of mitigation/recovery, action taken and preventive factors. To develop this class, the Drafting Group revisited the literature and reviewed real incident reports. The concepts contained in this class are not circumstances, but are actions undertaken by the healthcare professional or organization to &#x02018;right a wrong&#x02019;. The concepts signify that specific action was taken, i.e. &#x02018;doing something&#x02019;, so the descriptor &#x02018;action&#x02019; was substituted for &#x02018;factor&#x02019;. Ameliorating actions take place after the incident has already caused harm to the patient. An example would be the resuscitation of a patient who had suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of inadvertent injection of high-concentration potassium chloride or treatment of a post-operative wound infection with antibiotics.</p><p>The original concepts for the organizational outcomes class were adapted from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) [17]. It became clear from the Delphi responses that these concepts, even as modified, were not fit for purpose. Revised concepts populating this class were derived from incident reports and are concepts widely used in this context in health care.</p><p>A significant outcome of the Delphi analysis was recognition of the need to clarify the semantic relationships between the &#x02018;preventive factors&#x02019; class and the other classes. The class was relabelled as &#x02018;actions taken to reduce risk&#x02019;. Its component concepts are both informed by and inform the classes &#x02018;contributing factors/hazards&#x02019;, &#x02018;detection&#x02019;, &#x02018;mitigating factors&#x02019; and &#x02018;ameliorating actions&#x02019; and focus on learning and system resilience.

An early draft was based on existing classifications. A consultation process using a modified Delphi survey resulted in changes being made to the presentation and structure of the initial framework and to the definitions of its major classes. The conceptual framework and classes are described in greater detail, as are the agreed definitions of other key concepts and their relationships to the framework, in companion papers. The final conceptual framework is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="MZN055F4">4</xref>.</p><p>The Delphi approach engaged disparate stakeholders in the refining of the original drafts of &#x02018;The Conceptual Framework for the International Classification for Patient Safety Version 1.0 for use in field testing in 2007&#x02013;2008&#x02019;. This approach enabled the engagement of an international array of experts and safety managers to critically comment on the early drafts of the ICPS. The Delphi survey allowed the original framework, built around existing classifications and theoretical foundations, to be tested against expert opinion. When the views from respondents demonstrated misunderstanding of the framework (e.g. over classes/concepts) or diverged from the initial framework for other reasons, the Drafting Group discussed the appropriate response that both responded to the feedback, but retained the underlying theoretical foundations.</p><p>Limitations include the fact that considerable time and effort were required from participants to complete the survey, although their commitment to doing so is applauded. There was no immediate suggestion of response bias, and although the second round had a much lower response rate, this is not uncommon in a Delphi process.</p><p>Changes were made as a result of the Delphi survey, but this takes us only to the end of the first phase of an ongoing work programme. The framework has been developed on the basis of a range of available classifications, a wide mix of expertise and opinion, enhanced by the Delphi surveys and by iterative discussion, drafting and redrafting. There is likely to be a balance to strike between the comprehensiveness and complexity of the conceptual framework and its ease of use to derive a classification. However, the ultimate test of this comes in its application in practical settings, including the viability of the framework as a practical foundation for classification and coding. This task will be initiated in the field testing phase.</p><p>Several lessons were learnt in undertaking the Delphi survey. The use of a web-based survey platform, with structure and questionnaires designed with Survey Monkey, simplified the process and allowed ready tracking and analysis. The survey instrument was improved by two rounds of piloting. The open-ended questions provided invaluable feedback and enabled in-depth understanding of respondents' views. The second round was essential to test the changes made and did lead to further changes. We would use the Delphi process again, but had underestimated the time required to analyse and respond to the findings.</p><p>In conclusion, this article has described the development of the conceptual framework for the ICPS to the point of field testing, concentrating on the method and impact of a modified Delphi process that supported an expert group to refine the initial drafts. The Delphi methodology serves as both a consensus-building exercise and a consultation process. The consultation gained through the Delphi methodology proved to be valuable and had an influence on recasting the framework and refining the definitions and labels of key concepts. Further refinement will occur following field testing.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Full Drafting Group Membership</title><p>The full membership of the Drafting Group in alphabetical order was: Gerry Castro, Martin Fletcher, Martin Hatlie, Peter Hibbert, Robert Jakob, Richard Koss, Pierre Lewalle, Jerod Loeb, Thomas V.
