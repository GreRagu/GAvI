Protein synthesis involves a complex series of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions which result in the formation of peptide bonds between amino acids, as encoded by the mRNA being translated. The rate of mRNA translation in eukaryotic cells is determined by a battery of mRNA translation factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Kapp1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Efficient proofreading and editing ensure the faithful decoding of mRNA into protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Ibba1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

One of the most widely used approaches for measuring general protein synthesis rate is metabolic labelling, typically in the form of radioactive amino acid incorporation into nascent polypeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Martin1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Rennie1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Overall protein synthesis activity can also be assessed by polysomal profiling, which provides a relative estimate of mRNA loading onto actively translating polyribosomes. In addition, polysomal profiling can be adapted to monitor translation of specific mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Martin1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. These methodologies are useful for analyzing protein synthesis in cultured cells and in relatively homogenous, isolated tissues.</p><p>However, both metabolic labelling and polysomal profiling are hampered by several limitations. In particular, these approaches require relatively large amounts of biological material (cell or tissue mass) and do not allow monitoring of protein synthesis in specific sub-populations of cells or in single cells. Furthermore, they are associated with technical limitations that narrow their applicability. For example, efficient metabolic labelling in simple organisms, such as the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, or in dissected mammalian tissues is technically challenging due to poor intake and uncontrolled or unequal distribution of the label throughout the animal or the tissue. Another source of variability comes from different intrinsic rates of protein synthesis in different tissues and cell types. Thus, significant changes in only specific cells or tissues that amount to a small fraction of the animal mass (such as the nervous system), may be obscured by more massive tissues (such as the intestine or the musculature). Polysomal profiling is hindered by similar issues. Finally, neither metabolic labelling nor polysomal profiling can be used to monitor protein synthesis in live animals.</p><p>We describe here a novel method for monitoring net protein synthesis rates in specific cells or tissues, based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). This approach overcomes the drawbacks associated with biochemical, metabolic labelling methods and allows monitoring of protein synthesis in single cells or tissues, <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although in this study we implement the procedure for monitoring protein synthesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the method can be readily adapted for applications in diverse organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Monitoring <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis by FRAP</title><p>Conventional FRAP applications usually involve highly localized photobleaching of fluorophores, within defined sub-cellular areas or compartments by means of a laser beam, under a confocal microscope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Gribbon1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Jacobson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

This analysis has the additional potential of providing indirect information about organelle continuity and protein trafficking. For the purpose of monitoring protein synthesis, we photobleached GFP-tagged, fluorescent proteins through the entire cell or tissue, to ensure that fluorescence recovery originates from <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis rather than from protein movement. We used animals expressing GFP throughout somatic tissues under the control of the <italic>ife-2</italic> gene promoter. <italic>ife-2</italic> encodes one of the five nematode eIF4E isoforms that functions in somatic tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Syntichaki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Keiper1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. eIF4E is a key mRNA translation initiation factor that binds the 7-methyl guanosine cap at the 5&#x02032; end of all nuclear mRNAs and determines the rate of cap-dependent protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Gingras1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Depending on the application, animals were either moving or anesthetized. Whole animals are then illuminated on an epifluorescence microscope, with a high power light source of the appropriate wavelength depending on the excitation spectrum of the fluorescent protein used.</p><p>By testing different extents of photobleaching, ranging from 5&#x00025; to 50&#x00025;, we find that accurate data are obtained by properly adjusting the duration and intensity of illumination, aiming to attain a level of photobleaching that reduces fluorophore emission down to between 10&#x02013;20&#x00025; of pre-bleaching intensity, without damaging specimens. We observed that depending on the cell or tissue of interest and the fluorescent marker used, a different optimal level of photobleaching may be required, which can be determined experimentally as the minimum photobleaching dose that will quench fluorescence of the reporter to a significant extend, without damaging the organism. Damage was assessed by observing behavioural traits (locomotion, egg laying, pharyngeal pumping, foraging) and reproductive capacity (fecundity and fertility), as a measure of irradiation toxicity. Control animals, where mRNA translation is blocked by treatment with the antibiotic cycloheximide, a potent and specific inhibitor of mRNA translation, were also included in the analysis. Following photobleaching, fluorescent cells or tissues of interest were photographed again and animals were allowed to recover on growth media. Recovery of fluorescence, which is indicative of new protein synthesis, was then monitored in targeted cells or tissues. To monitor fluorescence recovery, animals were photographed at specific time points using appropriate filter sets (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The images collected were used to calculate fluorescence intensity in cells and tissues under investigation, before and after photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004547-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Cycloheximide can also be used to discriminate between the contribution of new protein synthesis and protein diffusion in overall fluorescence recovery after photobleaching.</p><fig id="pone-0004547-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004547.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Transgenic animals expressing p<italic><sub>ife-2</sub></italic>GFP throughout somatic tissues, are subjected to a whole-animal photobleaching session for 8 min that reduces GFP fluorescence down to &#x0223c;10&#x00025; of initial intensity (black line).</title><p>Transgenic animals carry the <italic>rol-6 (su1006)</italic> allele as a co-transformation marker.

An array of protein factors facilitates the tight control of messenger RNA translation.

The best-fit function that describes the recovery phase was generated by regression analysis. The slope of the best-fit lines provides quantification of the recovery rate in a manner similar to that of the conventional radioactive metabolic labelling experiments.

Thus, the ability to determine protein synthesis rates in specific tissues or cells of interest, <italic>in vivo</italic>, within the context of the whole organisms is important for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying differential mRNA translation regulation. We assessed the potential of the method for monitoring protein synthesis in different cell types, in live animals. To compare protein synthesis among different cell types, we followed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, using two fluorescent reporter fusions expressed in specific cells and tissues. The first reporter is driven by the promoter of the <italic>mec-4</italic> gene, which is expressed specifically in the six touch receptor neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Syntichaki2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

To avoid mRNA-specific effects on protein synthesis, both reporter fusions were designed to encode identical mRNAs, solely for GFP, with no other gene specific sequences. We find that fluorescence recovery after photobleaching is faster in neurons compared to muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004547-g004">Figure 4A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004547-g004">Figure 4B</xref>; for representative images of animals analyzed see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004547-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In both cases inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide blocks recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004547-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We observed a similar trend using different reporter fusions expressed in these two distinct sets of cells (not shown). These observations indicate that the rate of protein synthesis is higher in neurons compared to muscles (for additional paradigms, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004547.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004547.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004547.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004547.s005">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004547.s006">S6</xref>).

This method has the potential to allow monitoring of protein synthesis in single cells or tissues with intrinsically different protein synthesis rates (for example muscles vs. neurons or epithelial cells), <italic>in vivo</italic>. Such capacity is not possible with the currently available radioactive, metabolic labelling methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004547.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These methods are exceedingly difficult to implement in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and in live animals in general (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004547.s007">Materials and Methods S1</xref>). They involve hazardous manipulations of radioactive media (initial radioactive labelling of bacteria which are then used as food for worms grown on agar plates), and are confounded by several limitations, such as poor intake and uncontrolled or unequal distribution of the label throughout the tissue or animal. An additional important problem with both radioactive labelling and ribosomal profiling in whole organisms is that results are skewed by the intrinsically different rates of protein synthesis in different tissues and cell types. Ultimately, the contribution of massive tissues (muscles, intestine) obscures effects in small groups of cells such as neurons. This renders radioactive labelling data hard to interpret and ambiguous.</p><p>We have further evaluated our method in various contexts. Protein synthesis rate can be monitored for proteins in low abundance such as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004547.s002">Figure S2</xref>), proteins that participate in highly organized cellular structures such as myofilaments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004547.s003">Figure S3</xref>), as well as for membrane ion channels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004547.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Both transcriptional and translational fusions to fluorophores are suitable for analysis. In addition, proteins localized in specific subcellular compartments are amenable to examination with the present protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004547.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Finally, we have tested the sensitivity of the method by analyzing the rates of protein synthesis of reporter fusions varying in length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004547.s006">Figure S6</xref>). In these experiments we found that recovery is temperature dependent and is slower at lower temperature. In addition, recovery is slower in aged animals versus young adults (data not shown). A relevant factor that also needs to be considered in interpreting the results is the half-life of GFP under the different temperatures and at different ages.</p><p>Our method provides a convenient and versatile alternative to burdensome and crude radioactive labelling procedures, and also allows new functionality and depth of analysis, at the single-cell level. This capacity now enables studies not feasible with conventional radioactive labelling methods, such as comparative analysis of protein synthesis between different cell types, <italic>in vivo</italic>. The role of specific mRNA translation factors in the regulation of protein synthesis in specific cells and tissues, under specific conditions or in specific developmental stages can be studied by assaying fluorescence recovery in mutant animals carrying genetic lesions in the corresponding genes or in wild type animals subjected to RNAi.</p><p>For the implementation of the method, we used two different means to interfere specifically with protein synthesis. First, mutations in i<italic>fe-2</italic>, the gene encoding a somatic isoform of the mRNA translation factor eIF4E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Keiper1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and second, cycloheximide, which is a potent and specific inhibitor of protein synthesis. Both these operations do not affect the mRNA levels of the reporters used. Although the experimental design we followed is based on GFP, other fluorescent markers such as DsRED or other variants could also be used. This flexibility circumvents potential autofluorescence background interference in the green channel due to the accumulation of lipofusin deposits (the age pigment) in the intestine of old animals. The use of red fluorescent reporters eliminates this problem. Because of its simplicity and flexibility, the method is likely to be applicable in a wide range of biological studies, in diverse experimental models and organisms. For example, localized changes in the rate protein synthesis occur during numerous biological phenomena such as learning and memory and in pathological situations such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. The approach described here allows <italic>in vivo</italic> monitoring of such protein synthesis fluctuations, contributing to the investigation of such complex phenomena.</p><p>While, we have used the approach described here to obtain relative information on the rate of protein synthesis in animals with impaired mRNA translation, the method can be adapted to monitor other facets of gene expression such as DNA transcription, RNA splicing, mRNA transport and turnover, and protein maturation. For example, the effects of specific genetic or pharmacological manipulations, targeting these processes can be dissected in a similar manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Nematode strains</title><p>We followed standard procedures for <italic>C. elegans</italic> strain maintenance, crosses and other genetic manipulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Brenner1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Epstein1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Hope1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Strange1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

For worms expressing the fluorescent marker protein globally or in many tissues, we found it more convenient to perform the assay on a plate. In this case, single worms were transferred to fresh 35 mm plates, seeded with OP50 bacteria. A small bacterial spot in the centre of the plate made localization of the worm easier, while focusing the sample. By contrast, when we examined worms that expressed the fluorescent marker in individual cells, photographs of moving worms were hard to analyze. In this case, we spotted a drop of 15 &#x000b5;l M9 buffer on a microscope slide and placed the worm on the drop with the help of an eyelash glued on a pick. Then, we added a cover slip on the top of the drop. The weight of the cover slip was sufficient to keep the worm immobile during the procedure, without damaging it. To limit animal mobility, the mild anaesthetic levamisole that does not interfere with metabolic processes, was also used at final concentration of 1 mM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Epstein1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Hope1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. We avoided the commonly used sodium azide, which blocks the mitochondrial respiratory chain, perturbs energy production and is likely to interfere with the fluorescence recovery process, by hindering protein synthesis. An alternative strategy is to use suitable genetic mutants with limited mobility (uncoordinated, paralyzed). Care should be taken when designing the experiment to avoid genetic backgrounds that are likely to have an effect on protein synthesis. Generation and use of roller transgenic lines carrying the <italic>rol-6 (su1006)</italic> allele as co-transformation marker (plasmid RF4) helped confine animals in a small area of the plate during the photobleaching session.</p><p>Animals were photographed before photobleaching using a camera attached to the microscope (e.g. Axio Cam HR, Carl Zeiss). Images of fluorescent cells or tissues of interest were collected. Imaging parameters such as microscope and camera settings (lens and magnifier used, filters exposure time, resolution, etc.) were documented. All imaging parameters were kept identical throughout the experimental procedure. We performed photobleaching by using an epifluorescence, compound light microscope (e.g. Axioskop 2 Plus, Carl Zeiss, objective lenses: 10&#x000d7;, numerical aperture 0.3 and 20&#x000d7;, numerical aperture 0.5) equipped with a high power light source (HBO 100; 100 Watt mercury arc lamp; Osram, Munich, Germany) and the appropriate excitation/emission filter sets to photobleach the animal (488&#x000b1;10 nm band-pass excitation filter, 515&#x000b1;15 nm band-pass emission filter). For the applications described here 10 minutes of photobleaching reduced the initial emission intensity adequately (to within 10&#x02013;30&#x00025; of pre-bleach levels). The light intensity and the duration of the bleaching period were adjusted accordingly for the specific fluorophore, animal stage and cell or tissue under examination. The appropriate duration of irradiation required to reach an adequate extent of photobleaching, for different specimens was experimentally determined. At least 20 individual animals were processed for each experimental condition. The photobleaching period was kept identical for all animals tested. Proper photobleaching conditions (light intensity, duration) were set aiming to avoid injuring worms. The absolute level of fluorescence reduction by photobleaching is not important. We assessed damage to worms by looking for apparent changes in behaviour such as lethargy and movement defects or diminished responsiveness to touch, and for reduced fecundity in animals subjected to photobleaching. Animals showing signs of damage after photobleaching were excluded from further analysis.</p><p>Each animal was photographed immediately after photobleaching. Several images of cells or tissues of interest were collected. Animals were moved to fresh OP50-seeded NGM plates. To recover photobleached animals on a microscope slide, we added 100 &#x000b5;l of M9 at the edges of the cover slip and slide off the cover slip. These worms were also returned to an OP50-seeded NGM plate for recovery. Recovery timing started at this point. Fluorescence recovery was followed by photographing animals at defined time points. We used 1 hr intervals between successive photography sessions. A suitable time interval can be determined for each experimental application.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Cycloheximide treatment</title><p>In order to verify that fluorescence recovery is due to new protein synthesis we used the antibiotic cycloheximide, a potent and specific inhibitor of protein synthesis. We added cycloheximide on top of OP50-seeded, 35 mm NGM plates to 500 &#x000b5;g/ml final concentration in the agar volume and allowed plates to dry. To kill bacteria on plates before adding cycloheximide we exposed bacterial lawns on NGM plates to UV radiation. We irradiated bacteria at 254 nm for 10 min at 100 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> in a UV crosslinker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Garigan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004547-Gems1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Worms were transfered on cycloheximide-containing plates and incubated for 2 hours, at the growth temperature. After photobleaching, worms were returned in cycloheximide-containing plates during fluorescence recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Quantification of GFP emission and protein synthesis rate</title><p>To determine the average and maximum pixel intensity for each image of fluorescent cell or tissue of interest in the collected photomicrographs we processed images acquired in previous steps with the image processing software ImageJ (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U.

To analyze the area of interest manually, we used the &#x0201c;freehand selection&#x0201d; tool to enclose the fluorescent area. Then, we selected the &#x0201c;measurement&#x0201d; command via the &#x0201c;analyze&#x0201d; drop-down menu to perform pixel intensity analysis. On occasion (area continuity, high contrast ratios), selection of the fluorescent area was done automatically. We selected &#x0201c;adjust&#x0201d; and then the &#x0201c;threshold&#x0201d; command, within the &#x0201c;image&#x0201d; drop-down menu of ImageJ. We adjusted the threshold until the region of interest was marked. Within the &#x0201c;analyze&#x0201d; drop-down menu, we selected the &#x0201c;analyze particles&#x0201d; command. By selecting &#x0201c;outlines&#x0201d; at the &#x0201c;show&#x0201d; drop-down menu, we checked whether measurements correspond to the area of interest. Average and maximum pixel intensity values were collected for each transgenic line and grouped into &#x0201c;Pre-bleach&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Bleach&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Recovery (n)&#x0201d;, where n is the time interval after photobleaching.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were carried out using the Prism software package (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, USA) and the Microsoft Office 2003 Excel software package (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond Washington USA).
