The concatenated sequences of multiple house-keeping genes have been shown to be able to define and circumscribe bacterial species as sequence clusters. The advantage of this approach (multilocus sequence analysis; MLSA) is that, for any group of related species, a strain database can be produced and combined with software that allows query strains to be assigned to species via the internet. As an exemplar of this approach, we have studied a group of species, the viridans streptococci, which are very difficult to assign to species using standard taxonomic procedures, and have developed a website that allows species assignment via the internet.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Seven house-keeping gene sequences were obtained from 420 streptococcal strains to produce a viridans group database. The reference tree produced using the concatenated sequences identified sequence clusters which, by examining the position on the tree of the type strain of each viridans group species, could be equated with species clusters. MLSA also identified clusters that may correspond to new species, and previously described species whose status needs to be re-examined. A generic website and software for electronic taxonomy was developed. This site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eMLSA.net"/> allows the sequences of the seven gene fragments of a query strain to be entered and for the species assignment to be returned, according to its position within an assigned species cluster on the reference tree.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The MLSA approach resulted in the identification of well-resolved species clusters within this taxonomically challenging group and, using the software we have developed, allows unknown strains to be assigned to viridans species via the internet. Submission of new strains will provide a growing resource for the taxonomy of viridans group streptococci, allowing the recognition of potential new species and taxonomic anomalies. More generally, as the software at the MLSA website is generic, MLSA schemes and strain databases for other groups of related species can be hosted at this website, providing a portal for microbial electronic taxonomy.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The methods used to assign strains to bacterial species, and the definition of species, have been much debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There is widespread recognition that the current methods of defining prokaryotic species are no longer adequate and there has been little progress in developing an agreed concept of species that can guide a new definition of species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The current approach for distinguishing species within a genus, and for defining new species, is based on polyphasic taxonomy, which incorporates all available phenotypic and genotypic data into a consensus classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The accepted genotypic method for defining species is based on overall genomic relatedness, such that strains which share approximately 70% or more relatedness using DNA-DNA hybridization, with 5&#x000b0;C or less &#x00394;<italic>T</italic><sub>m </sub>(the difference in the melting temperature between homologous and heterologous hybrids), under standard conditions, are considered to be members of the same species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The cut-off value implied by this definition may not be appropriate for all bacterial populations and in recent years a move away from this cumbersome procedure to other ways of identifying and circumscribing bacterial species has been encouraged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>One approach is to observe the distribution of a large number of strains of closely related species in sequence space and to identify clusters of strains that are well resolved from other clusters. This approach has been developed by using the concatenated sequences of multiple core (house-keeping) genes to assess clustering patterns, and has been called multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] or multilocus sequence phylogenetic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. MLSA has been used successfully to explore clustering patterns among large numbers of strains assigned to very closely related species by current taxonomic methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], to look at the relationships between small numbers of strains within a genus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], or within a broader taxonomic grouping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and to address specific taxonomic questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. More generally, the method can be used to ask whether bacterial species exist &#x02013; that is, to observe whether large populations of similar strains invariably fall into well-resolved clusters, or whether in some cases there is a genetic continuum in which clear separation into clusters is not observed.</p><p>Although there are limitations of the MLSA approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], it is attractive since it should allow the assignment of unknown strains to species clusters via the internet (electronic taxonomy), in a similar way that isolates have been assigned to strains (sequence types) or clonal complexes within a species using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Electronic taxonomy requires the recognition and circumscription of species by the generation of a large initial database (and associated MLSA data) of multiple strains from all of the recognized species within a genus, or part of a genus. It also requires a website and software that allow the sequences from the house-keeping genes of a new query strain to be entered via the internet, and for the sequence cluster (if any) within which the query strain falls to be returned, along with a species assignment for the strain. The approach therefore allows species assignment via the internet and also allows the recognition of the appearance in the database of new clusters, which can be assigned as new candidate species.</p><p>We describe an exemplar for electronic taxonomy (and a generic website) using the viridans group streptococci, since the taxonomy of this group has been, and to some extent remains, problematic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The non-pyogenic streptococci are subdivided into the Mitis, Anginosus, Salivarius, Mutans and Bovis groups, of which the first three are often referred to as viridans streptococci. The Mitis group currently includes the important pathogen <italic>S. pneumoniae </italic>and 12 other validly described species, <italic>S. australis, S. cristatus </italic>(formerly <italic>S. crista</italic>), <italic>S. gordonii</italic>, <italic>S. infantis, S. mitis</italic>, <italic>S. oligofermentans</italic>, <italic>S. oralis</italic>, <italic>S. parasanguinis </italic>(formerly <italic>S. parasanguis</italic>), <italic>S. peroris</italic>, <italic>S. pseudopneumoniae</italic>, <italic>S. sanguinis </italic>(formerly <italic>S. sanguis</italic>) and <italic>S. sinensis</italic>. The Anginosus group includes three recognized species, <italic>S. anginosus</italic>, <italic>S. constellatus </italic>(including two subspecies <italic>subsp. constellatus </italic>and <italic>subsp. pharyngis</italic>) and <italic>S. intermedius</italic>, and the Salivarius group includes <italic>S. salivarius</italic>, <italic>S. vestibularis</italic>, and <italic>S. thermophilus</italic>. All viridans streptococci (with the exception of <italic>S. thermophilus</italic>, which is not associated with humans) are commensals of the human upper respiratory tract and, excepting <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, rarely cause disease in immune-competent individuals. They have been strikingly resistant to satisfactory classification, reflected in frequently changing nomenclature and significant problems of identification by phenotypic analysis and by sequencing of 16S rRNA genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>There is extensive evidence that recombination occurs between closely related Mitis group species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], which can lead to fuzzy species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and may explain some of the taxonomic confusion within this group, and could prevent the identification of well-resolved sequence clusters. However, initial studies of the Mitis group using MLSA have shown that sequence clusters corresponding to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>S. pseudopneumoniae</italic>, <italic>S. mitis </italic>and <italic>S. oralis </italic>can be resolved using trees constructed from the concatenated sequences of six of the seven housekeeping genes used in the <italic>S. pneumoniae </italic>MLST scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Similarly, concatenation of the sequences of four house-keeping genes has been shown to resolve the more distantly related species within the viridans streptococci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], although with four genes there was poor resolution between the strains of the closely related species, <italic>S. pseudopneumoniae </italic>and <italic>S. mitis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the sequences of a set of seven house-keeping gene fragments were obtained from 420 strains, including strains of all species within the Mitis, Anginosus and Salivarius group streptococci, to develop a viridans group MLSA scheme and strain database. A generic open-access MLSA website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eMLSA.net"/> was developed that allows query strains to be assigned via the internet to known species clusters, to as yet unnamed sequence clusters, or as single divergent genotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Amplification and sequencing of gene fragments from viridans group streptococci</title><p>The primers for the amplification of internal fragments of eight house-keeping gene fragments were selected as in Methods (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The primers successfully amplified the eight gene fragments from 326 of the 375 (87%) Mitis group strains that were examined. They also amplified the correct fragments from some streptococcal species outside the Mitis group, including all strains of <italic>S. anginosus</italic>, <italic>S. vestibularis </italic>and <italic>S. pyogenes </italic>that were examined. However, the <italic>guaA </italic>gene could not be amplified from some strains (mostly <italic>S. sanguinis </italic>and <italic>S. cristatus</italic>) and this gene was eliminated to produce the final seven-locus MLSA scheme. The seven selected house-keeping genes could be amplified from all viridans group streptococci that were examined and were at least 40 kb apart on the <italic>S. pneumoniae </italic>R6 chromosome.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Genes and PCR primers used in viridans group MLSA scheme</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Primer</td><td align="left">Gene product</td><td align="left">Sequence (5'-3')*</td><td align="center">Primer length (bp)</td><td align="center">Trimmed fragment size (bp)</td><td align="center">Annealing temperature (&#x000b0;C)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><italic>guaA</italic>-up</td><td align="left">GMP synthase</td><td align="left">ATYCARTTYCACCCMGAAGT</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">567</td><td align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>guaA</italic>-dn</td><td></td><td align="left">CWGGNCCWGGRAATGGTTG</td><td align="center">19</td><td></td><td align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>map</italic>-up</td><td align="left">Methionine aminopeptidase</td><td align="left">GCWGACTCWTGTTGGGCWTATGC</td><td align="center">23</td><td align="center">348</td><td align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>map</italic>-dn</td><td></td><td align="left">TTARTAAGTTCYTTCTTCDCCTTG</td><td align="center">24</td><td></td><td align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>pfl</italic>-up</td><td align="left">Pyruvate formate lyase</td><td align="left">AACGTTGCTTACTCTAAACAAACTGG</td><td align="center">26</td><td align="center">351</td><td align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>pfl</italic>-dn</td><td></td><td align="left">ACTTCRTGGAAGACACGTTGWGTC</td><td align="center">24</td><td></td><td align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>ppaC</italic>-up</td><td align="left">Inorganic pyrophosphatase</td><td align="left">GACCAYAATGAATTYCARCAATC</td><td align="center">23</td><td align="center">552</td><td align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>ppaC</italic>-dn</td><td></td><td align="left">TGAGGNACMACTTGTTTSTTACG</td><td align="center">23</td><td></td><td align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>pyk</italic>-up</td><td align="left">Pyruvate kinase</td><td align="left">GCGGTWGAAWTCCGTGGTG</td><td align="center">19</td><td align="center">492</td><td align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>pyk</italic>-dn</td><td></td><td align="left">GCAAGWGCTGGGAAAGGAAT</td><td align="center">20</td><td></td><td align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>rpoB</italic>-up</td><td align="left">RNA polymerase beta subunit</td><td align="left">AARYTIGGMCCTGAAGAAAT</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">516</td><td align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>rpoB</italic>-dn</td><td></td><td align="left">TGIARTTTRTCATCAACCATGTG</td><td align="center">23</td><td></td><td align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>sodA</italic>-up</td><td align="left">Superoxide dismutase</td><td align="left">TRCAYCATGAYAARCACCAT</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">378</td><td align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>sodA</italic>-dn</td><td></td><td align="left">ARRTARTAMGCRTGYTCCCARACRTC</td><td align="center">26</td><td></td><td align="center">50</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>tuf</italic>-up</td><td align="left">Elongation factor Tu</td><td align="left">GTTGAAATGGAAATCCGTGACC</td><td align="center">22</td><td align="center">426</td><td align="center">55</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>tuf</italic>-dn</td><td></td><td align="left">GTTGAAGAATGGAGTGTGACG</td><td align="center">21</td><td></td><td align="center">55</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*Sequences are shown using the IUPAC codes for sites where degeneracy was introduced.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>For each strain, the gene fragments were sequenced on both strands and trimmed to defined start and end positions.

However, almost all of the clusters contained only one designated type strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Accordingly, the majority of the sequence clusters may be equated with recognized species, that is, <italic>S. anginosus, S. australis, S. constellatus, S. cristatus, S. gordonii, S. infantis, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. sanguinis</italic>, <italic>S. salivarius, S. thermophilus </italic>and <italic>S. vestibularis</italic>.

However, for some species (for example, <italic>S. mitis, S. infantis </italic>and <italic>S. oralis</italic>) that have been affected by changing taxonomy, or difficulties in phenotypic differentiation, there was significant discordance between the clusters and previously assigned species names. The major anomaly was that strains historically assigned as <italic>S. mitis </italic>fell into a number of different closely related sequence clusters, particularly those otherwise consisting of <italic>S. infantis </italic>and <italic>S. oralis</italic>. This anomaly was due largely to strains initially assigned as '<italic>S. mitis </italic>biovar 2' being either part of the <italic>S. oralis </italic>cluster (see below), in agreement with a recent observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], or part of the subsequently described <italic>S. parasanguinis </italic>cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Besides the anomalous clustering of some '<italic>S. mitis' </italic>strains, there were single strains assigned as <italic>S. gordonii </italic>and <italic>S. infantis </italic>within the <italic>S. oralis </italic>cluster, a single strain of '<italic>S. mitis </italic>biovar 2' within the <italic>S. anginosus </italic>cluster and a single strain of <italic>S. anginosus </italic>within the <italic>S. constellatus </italic>cluster.</p><p>The strains within the major sequence clusters correlated sufficiently well with the species names obtained through standard taxonomic procedures, and included the type strain of the species, that each of the sequence clusters was considered to represent a species cluster.

In all cases, further sub-culturing of these strains (labelled in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and re-sequencing of the seven loci gave the same results as obtained initially, ruling out the possibility that the position on the concatenated tree of these strains was due to the use of DNA from mixed cultures.</p><p>One example of an unidentified cluster is provided by four closely related strains (assigned by MK as <italic>S. mitis</italic>) that arose as a distinct lineage from the branch separating the <italic>S. mitis </italic>and <italic>S. oralis </italic>clusters (unknown A in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

The viridans group streptococci were chosen as an exemplar of electronic taxonomy using the MLSA approach since their taxonomy by traditional means has been problematic, with poorly defined species, frequent revisions and changes of species names [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The seven-locus MLSA scheme resolved sequence clusters that were broadly consistent with those expected from the species assignments provided by standard taxonomic methods. Importantly, except for <italic>S. peroris </italic>and <italic>S. oligofermentans</italic>, the sequence clusters included the type strain of only a single species which, in a formal taxonomic sense, defines these as species clusters. The location of the <italic>S. peroris </italic>type strain on a long branch within the <italic>S. infantis </italic>cluster is consistent with the close relationship between these species in the tree based on four loci described by Hoshino et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and with % DNA-DNA hybridization values as high as 62% between some strains of <italic>S. infantis </italic>and <italic>S. peroris </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The lack of any other strains assigned to the latter species precluded any further exploration of the validity of the distinction between these two very similar species, but the species status of <italic>S. peroris </italic>needs to be re-assessed.</p><p>The type strain of <italic>S. oligofermentans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] was within the <italic>S. oralis </italic>species cluster. Similarly, six of the seven individual loci clustered with <italic>S. oralis </italic>strains; the other locus (<italic>sodA</italic>) clustered with <italic>S. mitis</italic>. Sequences of three of the MLSA genes (<italic>sodA</italic>; accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ232554">DQ232554</ext-link>, <italic>tuf</italic>; <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="EU156926">EU156926</ext-link> and <italic>rpoB</italic>; <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ232508">DQ232508</ext-link>) from the same strain of <italic>S. oligofermentans </italic>have been deposited in the nucleotide sequence databases. These genes have sequences identical to those we obtained, eliminating the possibility of any errors in our data on this strain, and the species status of <italic>S. oligofermentans </italic>also needs to be re-examined.</p><p>Otherwise, the major anomaly was the apparent difficulty that taxonomists have in recognizing strains of <italic>S. mitis</italic>; strains assigned on standard taxonomic grounds to this species were found among several clusters, although the major cluster included the <italic>S. mitis </italic>type strain. This problem is largely resolved by the recognition that '<italic>S. mitis </italic>biovar 2' strains are a sub-cluster within the major <italic>S. oralis </italic>cluster, as also suggested by Kilian et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>MLSA schemes using different sets of house-keeping genes should give the same clusters and this requirement was fulfilled, although the resolution between <italic>S. pseudopneumoniae </italic>and <italic>S. mitis </italic>was less clear using the concatenated sequences of the seven genes than with the six MLST genes. The poorer resolution may be a consequence of the method used to ensure that the gene fragments could be amplified from all Mitis, Anginosus and Salivarius group species (see Methods), which may favour genes that evolve more slowly than the average house-keeping gene. This was apparently the case as the genetic distances between clusters was clearly less with the new MLSA scheme compared with the earlier scheme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, the new scheme is favoured as it allows a much wider group of species to be studied, allowing strains to be assigned via the internet to all Mitis, Anginosus and Salivarius group species (and to some other non-viridans streptococci including <italic>S. agalactiae </italic>and <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>) using the initial database of 420 strains. The concatenated sequences of some of these species differed at over 20% of nucleotides and it is likely that the degenerate primers will amplify the seven loci from other closely related streptococcal species, allowing the MLSA scheme to assign strains to these additional species.</p><p>As new strains are added to the database, electronic taxonomy allows the identification of new sequence clusters that can be assigned as new species. Additionally, the mapping of phenotypic characteristics onto sequence clusters provides an important way of exploring the consistency of taxonomic assignments. In some cases this may produce evidence supporting the splitting of a cluster into more than one species. This was evident among the <italic>S. oralis </italic>species cluster where one sub-cluster, corresponding to '<italic>S. mitis </italic>biovar 2', had clearly distinctive biochemical properties, which may be an argument for recognizing it as a separate species.</p><p>The individual gene trees failed to identify the sequence clusters that were resolved with the concatenated sequences, a phenomenon observed previously in an MLSA study of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>S. pseudopneumoniae</italic>, <italic>S. mitis </italic>and <italic>S. oralis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The most likely reasons for the differences in the individual gene trees are either that there were insufficient informative sites to resolve some species using a single gene fragment, or that a history of interspecies recombination has distorted the relationships between species clusters. There was, however, sufficient signal in the individual gene trees to resolve the species clusters using the concatenated sequences of all seven genes.</p><p>Only 16 strains clearly had foreign alleles, which presumably had been introduced by interspecies recombination from another viridans group species. However, the approach used would not detect recombination between very similar species that are not resolved on individual gene trees (which are likely to be the most common events; see below) and, together with the conservative high bootstrap value (&#x02265; 80%) used to define clusters as well resolved, this may have lead to a considerable underestimate of the extent of inter-species recombination within this group. The efficiency of recombination falls off as the logarithm of the sequence divergence between the donor and recipient strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and, as expected from this relationship, where the source of alleles could be clearly assigned, most foreign alleles were from donor species that clustered on the concatenated tree close to the recipient species. For example, the source of foreign alleles in <italic>S. pseudopneumoniae </italic>was <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, and for <italic>S. oralis </italic>it was <italic>S. australis/S. infantis </italic>andIgA1 protease-negative S. <italic>oralis</italic>.</p><p>Interspecies recombination could lead to a strain clustering on the tree away from other strains of the species if the recombinational replacement is from an unusually divergent donor, or there is more than one locus that has received a recombinational replacement. This phenomenon has been found with <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>var Typhi strains, where six of the genes used in MLSA clustered within those of other strains of <italic>S. enterica</italic>, whereas the <italic>purE </italic>sequence was about 6% divergent such that, using the concatenated sequences, the Typhi strains clustered slightly apart from the <italic>S. enterica </italic>cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This potential problem can be recognized using the MLSA website by examination of the individual gene trees and the resident or foreign status of the alleles (and the percentage divergence) in strains that are outliers of known species clusters.</p><p>How do the results described here inform the way bacterial species should be defined? Firstly, the patterns of clustering observed in the viridans group have relevance to any method that attempts to define bacterial species using fixed cut-off values, whether these are based on percent DNA-DNA hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] or average percent nucleotide differences between all shared genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The very different levels of diversity among the different species clusters (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) highlight the difficulties in defining bacterial species using a fixed cut-off value. The advantage of electronic taxonomy is that species clusters can be identified and circumscribed by visual inspection of the tree, without regard to preconceptions about the extent of diversity a bacterial species should have. The diversity of genotypes within some species of this group, and recombination among similar species, could make it unlikely that there will be a single phenotypic characteristic, common to all strains of a species but not to those of other similar species, which can be used to recognize each viridans group species. The requirement for a defining phenotypic characteristic for the official recognition of new species can in any case be questioned as outmoded and unnecessary if these can be identified simply by their clustering on a tree using MLSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Finally, as shown by the unexpected clustering of the <italic>S. oligofermentans </italic>and <italic>S. peroris </italic>type strains, the results highlight how MLSA can evaluate the taxonomic status and validity of proposed or accepted new species and can identify taxonomic anomalies.</p><p>The number of house-keeping loci needed for electronic taxonomy using MLSA is not yet clear, and resolution between species clusters should improve with increasing numbers of loci. However, in practice, the number will be a balance between that needed for good resolution of species clusters and that which allows the generation of large databases and the uptake of the method by taxonomic laboratories. The number is likely to vary depending on the extent of sequence diversity within the group and the extent of interspecies recombination. In groups of species where recombination is very rare, resolution between clusters will depend on the number of polymorphic sites, and the aim of MLSA is to use sufficient genes to obtain enough polymorphic sites to adequately resolve species clusters. For such highly clonal species three or four house-keeping genes may be adequate to resolve clusters. In groups where interspecies recombination occurs, multiple genes are required both to provide adequate numbers of polymorphic sites and to overcome the distorting effects of interspecies recombination at individual loci, by extracting adequate taxonomic signal from the weak signal present in each of the individual genes. Seven-locus MLSA schemes appear to be adequate for resolving closely related species that undergo relatively frequent recombination, such as the viridans streptococci.</p><p>It is tempting with a bacterial group that has been well studied to select for MLSA schemes those genes for which the individual trees give the best approximation of the expected relationships among strains. However, for a general approach to discerning clustering patterns this is unwise, as the expected clusters will not be known when poorly studied bacteria are examined. Initial MLSA studies should therefore use the concatenated sequences of all selected genes to build a tree to identify the sequence clusters. It is advisable when developing MLSA for a poorly studied group of species to select more genes than are needed for the final MLSA scheme (for example, eight or nine genes for a final seven-gene scheme), so that the least informative can be eliminated from the final scheme. The best gene(s) to eliminate can be identified by using the tree based on the concatenated sequences of all genes as the reference tree, and examining the maximum likelihood of each of the single gene trees as a fit to the reference tree, eliminating those with the lowest likelihood.</p><p>Although we have used the term electronic taxonomy, the assignment of strains to known species and the identification and acceptance of new species cannot realistically be automated as it requires the experience, knowledge and judgement of taxonomists. The assignment of species using MLSA for electronic taxonomy should therefore be a community activity, in which those interested in a particular taxonomic group can share their experience and knowledge to provide a consensual approach to deciding whether new sequence clusters should be assigned as new species. As with the MLST databases, eMLSA.net is an actively curated open-access website and submissions of MLSA data on further strains of those species that currently are represented by only a small number of strains will help to circumscribe these species. Similarly, the submission of strains that are difficult to speciate by standard methods may identify new sequence clusters, and submission of sets of strains of other closely related streptococcal species will expand the breadth of streptococcal species that can be assigned to species clusters. Furthermore, those who consider they have identified, using standard taxonomic methods, a new species within or closely related to the viridans group streptococci can perform MLSA and submit the strain(s) to the database to see whether it matches any already in the database or whether, once submitted, new strains that cluster with that of the proposed new species appear as the database grows. Developers of MLSA schemes for other closely related bacterial (or other microbial) species are encouraged to host their data at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eMLSA.net"/> to take advantage of the generic analysis software and to provide a single portal for the electronic taxonomy of many groups of microbial species. A site for the on-line speciation of vibrios is also available <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.taxvibrio.lncc.br"/>, although at present it only identifies the most similar species to a query strain using BLAST, rather than generating the more informative sequence clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The identification of species by electronic taxonomy using the MLSA approach provides a way of identifying species that is as least as valid as any other current taxonomic approach. The clustering patterns from MLSA provide a framework for species definition that can be further validated or revised by mapping on additional phenotypic, ecological or genomic data. Finally, this approach to electronic taxonomy, and our generic MLSA website, are not restricted to identifying and circumscribing bacterial species and could be applied to the Archaea and some eukaryotic microorganisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains</title><p>The Mitis group streptococci studied here included strains (numbers of strains are shown in parentheses) assigned by standard taxonomic procedures (or, subsequently, from their clustering patterns) as <italic>S. australis </italic>(10), <italic>S. cristatus </italic>(5), <italic>S. gordonii </italic>(28), <italic>S. infantis </italic>(24), <italic>S. mitis </italic>(88), <italic>S. oligofermentans </italic>(1), <italic>S. oralis </italic>(84), <italic>S. parasanguinis </italic>(25), <italic>S. peroris </italic>(1), <italic>S. pneumoniae </italic>(51), <italic>S. pseudopneumoniae </italic>(20), <italic>S. sanguinis </italic>(25) and <italic>S. sinensis </italic>(1).

To select additional house-keeping loci, we used the multi-genome homology comparison tool available through the Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cmr.jcvi.org/"/>) to search for proteins present in all available streptococcal genomes that had at least 80% amino acid sequence identity. This retrieved 138 proteins and, from those that had house-keeping functions, the corresponding genes were selected at random and examined for their suitability as candidate MLSA loci. An alignment was produced of the sequences of each candidate locus from <italic>S. agalactiae </italic>NEM3 (GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AL732656">AL732656</ext-link>), <italic>S. mitis </italic>NCTC 12261 (available at J Craig Venter Institute website; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcvi.org"/>), <italic>S. mutans </italic>UA159 (GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AE014133">AE014133</ext-link>), <italic>S. pneumoniae </italic>TIGR4 (GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AE005672">AE005672</ext-link>), <italic>S. pyogenes </italic>MGAS10394 (GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CP000003">CP000003</ext-link>), <italic>S. thermophilus </italic>LMD-9 (GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CP000421">CP000421</ext-link>) and <italic>Lactococcus lactis </italic>II1403 (GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AE005176">AE005176</ext-link>). Degenerate primers were designed for each selected locus, based on stretches of six amino acids that were conserved in all these species, which would allow an internal gene fragment greater than about 350 bp to be fully sequenced on both strands, and in which no indels were found in any of these genomes.</p><p>The pairs of PCR primers were each checked for their ability to amplify the correct gene fragment from a diverse subset of the collection of viridans group streptococci. Those primers that failed to amplify the correct fragment from all of the subset of strains were replaced with primers for amplifying a fragment of another of the conserved house-keeping genes, until a set of eight genes and PCR primers were obtained that allowed amplification of an internal gene fragment of each gene from the subset of strains. On characterizing the full strain set it was found that the primers for <italic>guaA </italic>(and two alternative pairs of primers) failed to amplify the fragment from a small number of strains and this gene was dropped from the final MLSA scheme. The genes, gene products, primer sequences, length of the sequences used in the MLSA scheme, and the annealing temperatures for amplification are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p><p>The gene fragments were amplified by PCR (30 cycles) using, for each gene fragment, a single annealing temperature for all strains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), and were sequenced on both strands, using the primers for the initial amplification, with an ABI 3700 or ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer. The sequences were aligned and trimmed to defined start and end positions using MEGA version 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The trimmed sequences of the seven gene fragments from strains of each species can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://viridans.eMLSA.net"/>. The sequences of the seven gene fragments from each strain were joined in-frame, in the order <italic>map-pfl-ppaC</italic>-<italic>pyk-rpoB</italic>-<italic>sodA</italic>-<italic>tuf</italic>, to generate a single 3063 bp concatenated sequence. Unrooted individual gene trees, and trees obtained using the concatenated sequences, were generated by neighbour-joining or minimum evolution from the proportions of sequence differences between all strains using MEGA version 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The robustness of the nodes was evaluated by bootstrapping (1000 replicates).

This open-access site serves three main functions. It provides a database of all characterized strains of a group of similar species (in this case, all of the 420 streptococcal strains characterized by MLSA), to which new strains can be added by the user community. Secondly, it allows the species assignment of query strains and, thirdly, it allows the identification of alleles that appear to have been introduced into the query strain from a closely related species.</p><p>The database (available to download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://viridans.eMLSA.net"/>) consists of a table containing strain information including, for each entry, the strain name; the species name assigned by MLSA and by standard taxonomic methods (a comment field provides the basis for these species assignments; another field allows the entry of any unusual features of the strain compared with typical strains of the assigned species); the country of origin, date of isolation and source of the strain (nasopharynx, blood, etc); whether it is a type strain; the names and addresses of the laboratories or culture collections that hold the strain; the contact details of the person who submitted the strain data; and any publication relating to the properties or taxonomic status of the strain. Further database tables hold the sequences that correspond to the alleles at each locus.</p></sec><sec><title>On-line species assignments</title><p>To observe the patterns of clustering of the strains in the database, and to show the species cluster into which a user's strain falls, the seven edited and trimmed sequences of a query strain are cut and pasted into individual text boxes. Sequences are checked for the correct length for the locus and the absence of any characters other than A, C, G and T; the submitter is alerted if any entered sequence is of non-standard length or contains unexpected characters. If the sequences are all of the expected length, they are concatenated in-frame, and the query sequence is added to the concatenated sequences of all strains in the MLSA database. To construct the tree, a module of MEGA was used (kindly provided by Dr Sudhir Kumar, Arizona State University), which takes the concatenated sequences and generates in Newick format either a neighbour-joining or minimum evolution tree, incorporating options for a range of genetic distance corrections and for bootstrap re-sampling. If the sequences have insertions or deletions (indels), a modification of the software is used that generates an alignment of the concatenated sequences, which is used by the MEGA module to produce the tree. A module of Phylowidget (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phylowidget.org"/>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]) developed using the visual programming language Processing <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.processing.org"/>, provides easy communication between the tree diagram and the underlying database. Phylowidget is embedded within the website and is passed the Newick file generated by the MEGA module for display as a radial tree (the tree can also be displayed in the standard rectangular format or in circular format). The position of the query strain is highlighted on the tree and, using the intuitive click-drag-zoom interface, the tree can be explored further. Individual gene trees can also be constructed by the same method. A standard database search facility is available allowing details of any strain or set of strains to be viewed, and a search box on the reference tree allows the position of any strain to be highlighted on the tree.</p><p>A species assignment can be proposed if the concatenated sequence of the strain falls within a known species cluster, and it can be assigned as an unknown species if it falls within a cluster with no assigned species name, or as a unique divergent strain if it clusters apart from any of the sequence clusters. In addition, a list of the species names assigned to the five concatenated sequences in the database that are most similar to the concatenated query sequence is shown, together with the % sequence similarity values to these strains (an alert shows if there are less than five strains of this species in the database).</p><p>The tree produced on-line must be the same for all users of the website and only a single tree-building method is employed within eMLSA.net and, as the tree is to discern clustering patterns rather than phylogeny, an unrooted tree is generated and is displayed by default in radiation format, although other tree display formats can be selected by the user. The default settings for the trees produced for a particular MLSA scheme (for example, minimum evolution or neighbour-joining), can be changed by the curator of the scheme to any of those provided by the MEGA module, and one of a number of different genetic distance corrections can be applied. All of the concatenated sequences can be downloaded from the website in MEGA format to allow other types of tree to be constructed off-line, using MEGA4 or alternative tree-building packages.</p></sec><sec><title>On-line assignment of source of individual alleles</title><p>To assign the alleles at each locus in a strain as 'resident', 'resident compatible' or 'foreign', the sequence at each locus of a query strain that has been assigned to species A is compared with all other sequences at that locus, and the species assigned to the strains with the five most similar sequences are displayed (an alert shows if there are less than five strains of the latter species in the database). If the most similar sequences are all from strains of species A, the sequence at that locus is defined as a resident allele. However, if the best matches are sequences from strains assigned to another species, the allele is considered to be foreign, as long as species A and the species cluster assigned for that allele are well resolved on the individual gene tree. Resident compatible is used where the allele sequence is within a cluster of two or more species (including species A) that are not resolved on the gene tree. Resolution and lack of resolution between clusters are guided by the bootstrap values for the nodes on the individual gene trees separating the relevant species. A cluster is defined as resolved if the bootstrap value of the node separating it from neighbouring clusters is &#x02265; 80%.</p><p>To ensure that the assignment of alleles as foreign is dependent on good resolution on the gene tree, a look-up table was generated for each locus, which lists those species that could not be resolved on the gene tree for that locus. For example, only two of the individual gene trees (<italic>map </italic>and <italic>pyk</italic>) could resolve <italic>S. mitis </italic>and <italic>S. pseudopneumoniae </italic>strains (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Thus, if the concatenated sequence of a particular strain was assigned to the <italic>S. mitis </italic>cluster, but it had its five closest matches at <italic>rpoB </italic>with <italic>S. pseudopneumoniae </italic>strains (or a mixture of <italic>S. mitis </italic>and <italic>S. pseudopneumoniae </italic>strains), this would not be scored as a foreign <italic>rpoB </italic>allele within the <italic>S. mitis </italic>strain, as the look-up table indicates that the <italic>rpoB </italic>tree cannot resolve <italic>S. mitis </italic>and <italic>S. pseudopneumoniae</italic>. This result is therefore consistent with the <italic>S. mitis rpoB </italic>allele being a resident allele (resident compatible). Where the best matches are not from species A, but are from two species that are both well resolved from species A (but not from each other), the allele at that locus is assigned as foreign, and the source is shown to be one or other of the latter two species. The website then returns the predicted resident, resident compatible or foreign status of each of the sequences at the seven loci for the query strain (or for any strain in the database).</p><p>For each locus, the website also shows the % sequence divergence of the query sequence from the best-matching sequences. These values identify sequences that are highly divergent from other alleles of the same species, as one or more divergent alleles could result in anomalous clustering of the concatenated sequence of the strain.</p></sec><sec><title>Strain submission to eMLSA.net</title><p>Submission to the eMLSA.net curator of the details of new strains, with their sequences at the seven loci and the original sequencer trace files, and proposed species assignment, is strongly encouraged to build up the viridans group electronic taxonomy database. After checking the sequences for quality and correct trimming, and the proposed species assignment, each new strain and the strain details are added to the database. Submission of viridans group strains that do not fall within the existing sequence clusters are particularly encouraged to allow the identification of potential new species within this group.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CJB carried out the experimental work, DMA developed the eMLSA website, GEJ produced a version of Phylowidget for the eMLSA website, and MK provided strains and expertise in streptococcal taxonomy.
