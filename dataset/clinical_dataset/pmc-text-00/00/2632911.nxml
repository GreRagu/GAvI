In addition to binding regulatory regions of genes in a structure-specific manner, H-NS also binds in a structure-specific manner to sites in the Tn10 transpososome, allowing it to act as a positive regulator of Tn10 transposition. This is the only example to date of H-NS regulating a transposition system by interacting directly with the transposition machinery. In general, transposition complexes tend to include segments of deformed DNA and given the capacity of H-NS to bind such structures, and the results from the Tn10 system, we asked if H-NS might regulate another transposition system (Tn5) by directly binding the transposition machinery. We show in the current work that H-NS does bind Tn5 transposition complexes and use hydroxyl radical footprinting to characterize the H-NS interaction with the Tn5 transpososome. We also show that H-NS can promote Tn5 transpososome formation <italic>in vitro</italic>, which correlates with the Tn5 system showing a dependence on H-NS for transposition <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken together the results suggest that H-NS might play an important role in the regulation of many different bacterial transposition systems and thereby contribute directly to lateral gene transfer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The H-NS protein is a global transcriptional repressor that plays an important role in lateral gene transfer (LGT) in gram-negative bacteria by temporarily silencing newly acquired genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>). In addition, there is emerging evidence that H-NS can directly contribute to LGT by acting as a positive regulator of several different DNA transposition systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10">6&#x02013;10</xref>). In the case of Tn10, H-NS appears to up-regulate transposition by binding directly to the transposition complex (or transpososome) and altering the conformation of this complex in a manner that promotes intermolecular transposition events while at the same time inhibiting self-destructive intramolecular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>). This represents a new role for H-NS and at the present time it is unclear how many other transposition systems are regulated by H-NS via a direct interaction with the transposition machinery.</p><p>H-NS is a highly abundant DNA-binding protein in gram-negative bacteria. It readily forms dimers in solution and can form tetramers and higher order oligomers. H-NS binds regulatory regions of genes and through higher order oligomerization is thought to bring distant segments of DNA together to block RNA polymerase progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). H-NS preferentially binds bent and deformed DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The ability of H-NS to recognize structural features of DNA, as opposed to recognition of specific DNA sequences, may make H-NS particularly well suited to regulate transposition reactions because the available evidence is consistent with transpososomes containing distorted DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">16&#x02013;20</xref>). In the current work we have asked if H-NS binds to and influences the activity of the Tn5 transposition machinery.</p><p>Tn5 is a composite bacterial transposon made up of degenerate copies of IS50 (R and L) that flank genes encoding resistance to the antibiotics kanamycin, streptomycin and bleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). IS50R encodes a transposase protein that interacts with a pair of outside ends (OE) or an OE and an inside end (IE) to catalyze Tn5 and IS50 transposition, respectively. Like Tn10, Tn5/IS50 transposition occurs by a cut-and-paste mechanism that involves a transposon end hairpin (donor cleavage) intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Structure of Tn5 and pathway for transpososome assembly. Tn5 is a 5.8 kb composite transposon encoding resistance to kanamycin (Kan), bleomycin (Ble) and streptomycin (Sm). These antibiotic resistance genes are flanked by nearly identical copies of the 1.5 kb IS50 insertion sequence. IS50R encodes functional transposase (T&#x02019;ase) and inhibitor (Inh) proteins. Outside (OE) and inside (IE) sequences contain determinants for transposase binding and are shown as grey and white rectangles, respectively. Dotted line represents flanking donor DNA. A possible pathway for transpososome assembly is shown below the illustration of Tn5. An OE sequence is shown binding a single molecule of transposase (black L-shape) forming a monomer complex (MC). At this stage the transposase-OE contacts are defined as <italic>cis</italic> contacts. Subsequently, two MCs interact to form a transpososome. This interaction is driven by <italic>trans</italic> contacts between protein and DNA and protein&#x02013;protein contacts. In an alternative model (not shown) transposase is transferred to a transposon end sequence in dimer form after initially pairing two non-transposon end DNA segments. The dimer-bound transposon end then captures a second transposon end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn935f1"/></fig></p><p>The overall frequency of Tn5 transposition is just under one event per 10<sup>5</sup> cells per generation. This relatively low transposition frequency reflects the occurrence of negative regulation primarily at three levels: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) the expression of the transposase gene; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) the expression of an inhibitor protein; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) the formation of the transpososome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27 B28 B29">25&#x02013;29</xref>). With regard to the latter, assembly of the transpososome is inefficient. Tn5 transpososome assembly may involve the interaction of two monomer complexes (MCs), each of which consists of a single molecule of transposase bound to a Tn5 end sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), although there is also evidence for another similar but more complicated assembly pathway (see Discussion section). MC formation is directed by an interaction between the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of transposase and a portion of the transposon end spanning roughly bp 6 to 19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). These contacts are referred to as <italic>cis</italic> contacts. In contrast, pairing of two MCs is directed by <italic>trans</italic> contacts involving the C-terminal portion of a monomer bound to one end with bp 1&#x02013;5 of the partner end. In addition, an &#x003b1;-helix in the C-terminal portion of transposase mediates protein&#x02013;protein interactions between transposase monomers bound to separate ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Prior to DNA binding, the N- and C-terminal domains of transposase have a tendency to interact with each other and this interaction is inhibitory to both MC formation and transpososome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In addition to Tn5 transposase being suboptimal for transposition, the OE and IE sequences of Tn5 are also suboptimal for transposition. A mosaic end (ME) sequence made of a combination of OE and IE sequences has been shown to increase the transposition frequency substantially (12- to 45-fold) by increasing transpososome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>With the above considerations in mind, a highly active <italic>in vitro</italic> transposition system was developed by employing an optimized end sequence (i.e. the ME) and a hyperactive (HA) transposase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). This HA transposase contains three mutations: one at position 372 that prevents the inhibitory N- and C-terminal domain interaction (LP372); one at position 56 that prevents synthesis of the inhibitor protein (MA56); and a mutation at position 54 that enhances the transposase-end interaction (EK54) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). This system was employed to generate X-ray crystal structures of the Tn5 transpososome, which have provided a wealth of information regarding the protein&#x02013;DNA and protein&#x02013;protein interactions that govern transpososome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). These structures, as well as footprinting studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), reveal that portions of the DNA within the Tn5 transpososome have a distorted DNA structure making this complex a potential substrate for H-NS binding.</p><p>We show in the current work that H-NS binds to the Tn5 transpososome <italic>in vitro</italic> and that under certain conditions H-NS can stimulate transpososome formation. We also show that H-NS is able to bind to the MC, an observation that is consistent with H-NS acting at an early stage to facilitate transpososome formation. Finally, we show that <italic>in vivo</italic>, the presence of H-NS stimulates the level of Tn5 transposition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Chemicals and oligonucleotides were from Sigma.

In one arrangement we incubated H-NS, HA transposase and ME DNA (ME+T&#x02019;ase+H-NS) and in another we pre-mixed HA transposase and ME DNA before adding H-NS (ME+T&#x02019;ase/+H-NS). In the former arrangement there is the potential for H-NS to bind either the transpososome or a pre-transpososome MC. We also performed incubations with H-NS and only the ME (ME+H-NS). Also, the size of the ME DNA was varied in different experiments in order to determine the minimal end sequence requirements for H-NS binding.</p><p>The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A show that with a 20 bp ME, H-NS binds to the Tn5 transpososome irrespective of whether the transpososome was formed before or after H-NS addition (compare lane 6 with lanes 7&#x02013;10 and lane 11 with lanes 12&#x02013;15). Based on our titration data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and data not shown) we estimate that a molar excess of H-NS to transpososome of 20-fold is optimal for the formation of the H-NS-transpososome. As the concentration of H-NS present in the reaction increased the mobility of the H-NS-transpososome further decreased, implying that at the lower H-NS concentrations H-NS binding sites within the transpososome were not saturated; note that additional binding sites might be located within the DNA or the protein components of the transpososome&#x02014;the latter might include H-NS oligomerization. Operationally, we refer to the reduced mobility forms of the H-NS-transpososome as &#x02018;supershifted&#x02019; forms. Notably, at the same range of H-NS concentrations used to detect H-NS binding to the transpososome, we did not detect H-NS binding to free ME DNA (lanes 1&#x02013;5). These results indicate that H-NS binds the transpososome with considerably higher affinity than it binds unbound ME DNA. These results also show that a transpososome formed with the least amount of ME sequence required for transposase binding (20 bp) contains sufficient determinants for H-NS binding. ME DNA was also substituted in these reactions with an authentic OE DNA substrate and similar H-NS binding was observed (data not shown).</p><p>Similar results were obtained with a 53 bp substrate containing 40 bp of ME DNA and 13 bp of flanking donor DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), although for this substrate there is some indication that the order of H-NS addition did have an impact on the amount of H-NS-transpososome formed. When ME DNA, transposase and H-NS were added at the same time there was as much as a 2-fold increase in the amount of H-NS-transpososome formed versus when H-NS was added after ME and transposase (compare lanes 7&#x02013;8 and 12&#x02013;13 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). This raises the possibility that H-NS is capable of binding the MC and facilitating transpososome assembly (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, there was a significant reduction in the ability of H-NS to bind a transpososome formed with the 53 bp ME DNA containing mutations at positions 3 and 6 (compare lanes 4&#x02013;6 to 10&#x02013;12 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Positions 3 and 6 have been shown to contribute to <italic>trans</italic> contacts with transposase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) and accordingly we found that these mutations reduce the amount of transpososome formed by about 50%. That these mutations reduce the binding of H-NS to the transpososome is suggestive of the region immediately adjacent to the transposon terminus (i.e. where <italic>trans</italic> contacts occur with the transposase) providing important determinants for H-NS binding.</p><p>A mutant form of H-NS (P116S H-NS) has been identified that has lost the capacity to bind DNA in a structure-specific manner but retains non-specific DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). We used this mutant to ask if H-NS binding to the Tn5 transpososome involves a DNA structure-specific interaction between H-NS and the transpososome. We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D that P116S H-NS has a greatly reduced binding affinity for the Tn5 transpososome, as even at the highest concentration of P116S H-NS used (500-fold molar excess relative to the transpososome), only a small mobility shift was observed (compare lanes 2 and 13); this species has a greater gel mobility relative to the H-NS-transpososome generated with wild-type H-NS (lane 4) and is only observed at high H-NS concentrations (&#x02a7e;5 &#x003bc;M) in our standard reaction conditions. This result supports the idea that H-NS recognizes specific structural determinants in the Tn5 transpososome that are not present in the unbound ME DNA. An analogous experiment in the Tn10 system led to the same conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Hydroxyl radical footprinting of H-NS-transpososomes</title><p>We characterized the protein&#x02013;DNA contacts within the H-NS-transpososome by performing hydroxyl radical DNA footprinting as described in the &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section. Incorporation of H-NS into the transpososome significantly altered the hydroxyl radical footprint as regions of hydroxyl radical protection typically observed in the transpososome were expanded, and regions of hypersensitivity were protected from cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). In our transpososome footprint there are two zones of protection attributable to transposase: zone A includes nucleotides 3&#x02013;7 on the TS and nucleotides 2&#x02013;7 on the NTS; zone B includes nucleotides 12&#x02013;16 on the TS and nucleotides 14&#x02013;17 on the NTS. As well, residues 2-(-1) and 9&#x02013;11 on the TS show hypersensitivity to hydroxyl radicals. These results match well with the results of previously reported hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments performed on the Tn5 transpososome and contact data inferred from the Tn5 transpososome crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). In the H-NS-transpososome footprints, protection in zone A was extended in both directions to include residues 3-(-4) and 8&#x02013;9 on the TS and 8&#x02013;11 on the NTS. This includes loss of hydroxyl radical hypersensitivity at residues 2-(-1) and residue 9 of the TS. In addition, protection in zone B was extended from residues 17&#x02013;18 on the TS. Overall, the footprinting data suggests that H-NS may have as many as three distinct binding sites within the transpososome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Notably, estimates from stoichiometric analysis of the H-NS-transpososome formed at 1.4 &#x003bc;M H-NS (similar to the H-NS-transpososome formed for each footprint shown in lanes 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) suggest that at least four dimers of H-NS may be present per transpososome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn935/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>).<fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Hydroxyl radical footprinting of H-NS-transpososomes.

Samples in lanes 3 and 4 were from H-NS-transpososome assembly reactions performed with 0.6 and 1.8 &#x003bc;M H-NS, respectively (these reflect the H-NS mobility shifts of lanes 8 and 10, respectively in Figure 2B).

This led us to speculate that H-NS might increase the efficiency of transpososome formation. We also reasoned that it might be difficult to observe a strong effect of H-NS on transpososome assembly under our standard reaction conditions because the <italic>in vitro</italic> Tn5 system has been optimized for transpososome assembly (see Introduction section). We therefore asked if H-NS might have a more substantial impact on transpososome assembly under conditions where it is more difficult for the transpososome assembly to take place.</p><p>One way we reduced the efficiency of transpososome formation was by performing assembly reactions in the presence of heparin, a low molecular weight polyanion. Heparin is expected to compete with the ME DNA for binding of transposase and therefore its addition should reduce transpososome formation. Consistent with this expectation, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A that addition of heparin reduced transpososome formation by 22-fold (compare lanes 3 and 10). Importantly, when the identical reaction was carried out in the presence of H-NS, the efficiency of transpososome formation was greatly increased. At the highest concentration of H-NS used, transpososome formation was increased 11-fold relative to the heparin-treated sample that did not receive H-NS (compare lanes 10 and 14). In contrast, in the absence of heparin the increase in transpososome formation was less than 2-fold (compare lanes 3 and 7). Moreover, the vast majority of the transpososome detected in reactions with heparin were in the H-NS-bound form. This is suggestive of H-NS increasing transpososome assembly by binding directly to the transpososome (as opposed to titrating out heparin and thus acting in an indirect manner).<fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Effect of H-NS on transpososome formation under heparin challenge conditions or in the presence of MA/LP transposase. In (<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) transpososome assembly reactions were carried out with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 53 bp ME substrate following the &#x02018;ME+T&#x02019;ase+H-NS&#x02019; regimen, in the presence and absence of heparin. Note that in (B) either H-NS or StpA were added to the reactions. The same reaction set-up was used in (<bold>C</bold>) except that in addition, the ME3/6 substrate described in Figure 2C was used. (<bold>D</bold>) H-NS was added to transpososome assembly reactions carried out with HA transposase and MA/LP transposase (MA/LP). Species are labeled as in Figure 2. (StpA-T'some) StpA transpososome.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn935f4"/></fig></p><p>Further evidence that H-NS is acting directly to increase transpososome formation comes from two additional experiments. In one experiment, we used StpA instead of H-NS to look for stimulation of transpososome assembly in the presence of heparin. StpA is a paralogue of H-NS, sharing 58% amino acid identity in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). However, StpA is more basic than H-NS with a predicted pI of 9.08 compared to 5.25 for H-NS, and thus is expected to bind significantly more heparin relative to H-NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). If an increase in transpososome formation was simply the result of H-NS titrating heparin out of the reaction, then StpA should be more effective than H-NS at promoting transpososome formation. However, when StpA was added instead of H-NS, only a moderate increase in transpososome formation was observed (3-fold as opposed to 17-fold when H-NS was used in this experiment), suggesting that the H-NS effect is direct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). It is likely that the relatively small StpA enhancement in transpososome formation observed in this experiment is indirect because only a small percentage (approximately 5%) of the transpososome formed in the StpA reaction was in an StpA-bound form.</p><p>In a second experiment we asked if H-NS could rescue transpososome formation in a reaction where ME3/6 (described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C) was used as substrate. Recall that the ME3/6 transpososome was largely defective for binding H-NS. We failed to see a significant increase in transpososome formation (&#x0003c;2-fold) in this reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), suggesting that H-NS binding to the transpososome is required for the stimulation in transpososome formation seen in the presence of H-NS under heparin competition conditions.</p><p>An alternative approach to reducing the efficiency of transpososome formation was to utilize a form of transposase that contains the wild-type residue at position 54, but still contains the MA56 and LP372 mutations, hereafter referred to as MA/LP transposase. The glutamate at position 54 hinders transposase-end interactions and impedes transpososome formation. The efficiency of transpososome assembly was reduced 3-fold when this form of transposase was used (compare lanes 1 and 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). In the presence of H-NS the efficiency of transpososome formation in the MA/LP reaction was increased by up to 2.5-fold (compare lanes 3 and 6), which coincided with the formation of H-NS-transpososome.</p><p>Taken together, the results in this section show that H-NS can stimulate transpososome formation and that this stimulation correlates with H-NS binding to the transpososome. It is also apparent that the region where transposase makes contacts in <italic>trans</italic> with the ME is not only critical for H-NS binding but also important in H-NS-directed stimulation of transpososome formation.</p><p>The above stimulation of transpososome formation by H-NS is only functionally significant if the H-NS bound form of the transpososome is capable of undergoing the chemical steps in transposition. We tested this by adding MgCl<sub>2</sub> to a reaction equivalent to that shown in lane 14 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A (i.e. a transpososome assembly reaction carried out in the presence of heparin and H-NS). Upon incubating this reaction for varying amounts of time and then analyzing the DNA on a denaturing gel, we detected the expected distribution of transposon excision products (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn935/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>). Furthermore, the efficiency of excision product formation, per amount of transpososome formed, was comparable with that observed in a control reaction performed without heparin and H-NS. Thus, we conclude that H-NS does not have an inhibitory effect on transposon excision in the Tn5 system.</p></sec><sec><title>H-NS binds to a Tn5 MC</title><p>We can think of two general ways in which H-NS could promote transpososome formation in the Tn5 system. H-NS might increase the stability of the transpososome or it might play a role in transpososome assembly. The latter possibility is much more likely because the Tn5 transpososome is very stable and over the time course of our experiments is not expected to dissociate to any significant degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). We have tested the idea that H-NS facilitates transpososome assembly by asking if H-NS binds to the MC, a species that may either be a bona fide assembly intermediate or closely resemble such an intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and see &#x02018;Discussion&#x02019; section). Under standard <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction conditions the MC is unstable and thus difficult to work with. In fact, analysis of this species requires the utilization of a mutant form of transposase (&#x00394;369 EK/MA) that lacks 108 amino acids from the C-terminus, which includes the dimerization subdomain, and cannot go on to form a transpososome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Importantly, formation of the MC with &#x00394;369 EK/MA displays many of the DNA sequence requirements for transpososome formation and thus provides a reasonable model for the study of a transpososome precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>In assembly reactions with &#x00394;369 EK/MA a MC is readily detected (lane 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Addition of H-NS to the &#x00394;369 EK/MA MC resulted in a mobility shift, clearly showing that H-NS is able to bind this species. At the lower H-NS concentrations the H-NS bound form of the complex constitutes a heterogeneous mixture of species as indicated by the presence of a smear above the MC (lanes 5&#x02013;8). At the highest H-NS concentration (lane 9) there is a dramatic shift in the distribution of H-NS-bound MC towards a more homogeneous species. Given the extent of the mobility shift, which is almost as large as that observed for the transpososome versus free ME DNA (compare lanes 9 and 2), and the concentration-dependence of this shift, it is likely that H-NS is forming higher order oligomers in this complex. Notably, H-NS binding to the MC occurs at concentrations of H-NS that appear to be insufficient to form a complex with the unbound ME. This implies that the MC has binding determinants for H-NS that are not present in unbound ME DNA. Consistent with this, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B that P116S H-NS failed to bind to the MC.<fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays of transpososomes formed with &#x00394;369 EK/MA transposase and H-NS.

Characterization of the H-NS interaction with the transpososome by DNA footprinting analysis provided evidence that H-NS binds in very close proximity to transposase and stoichiometric analysis indicated that up to four H-NS dimers can bind the transpososome. H-NS binding to the Tn5 transpososome was shown to affect the <italic>in vitro</italic> transposition reaction in a positive way. Under conditions where transpososome formation was rendered suboptimal, the presence of H-NS increased the yield of transpososome formed and this transpososome was shown to be catalytically competent. H-NS was also shown to bind a MC, raising the possibility that this host factor can act early in the transpososome assembly process. Finally, we have shown genetically that H-NS has the potential to act as a positive regulator of Tn5 transposition <italic>in vivo</italic> as the frequency of Tn5 transposition was reduced in an <italic>hns</italic> disruption strain.</p><sec><title>H-NS interactions with the transpososome</title><p>We used EMSA to show that H-NS binds preferentially to the Tn5 transpososome. At H-NS concentrations that did not significantly affect the mobility of ME DNA, we saw a full shift in the transpososome to a form with a lower electrophoretic mobility. We examined the determinants for H-NS binding to the transpososome by increasing the ME DNA size and adding flanking donor DNA. We observed that H-NS did not require the presence of flanking donor DNA in the transpososome in order to bind, but did require the presence of at least 20 bp of ME DNA (i.e. the minimum amount of transposon required for transpososome formation). Given that transposase makes contacts over most of the ME sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), this observation suggested that H-NS must be in close association with transposase in the context of the transpososome, an inference that was confirmed by DNA footprinting studies. We observed an expansion of the &#x02018;transposase footprint&#x02019; when H-NS was incorporated into the transpososome, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B. We infer from this data that there may be as many as three distinct H-NS binding sites within the transpososome (listed as sites 1&#x02013;3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Site 1 includes residues (-4) to 2 of the TS (i.e. the proximal region of zone A), site 2 includes residues 5&#x02013;9 of the TS and 8&#x02013;11 of the NTS (i.e. the distal region of zone A), and site 3 includes residues 15 to 18 of the TS (i.e. the distal region of zone B). Interestingly, there is evidence that all three of these potential H-NS binding sites include DNA with a distorted structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Site 1 includes a DNA kink between residues 1 and 2 and work from solution studies revealed hydroxyl radical hypersensitivity extending into the flanking donor DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Site 2 is immediately adjacent to a 41&#x000b0; bend in the helical axis of the DNA between residues 11&#x02013;12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Site 3 is coincident with a second region of hydroxyl radical hypersensitivity that extends from residues 16&#x02013;20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). This correspondence of potential H-NS binding sites inferred from footprinting studies with regions of deformed DNA structure fits well with the known preference of H-NS binding to deformed DNA structures.<fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Three-dimensional representation of the Tn5 transpososome with potential H-NS binding sites indicated.

Interestingly, the hydroxyl radical protection pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) is consistent with H-NS binding in both the major and minor groove in different segments of transpososome. Notably, it remains controversial as to whether H-NS binds to the major or the minor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>), although we have previously detected H-NS binding to the Tn10 transpososome using a minor groove-specific DNA footprinting reagent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). A possible complicating factor in the current analysis is that by binding immediately adjacent to transposase, or possibly interacting with transposase, as has been shown in the Tn10 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), H-NS may change the contacts transposase makes with the Tn5 end DNA. Thus, at this point we do not know if specific hydroxyl radical protections shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> are a consequence of only H-NS contacts. Additional studies will be required to sort out the mode of H-NS binding in the Tn5 transpososome.</p><p>H-NS also bound with high specificity to a Tn5 MC formed with ME DNA and the &#x00394;369 EK/MA transposase. The fact that H-NS selectively bound the MC suggests that H-NS is not restricted to binding the fully assembled transpososome in the Tn5 system. We infer that transposase binding to the ME is likely sufficient to generate determinants for H-NS binding that are not present in free ME DNA. However, at this point it is unclear if the potential H-NS binding determinants described above for the transpososome are also present in the MC. Nevertheless, our finding that P116S H-NS failed to bind the MC and the transpososome with high specificity reinforces our conclusion that deformed DNA structures constitute important H-NS binding determinants in both complexes.</p><p>We found that one of the potential H-NS binding sites (Site 1) was critical for H-NS binding to the transpososome. When positions 3 and 6 of the ME DNA were mutated, we noted a small decrease in transpososome levels formed, however these mutations significantly reduced H-NS binding to the transpososome. While we have not yet determined if both mutations are necessary to prevent H-NS binding, it is intriguing that at least one mutation (bp 3) is at a position expected to be part of a distorted DNA structure. It is also interesting that mutations within only one of the three potential H-NS binding sites would significantly abrogate H-NS binding to the transpososome. One possible explanation for this is that H-NS binding to the proximal portion of zone A affects the conformation of the transpososome in a manner that permits additional H-NS binding events. This would be analogous to the situation in the Tn10 system where it appears that H-NS binding to a distorted DNA structure in the flanking donor DNA portion of the transpososome is critical for additional H-NS binding events within the terminal inverted repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional consequences of H-NS binding to the Tn5 transpososome</title><p>Our binding assays showed that addition of H-NS had a small positive effect on the <italic>in vitro</italic> Tn5 transpososome assembly when the reaction was carried out under conditions that have been optimized for transpososome formation (i.e. with the HA transposase and the ME). In principle, this optimization might render the transpososome assembly reaction insensitive to host factors. With this in mind we set out to identify a means of making transpososome formation less efficient. We found that the addition of the polyanion heparin greatly reduced transpososome formation. Heparin is expected to compete with the ME DNA for transposase binding, thereby making it more difficult for the transpososome to form. At a heparin concentration sufficient to reduce transpososome formation by roughly 22-fold, we found that addition of H-NS resulted in an 11-fold increase in transpososome formation. Thus, under these reaction conditions, transpososome formation became strongly dependent on the presence of H-NS. Importantly, control reactions were included that demonstrated that H-NS binding to the transpososome was a prerequisite for stimulation of transpososome formation in the presence of heparin.</p><p>We also reduced the efficiency of transpososome formation by using a form of transposase that did not include one of the mutations (EK54) that leads to hyperactivity. In this situation there was a 2.5-fold increase in transpososome formation when H-NS was added to the reaction. Substitution of lysine for glutamate at position 54 creates a favorable base-specific <italic>cis</italic> contact with thymine 10 and likely removes an unfavorable contact between E54 and the phosphate backbone at positions 10 to 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). It is intriguing that putative H-NS binding sites 2 and 3 are located within a few residues on either side of positions 10&#x02013;12. H-NS binding to sites 2 and 3 could alter the DNA structure in a manner that prevents the unfavorable contact between E54 and positions 10&#x02013;12 from forming. Alternatively, H-NS binding to these sites may cause a conformational change in transposase that partially shields the phosphate backbone from E54. In either case, H-NS would make the transposase-ME interaction less sensitive to the nature of the amino acid at position 54.</p><p>It is intriguing that H-NS can both stimulate transpososome formation and bind the MC. These observations lead us to propose that the association between H-NS and the MC might assist in transpososome assembly. It is well established that H-NS is capable of forming bridges through self-oligomerization between separate or distantly spaced DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). H-NS-H-NS interactions could therefore help drive the association between two MCs. While it is clear that this type of interaction has a minimal effect on the Tn5 system with the HA transposase, it may be important in assembly reactions carried out with wild-type transposase (see discussion later). Notably, there is evidence from studies on longer DNA molecules (relative to that used in the current study) that transpososome assembly in the Tn5 system may be more complicated than outlined above and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. It has been shown that transposase is capable of synapsing non-transposon end segments and that a transposase dimer formed during this interaction can be transferred to a transposon end sequence. Subsequently, the transposase dimer would capture the second transposon end, thereby forming a stable transpososome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>). As described earlier, H-NS could facilitate the initial pairing of separate, non-transposon end DNA segments. Alternatively, or in addition, H-NS might promote the capture of the second transposon end by helping to stabilize a bend in the intervening DNA between the two transposon ends.</p></sec><sec><title>H-NS acts as a positive regulator of Tn5 transposition <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>We used two different transposition assays to determine if the absence of H-NS has an impact on the Tn5 transposition frequency <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that in the absence of H-NS Tn5 transposition was reduced approximately 5-fold in the papillation assay and up to 11-fold in the mating out assay. These results are consistent with H-NS being a positive regulator of Tn5 transposition <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that is consistent with this positive role working at the level of transpososome assembly. We found that addition of H-NS to an <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly reaction with MA/LP transposase partially compensated for the absence of the EK54 mutation, a mutation that is known to increase transposase binding to Tn5 end sequences. In addition, we found that the fold-decrease in transposition frequency <italic>in vivo</italic> in an <italic>hns</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> strain encoding a transposase lacking the EK54 mutation was larger than in the same strain encoding a transposase with the EK54 mutation. If H-NS acts indirectly to promote Tn5 transposition, it is not obvious why the absence of the EK54 mutation would produce this larger effect.</p></sec><sec><title>A broader role for H-NS in lateral gene transfer</title><p>The work presented here provides the second documented case of H-NS promoting a transposition reaction through a direct interaction with a transposition complex. In the Tn10 system the available evidence is consistent with H-NS promoting transposition by binding to the initial transpososome and ultimately promoting a conformational change in this complex that inhibits self-destructive intramolecular transposition events and promotes intermolecular transposition events. While H-NS appears to stimulate Tn5 transposition by a different mechanism, the common thread in the two systems is that H-NS binds selectively to transpososomes and this raises the possibility that the activity of many other transposition systems may be modulated by H-NS. If this turns out to be the case, then H-NS would play an even broader role in lateral gene transfer than has previously been predicted through the xenogeneic silencing model because transposons are major drivers of lateral gene transfer.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn935/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Canadian Institutes of Health Research (FRN 11281 to D.B.H.); NSERC CGS M studentship (to C.R.W.).
