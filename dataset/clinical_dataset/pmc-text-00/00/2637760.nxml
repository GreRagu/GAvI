Base-pair complementarity could be demonstrated between the seed sequence of a subset of human microRNAs and Alu repeats that are integrated parallel (sense) in mRNAs. The most common target site coincides with the evolutionary most conserved part of Alu. A primate-specific gene cluster on chromosome 19 encodes the majority of miRNAs that target the most conserved sense Alu site. The individual miRNA genes within this cluster are flanked by an Alu-LINE signature, which has been duplicated with the clustered miRNA genes. Gene duplication events in this locus are supported by comparing repeat length variations of the LINE elements within the cluster with those in the rest of the chromosome. Thus, a dual relationship exists between an evolutionary young miRNA cluster and their Alu targets that may have evolved in the same time window. One hypothesis for this dual relationship is that these miRNAs could protect against too high rates of duplicative transposition, which would destroy the genome.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alu is the most abundant short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) of the human genome, occupying 10&#x00025; of the genome content with a copy number estimated to be at least 1.3 million. It is anticipated that the Alu integration rate has been variable over time and is nowadays at less than 1&#x00025; of the rates encountered 40 million years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Deininger1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Extensive Alu transpositions were probably required to be fixed in a breeding population. It was determined that a minimum of 2n insertions allow one insertion to be fixed in a breeding population of n individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Deininger2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. A balance must exist, however, between selfish expansion of the repeat and catastrophic destruction of the host genome. Therefore only the repeat elements that evolved mechanisms to control their own amplification rate in order to minimize deleterious effects on the host, will be efficient in the long run to amplify <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Deininger2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we propose a model for such a self-controlling mechanism, involving Alu repeats and microRNAs. Alu multiplies when an active Alu element is transcribed and the encoded RNA is integrated at a new target site. Some of these integrations occur in exons of protein-encoding genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Yulug1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, both parallel and anti-parallel to the transcription unit (henceforth called sense and antisense, respectively). Sense and antisense Alu integration occurs also in the proximity of microRNAs (miRNAs), as miRNAs can be co-transcribed in long primary transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Borchert1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>MicroRNAs are 19 to 22 nucleotide long non-coding RNAs that influence gene expression by repressing translation or by causing mRNA degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Bartel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-ValenciaSanchez1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

That miRNAs could interact with repetitive elements was proposed by showing that a number of miRNA-encoding genes contain at the 5&#x02032;-end seed sequences that are complementary to Alu sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Smalheiser1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Daskalova1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The relationship between Alu sequences and miRNAs was recently extended by work from Zhang and colleagues, who showed that 7 miRNA pairs of a miRNA cluster on Chr19 (C19MC) are linked to Alu repeats which facilitated the expansion of C19MC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Zhang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. This model shows similarities with our research work.</p><p>Here, we propose that C19MC is the result of duplications of one repeat core cassette containing one miRNA and four repeats. Comparing variations of repeat characteristics of the C19MC region to the entire sequence of Chr19 supports this. On the basis of the sense Alu target selection of the miRNAs in C19MC and the role that Alu fulfilled in the growth of C19MC, a model of dual relationship between Alu elements and miRNAs can be proposed. At a time of high Alu transposition activity, Alu facilitated growth of the miRNA cluster, which by its targeting properties influenced the life cycle of Alu so that duplication rates declined.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sense but not antisense Alu sequences are enriched in miRNA target sites</title><p>As an initial exploration of the relationship between Alu and miRNA, we analyzed miRNA 5&#x02032;-end seed complementary to Alu sequences. For this initial screen all human miRNAs listed in miRBase 10.0 were selected. We limited our search to perfect seed matches, for the following three reasons: First, previous studies indicated that the most essential binding nucleotides defining the targets of a miRNA (the so called &#x0201c;seed&#x0201d;) are located at bases 2&#x02013;8 of the mature miRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Parker1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Yuan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, second most current target prediction algorithms rely heavily on this seed sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-John1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Lewis1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, and last the conservative nature of this approach. We looked at Alu elements in sense and anti-sense orientation as depending on the strand of integration either one of the two possible orientations can manifest in a transcript.</p><p>We first looked for miRNAs having perfect seed complementary sites (nucleotides 1&#x02013;8 and 2&#x02013;9) to sequences within three sequence collections, extracted from the RefSeq collection of mature human mRNAs: i) sense Alu-elements, ii) antisense Alu-elements and iii) Alu-depleted mRNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004456-g001">Figure 1A&#x02013;F</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref>). This led to the observations that the majority of miRNAs did not show a single hit against the Alu sequences and that a limited number of miRNAs showed more than 1000 hits per megabase against sense Alu sequences. To test whether this enrichment might be a result of selective pressure, we performed several controls which indicated that miRNAs having a high hit rate in sense Alu sequences and having a low rate in antisense Alu sequences is neither explained by chance nor by sequence bias (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004456.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004456-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004456.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Frequency of target sites per miRNA (A&#x02013;F) in Alu-containing human transcripts.</title><p>The depicted frequency is normalized to 1 megabase of sequence. All RefSeq non-redundant human transcripts containing at least one Alu repeat (or a fragment of an Alu repeat) in the mature transcript were used here, separating Alu sequences in the sense orientation (green), Alu sequences in the antisense orientation (yellow) and mRNAs depleted of Alu sequences (black).

Most prominent in these graphs was the region of nucleotide 34&#x02013;37 in the sense Alu sequence, as this is both the least variable area (identical in all Alu subfamilies), and a target hotspot for 17 miRNA seeds (each &#x0223c;900 &#x0201c;hits&#x0201d; per miRNA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004456-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Other hotspots for miRNA seeds that had a high frequency (&#x0003e;250 &#x0201c;hits&#x0201d;; asterisks <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004456-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), were centered at nucleotide positions 72, 107, 171 and 245, also coinciding with conserved areas of sense Alu. Thus, 9 out of 10 sense Alu target sites that have over 250 &#x0201c;hits&#x0201d;, have a miRNA that is directed against evolutionary conserved Alu sequence. This is in sharp contrast to antisense Alu sequences, where out of 12 sites with a high total frequency (&#x0003e;250 &#x0201c;hits&#x0201d;), 7 correspond to areas that exhibit the highest variability among subfamilies (asterisks <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004456-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Hence, unlike for the sense orientation, where the concurrence of high target numbers per miRNA in well-conserved regions suggests a general Alu targeting strategy, miRNAs targeting antisense Alu sequences avoid the most conserved regions. Generation of miRNAs targeting sense Alu sequences may thus have been a relevant early event in the expansion of the Alu family in primates.</p><fig id="pone-0004456-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004456.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Sense Alu miRNA targets concentrate in areas with minimal sequence variation, antisense Alu miRNA target sites in areas with high sequence variation.</title><p>A sequence window of 8 nucleotides was moved over the sense Alu consensus (panel A) in order to measure (i) the total number of target sites defined by all human miRNAs seeds (both nucleotides 1&#x02013;8 and 2&#x02013;9) (blue line), and (ii) the level of conservation of the consensus Alu sequence (black line), the average conservation as a gray dashed line.

In contrast, when the repeats would not be part of the duplicated cassette a size distribution would be expected. To quantify this, we compared the mean, median and standard deviation of the length of the repeat elements in C19MC to the distribution of the same characteristics in the randomly selected windows of 100 Kb. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004456-t001">Table 1</xref> shows the summary of probabilities (<italic>p</italic>) for SINE and LINE elements in three primate species.

A cassette of 400&#x02013;700 nucleotides holds the miRNA precursor and a region that could resemble a miRNA promoter sequence. Seeing the unusual arrangement of repeats in the region of C19MC we propose that the flanking ALU and LINE repeats belong to that duplicated cassette. To support this claim, we computed a multiple alignment of 38 sequences to what we propose is the common core of the C19MC gene duplication cassette (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004456.s008">Figure S8</xref>). This cassette consists of an Alu element (alignment position (ap) 1290) followed by a short (80 nt) L1M4 element, a miRNA promoter region, the pre-miRNA and two distal Alu fragments. Within the proximal Alu element two distinct subgroups are seen on basis of an alternative central 18 nt sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004456.s009">Figure S9</xref>). The central decrease in L1M4 sequence similarity is explained by the T rich sequence. A third Alu element is found downstream of the two distal Alu elements belonging to the cassette that shows a much higher sequence variation and distinct subgroups within the alignment. Higher sequence variation of the Alu elements was described previously as a marker for gene duplication events. In this model, gene duplication events are facilitated by Alu sequences, so called junction Alus, that duplicated adjacent sequences regardless of their relative orientation and position to that sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Bailey1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence Alu elements in this 3p block of high similarity could have helped to facilitate growth of this miRNA Cluster. Zhang et al.'s work supports this theory describing the role of these Alu elements within the C19MC. Their computational analysis of the cassettes from miRNA 502 g and 520 h revealed a junction Alu at exactly these Alu elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Zhang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Together, a combination of three Alu elements and one short LINE together with the miRNA genes seems to have shaped a gene cassette that successfully grew during primate evolution. The number of cassettes in the cluster varies between different primate species. Of interest is that these core duplication cassettes contain only minus strand Alu elements. In contrast, all miRNAs within C19MC are encoded in the plus strand.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have analyzed several characteristics of the miRNAs and repetitive elements within C19MC. The miRNAs of C19MC showed high seed complementarity to Alu sense sequences. A classical hypothesis for seed sequence complementarity is that the miRNAs of C19MC, like all other miRNAs target mRNAs. Targets for miRNAs encoded in C19MC are listed in different miRNA gene target databases. Many of these targets are involved in signal transduction and nucleic acid binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Zhang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. During our own analysis of miRNA target sites within mRNAs, we found that over 2000 mRNAs contain Alu element fragments with about the same number of sense and antisense integrations. Especially rich in Alu elements were for example Zinc finger proteins, a group of nucleic acid binding proteins. It was proposed a while ago that Alu elements embedded in mRNAs are probable miRNA targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Smalheiser1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Daskalova1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, but this awaits experimental validation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Hasler1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that miRNA targets in mRNAs-embedded Alu elements have proven beneficial for primates in a second stage of development - the reason for acquiring these miRNAs in the first place could have been a completely different one: namely a defense mechanism against Alu transposition. This is in line with our observation that only sense but not antisense Alu sequences are targeted at high frequencies, but both Alu versions are kept with equal numbers in exons and are therefore encoded in mature mRNAs.</p><p>C19MC is one of the imprinted loci that contain small non-protein coding RNA genes, which are considered important for cell fate decisions in the early embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Royo1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with this idea, are the miRNA genes of C19MC highly and specifically expressed in placenta and some also in testis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004456.s010">Figure S10</xref>), suggesting their role in Alu surveillance. In contrast, other miRNA genes with seed sequences against sense Alu, but encoded outside C19MC, are more widely expressed. Thus, from these expression data it can be proposed that the evolutionary young miRNA gene cluster C19MC plays a role in guarding against deleterious effects of Alu on the genome. The fact that a subset of miRNAs of C19MC is also highly expressed in testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Landgraf1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> is of particular interest, as at least one in every 50 sperm cells was estimated to be subject to a retrotransposition event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Deininger2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Ostertag1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. This expression pattern is compatible with a surveillance role of the miRNAs of C19MC to prevent catastrophic Alu duplications in germline cells. Specific interaction between two mammalian miRNA's and a retroposon-like non-coding RNA (RTL1) have already been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Seitz2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This work described a repeated gene duplication cassette containing a miRNA and four repeats that resemble a miRNA cluster on Chr19. Clustered miRNAs can be transcribed in polycistronic transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-He1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. A polycistronic transcript of C19MC would hold several Alu elements, as three of four repeats per duplicated cassette are Alu elements. Only 20&#x00025; of all Alu element integrations within the C19MC are plus strand integrations, the same strand as miRNAs within C19MC are integrated. Eighty percent however are minus strand Alu integrations that were mainly gained by the core miRNA gene duplication cassette. Therefore most Alu will be found in a primary miRNA transcript as an antisense Alu, a sequence that can be targeted by the miRNAs encoded within this cluster. This may be relevant, as a primary transcript encoding both miRNAs that target sense Alu and the sense target in tandem, would titrate its own miRNAs away, preventing the possibility to target the free Alu RNA in the cell.</p><p>However, although sense or plus strand Alu elements are not included in the core miRNA gene duplication cassette, they could still play a central role in sensing Alu activity. Borchert and colleagues showed that sense Alu transcription of C19MC can pass the Alu element and continue transcribing downstream miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Borchert1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The unique design of the cluster's miRNA duplication cassette, as well as the cluster's sense Alu target capacity and the miRNA expression data were the basis to postulate a dual interaction model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004456-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In this model, homology sites of Alu sequences helped duplicating a gene cassette encoding miRNAs, which in turn can target sense Alu sequences and thus alter the fate of free Alu elements. This is of great interest as Alu is a retro-element that can transpose in a cycle containing a free Alu transcript, which is always in sense orientation. This model includes on one hand the fact that 3p-miRNAs of C19MC are enriched in number and production quantity and on the other hand that gene duplication events leading to growth of the cluster was facilitated by minus strand Alu repeats. Because a similar cluster is found in other primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Zhang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Bentwich1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, which share Alu repeats with humans, it can be proposed that Alu expansion and growth of this cluster has occurred in parallel. Because many of the Alu elements within C19MC are evolutionary old (AluJ and AluS), expansion of the cluster may have occurred at an early wave of expansion of the Alu elements.</p><fig id="pone-0004456-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004456.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Model for dual relationship between Alu elements and miRNAs in the C19MC cluster.</title><p>During the phase of rapid extension of Alu copy number, a miRNA containing cassette was duplicated from which the mature miRNA targets free (duplicating) Alu RNA.

On the one hand, duplication events involving Alu sequences contributed to growth of the miRNA cluster and facilitated expression of these miRNAs. On the other hand the expressed miRNAs from the cluster are often predicted to target free Alu transcripts and it seems conceivable that this is beneficial for the host, by preventing catastrophic or self-destructive intensities of Alu retroposition.</p><p>Giving that much of this co-evolution between Alu repeats and the miRNAs of C19MC occurred about 40 million years ago, and that nearly all L1 elements lost transposition capability since then, experimental evidence for this co-evolutionary hypothesis will be hard to find today. Finding a second example of co-evolution between clustered miRNA genes and SINE repeats in another mammalian clade would add further support for this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Selection of Alu sequences</title><p>RefSeq mRNAs (NM_ number indexed) that contain Alu sequences were selected from assembly of June 2006 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>).

Start and endpoint of the aligned sequence region to the human chr19 were corrected not to excise the given window size.</p><p>Repeat elements of C19MC were analyzed by computing their median length and standard deviation. These were compared to the distribution of the same characteristics in the randomly selected windows. A probability <italic>p</italic> expressing how extreme each characteristic is with respect to that distribution is reported. <italic>p&#x0003c;0.05</italic> was considered extreme. For describing distributions, the median was preferred over the mean, since the distributions are extremely skewed, and the mean can be severely affected by extreme observations, while the median is more robust.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004456.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Frequency of target sites per octanucleotide (A&#x02013;C) in Alu-containing human transcripts and frequency of miRNA complementary sites per Alu-consensus sequences (D, E). The depicted frequency is normalized to 1 megabase of sequence. All RefSeq non-redundant human transcripts containing at least one Alu repeat (or a fragment of an Alu repeat) in the mature transcript were used here, separating Alu sequences in the sense orientation (green), Alu sequences in the antisense orientation (yellow) and mRNAs depleted of Alu sequences (black). Possible target sites are defined as perfect matches between octanucleotides and Alu-containing human transcripts, the octanucleotide set consist out of all possible combinations of eight nucleotides. (A): complete frequency distribution; (B) and (C): focused view on the region of the distribution with low and high number of predicted target sites, respectively. Note that a large proportion of octanucleotides does not occur in Alu repeats. X aches indicate bin limits; each bin contains values including the smaller limit and excluding the higher limit (e.g. 0&#x02264;x&#x0003c;5); except the last bin of panel (A) where all values are grouped that are equal to or exceed 100 (x&#x02265;100). Panel D, E shows that a part of the human miRNA repertoire is complementary to the sense Alu consensus sequence. The abscissa shows the number of human miRNAs that target one particular sequence; the ordinate shows the frequency (&#x00025; of all tested sequences) at which this number was observed. Perfect seed matches of nucleotides 1&#x02013;8 (D) and 2&#x02013;9 (E) are taken as predicted miRNA target sites.

In addition, all members of the primate specific miRNA cluster on Chr19 C19MC are listed, as we proposed common driving force for gaining these miRNAs. Further the miRNA family members of miRNA cluster 371 are shown for two reasons. First as this cluster is positioned downstream of C19MC showing that some miRNAs of Chr19 are not highly expressed in placenta; second it was proposed that C19MC originated from miRNAs of this cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004456-Deininger2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. An almost exclusive expression of C19MC miRNAs is seen in the placenta followed by the expression of a minor number of C19MC miRNAs in testis. In contrast miRNAs of Cluster 371 are not detectable in these two tissues. Two of the more ubiquitously expressed Alu targeting miRNAs (miR-93 and miR-17 of &#x0201c;other miRNAs&#x0201d;) are also detectable in placenta. As these are highly expressed in the hematopoietic system it is plausible that the signals detected in placenta origin from blood cell contamination.
