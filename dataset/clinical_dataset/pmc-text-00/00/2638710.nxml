However, it remains unclear how B deficiency leads to various metabolic disorders and cell death. To understand this mechanism, we analyzed the physiological changes in suspension-cultured tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>) BY-2 cells upon B deprivation. When 3-day-old cells were transferred to B-free medium, cell death was detectable as early as 12&#x02009;h after treatment. The B-deprived cells accumulated more reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides than control cells, and showed a slight but significant decrease in the cellular ascorbate pool. Supplementing the media with lipophilic antioxidants effectively suppressed the death of B-deprived cells, suggesting that the oxidative damage is the immediate and major cause of cell death under B deficiency. Dead cells in B-free culture exhibited a characteristic morphology with a shrunken cytoplasm, which is often seen in cells undergoing programmed cell death (PCD). However, they did not display other hallmarks of PCD such as internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, decreased ascorbate peroxidase expression and protection from death by cycloheximide. These results suggest that the death of tobacco cells induced by B deprivation is not likely to be a typical PCD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Boron deficiency</kwd><kwd>Cell death</kwd><kwd>Necrosis</kwd><kwd>Oxidative damage</kwd><kwd>Tobacco</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Boron (B) is an essential micronutrient for vascular plants, and B deficiency is one of the major constraints to crop production worldwide (Shorrocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">1997</xref>). Most plant species cannot retranslocate B efficiently, and therefore require a continuous supply of B throughout their life cycle. The symptoms of B deficiency include rapid cessation of root elongation, inhibited growth of young leaves and reduced fertility (Marschner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1995</xref>). At the cellular level, B deprivation harms numerous physiological processes, including sugar transport, cell wall synthesis, lignification, cell wall structure, carbohydrate metabolism, RNA metabolism, respiration, IAA metabolism, phenol metabolism and membrane transport (Parr and Loughman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">1983</xref>), and eventually brings about cell death (Matoh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">1992</xref>).</p><p>In the last decade, much progress has been made in understanding the physiological function of B in plants. We previously reported that B, as a borate, cross-links two rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) regions of pectic polysaccharides in cell walls (Kobayashi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1996</xref>). Studies using plants with a mutant RG-II structure showed that the B&#x02013;RG-II complex is necessary for normal plant growth (O&#x02019;Neill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2001</xref>, Iwai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2002</xref>, Ahn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2006</xref>), and now B has been established as essential for cell wall structure and function (O&#x02019;Neill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2004</xref>). These findings imply that the primary effect of B shortage is to disturb the structural organization of cell walls. Consistent with this assumption, Goldbach's group has reported that the physical properties of squash root cell walls change within minutes after B deprivation (Findeklee and Goldbach 1997, Goldbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2001</xref>). However, it remains unclear how and why B deficiency, and probably the resulting aberrant cell wall structure, leads to such a variety of metabolic disorders and cell death. Elucidating this process is important for a better understanding of the function of B, and for the development of methods to prevent crop loss due to B deficiency.</p><p>Most previous studies on B deficiency have been carried out using intact plants. However, the interpretation of experimental results is complicated because intact plant tissues consist of various types of differentiated cells which probably differ in their requirements for B. In addition, since only a proportion of the cells in a tissue are in direct contact with the external solution, most cells might remain unaffected when B is withdrawn from the medium. These experimental problems might be circumvented by the use of suspension-cultured cells, as they are uniform and their surrounding media are easy to control. Cultured tobacco BY-2 cells are especially suitable because they do not aggregate significantly, and essentially all the cells are in direct contact with the external medium. Moreover, their death process has been characterized in detail in recent studies (de Pinto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2002</xref>, Vacca et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2004</xref>, de Pinto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>). These features would allow us to dissect the process of B deficiency-induced cell death precisely. Here we describe the physiological changes of tobacco BY-2 cells observed upon B deprivation. The results show that oxidative damage is directly involved in the cell death, but the cells do not undergo a typical programmed cell death.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Boron deprivation-induced oxidative damage to tobacco BY-2 cells</title><p>First we examined the effects of B deprivation on the viability of tobacco BY-2 cells. Three-day-old cultures, which were in the log phase of growth, were used in this study. Cells were washed with medium with or without B, and then cultured in the same medium (hereafter referred to as +B or &#x02212;B treatment, respectively). Cell viability was analyzed by fluorescein diacetate (FDA)/propidium iodide (PI) staining, and a representative result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>a. With +B treatment, dead cells comprised &#x0003c;3% of the total cells throughout the experimental period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>a). In contrast, with &#x02212;B treatment, cell death was detectable as early as 12&#x02009;h after treatment, and the viability decreased to 30% by 48&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>a). When total cells, dead or alive, were counted 24&#x02009;h after treatment, the &#x02212;B culture contained 60&#x02013;70% as many cells as the +B culture did (data not presented). Since the proportion of live proliferating cells in the &#x02212;B culture had already decreased to approximately 80% at 12&#x02009;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>a), and since the doubling time of tobacco BY-2 cells is approximately 12&#x02009;h (Nagata et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">1992</xref>), the &#x02212;B culture would be predicted to contain around 70% as many cells as the +B culture at 24&#x02009;h, if cell division is not affected by the treatment. The predicted cell number is consistent with the observed results, suggesting that cell division was not significantly impaired upon B deprivation. Microscopic examination of dead cells in the &#x02212;B culture revealed a characteristic morphology with a shrunken cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>b).<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Cell death induced by B deprivation.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in &#x02212;B cells, using dihydroethidium (DHE) as a probe. In the presence of ROS, DHE is oxidized to ethidium that intercalates with DNA to emit red fluorescence. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>a&#x02013;d, the ethidium-derived fluorescence was detectable at 12&#x02009;h in &#x02212;B cells, but not in +B cells. This result indicates that ROS accumulated in &#x02212;B cells. We then analyzed lipid peroxidation in these cells as a measure of oxidative damage, using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay. TBARS are the product of lipid peroxidation, and high levels of these substances correlate with high levels of oxidative damage to membranes (Heath and Packer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1968</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>e, more TBARS accumulated in &#x02212;B cells than in +B cells as early as 12&#x02009;h, and the levels in &#x02212;B cells increased even further over time.<fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Oxidative stress induced by B deprivation.

We therefore examined the effect of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), a lipophilic antioxidant that reportedly prevents antimycin A- or aluminum stress-induced ROS accumulation (Maxwell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">1999</xref>, Yamamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2002</xref>), upon B deprivation-induced cell death. Supplementing the medium with BHA at 0.1&#x02009;mM did not affect the viability of +B cells (data not shown). On the other hand, it significantly improved the viability of &#x02212;B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>a). &#x003b1;-Tocopherol, another lipophilic antioxidant, also suppressed the death of &#x02212;B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>b). Although the cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>b were fed with &#x003b1;-tocopherol prior to the treatment, adding &#x003b1;-tocopherol after B removal was also effective (data not shown). These results were not attributable to contaminating B in the reagents; possible B contamination from BHA or &#x003b1;-tocopherol was estimated to be &#x0003c;0.03&#x02009;&#x003bc;g B liter<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, which is far lower than the amount remaining in the B-depleted medium (typically 2&#x02013;5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g B liter<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>).<fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Effect of antioxidant on cell death induced by B deprivation.

We next counted the number of dead cells to investigate the effect of B resupply on cell viability. For this analysis, duplicate cultures were deprived of B, and then supplemented after 18&#x02009;h with either boric acid at 1&#x02009;mg B liter<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> (&#x02018;resupplied culture&#x02019;) or water (&#x02018;&#x02212;B culture&#x02019;). Cells washed with and cultured in control medium were also prepared as a control (&#x02018;+B culture&#x02019;). Cultures that had been deprived of B for 18&#x02009;h (&#x02212;B and resupplied cultures) contained significantly more dead cells than the control (+B culture) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>a). However, during the subsequent 30&#x02009;h, while the number of dead cells increased further in the &#x02212;B culture, it did not increase further in the resupplied culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>a). Resupplying B at 24&#x02009;h gave essentially the same results; the dead cell number was 33 &#x000b1; 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at the time of resupply (24&#x02009;h), and 32 &#x000b1; 7&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> at 24&#x02009;h after resupply (48&#x02009;h). These results indicate that the B resupply immediately suppressed further cell death and allowed the surviving cells to resume proliferation.<fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Effects of B resupply on cell death and the accumulation of lipid peroxides.

However, by 48&#x02009;h, the TBARS in resupplied cultures decreased to the same level as that in the +B cultures, whereas it increased even further in the &#x02212;B cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>b). Taken together, these results indicate that the B deprivation-induced oxidative stress was removed immediately upon B resupply.</p></sec><sec><title>Antioxidants and antioxidant enzyme activities</title><p>We next explored possible changes in cellular antioxidant systems in cells deprived of B. To detect any change that precedes oxidative injury, the analyses were done at 24&#x02009;h, when &#x0003e;80% of the cells were still alive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>a). When compared with +B cells, &#x02212;B cells did not show a marked decrease in the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>a). We then examined changes in the pools of reduced glutathione (GSH) and total ascorbate [ascorbate (ASC) plus dehydroascorbate (DHA)]. The quantity of both antioxidants showed transient increases during the first 12&#x02009;h in both +B and &#x02212;B cells, probably in response to the mechanical stress imposed by the cell washing procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>b). The GSH content of &#x02212;B cells was not significantly lower than that of +B cells at any of the time points observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>b, upper panel). On the other hand, the total ascorbate pool in 12&#x02009;h &#x02212;B cells was decreased by 20% with respect to +B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>b, lower panel), although the ASC redox state (reduced ASC/total ASC) was unaffected (0.89 for both +B and &#x02212;B cells). The change in total ascorbate pool appears rather marginal, but may nevertheless be directly involved in the oxidative damage since resupply of B at 3&#x02009;h restored the total ascorbate pool at 12&#x02009;h to the same level as that observed in 12&#x02009;h +B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>b).<fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Change in antioxidant capacity.

This observation prompted us to investigate whether PCD is also involved in the cell death induced by B deprivation. We first examined internucleosomal genomic DNA fragmentation in &#x02212;B cells, one of the hallmarks of PCD (van Doorn and Woltering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2005</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>a, clear laddering was observed with DNA extracted from heat-shocked cells, a positive control for PCD (Vacca et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2004</xref>). On the other hand, smearing rather than laddering was observed with DNAs extracted from &#x02212;B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>a).<fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>(a) DNA fragmentation analysis.

CHX has been reported to suppress PCD by inhibiting the synthesis of proteins that are required to execute the death program (Solomon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">1999</xref>, Clarke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2000</xref>, Vacca et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2004</xref>, Duval et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2005</xref>). If PCD is involved, then supplementing the medium with CHX should suppress death induced by B deprivation. As a positive control for the CHX rescue effect, we confirmed that heat shock-induced PCD could be suppressed by 0.35&#x02009;&#x003bc;M CHX (cell viability at 24&#x02009;h was 30 &#x000b1; 7% and 54 &#x000b1; 3% in the absence or presence of CHX, respectively). However, the viability of &#x02212;B cells in the presence of CHX (0.35&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) was 70 &#x000b1; 3% at 24&#x02009;h after B deprivation, not significantly different from the viability in the absence of CHX (76 &#x000b1; 2%), indicating that CHX did not suppress the death induced by B deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>b).</p><p>It has been reported that, in tobacco BY-2 cells, different kinds of cell death (PCD or cell necrosis) have different effects on cellular antioxidant systems (de Pinto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2002</xref>, Vacca et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2004</xref>, de Pinto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>). One of the most distinctive differences is that the gene expression of cytosolic APX (cAPX) is down-regulated during PCD, but not during cell necrosis (de Pinto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>). We therefore examined <italic>cAPX</italic> expression as another diagnostic feature of PCD, but found the transcript at similar levels in &#x02212;B cells and +B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>c). Taken together, these data suggest that cell death induced by B deprivation is not likely to be a typical PCD.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report we have described the physiological responses of suspension-cultured tobacco BY-2 cells to B deprivation, and have shown that ROS and lipid peroxides are accumulated in these cells. The results unequivocally demonstrate that B deprivation causes oxidative damage to the cells as a downstream effect. Previous studies have shown that B deficiency symptoms of <italic>Lemna</italic> are exaggerated under high light conditions (Tanaka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">1966</xref>), that the cellular antioxidant pool decreases significantly in sunflower or squash under B deficiency (Cakmak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">1995</xref>, Lukaszewski and Blevins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">1996</xref>, Cakmak and R&#x000f6;mheld <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">1997</xref>) and that oxidative stress-responsive genes are up-regulated in low B-acclimated tobacco cells (Kobayashi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2004</xref>). Although these observations are all consistent with the notion that oxidative injuries occur under B deficiency, none of these reports demonstrated that ROS accumulate in the cells. In the present study, we demonstrated the accumulation of ROS and lipid peroxides using DHE staining and TBARS assays. To our knowledge, this is the first direct proof that B-deficient cells suffer from oxidative damage.</p><p>Importantly, we furthermore demonstrated that B deprivation-induced cell death was effectively suppressed by lipophilic antioxidants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This result indicates that oxidative damage is crucial and immediately responsible for the death of tobacco cells induced by B deprivation. Obviously, oxidative damage is not unique to B deficiency, but rather represents a consequential effect of the B deficiency stress. Nonetheless, the results are significant in that we have demonstrated that the oxidative damage is the major cause of death under B deficiency, and therefore plant cells could be less susceptible to B limitation if the oxidative stress can be circumvented. The results also suggest that enhancing the endogenous antioxidant capacity may be one of strategies for engineering B-efficient crops.</p><p>It is still debatable whether B plays a direct role(s) in membrane stabilization (Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2002</xref>). The premise for this hypothesis is that B deprivation makes the plasma membrane depolarized and leaky (Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2002</xref>). However, given that oxidative damage occurs under B deficiency, the observations of impaired membrane function could be attributed to membrane lipid peroxidation and may not necessarily be the direct effect of B deprivation. In addition, no membrane-associated compound has yet been demonstrated to occur as a complex with B in plant cells. Taken together, we consider that B is unlikely to function primarily as a membrane stabilizer.</p><p>Although the dead cells in &#x02212;B cultures were morphologically similar to those undergoing PCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>b), they did not show other PCD hallmarks such as DNA laddering, decreased <italic>cAPX</italic> expression or protection from death by CHX. The immediate rescue effect of B resupply also does not support the involvement of PCD; if the death had been &#x02018;programmed&#x02019; and initiated in &#x02212;B cells before the morphological changes became visible, then B resupply at 18&#x02009;h, when a substantial proportion of the cells are already dead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>a), would not be able to suppress the subsequent cell death. In contrast, B resupply was found to be immediately effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>b). Taken together, we conclude that B deprivation-induced death in tobacco BY-2 cells is unlikely to be PCD.</p><p>It has been reported that hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) can induce different responses in tobacco BY-2 cells depending on the dose and duration of exposure (de Pinto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>). Under a threshold value, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induces a modest rise in cellular antioxidant capacity, such as the GSH pool and APX activity, as a defense mechanism against stress. On the other hand, higher amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> lead to depletion of antioxidant capacity and either PCD or cell necrosis; PCD is triggered if a higher amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is given in a single pulse, whereas cell necrosis occurs under more prolonged exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In this study, we did not find any marked decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities upon B deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>a). We also found that the extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations were not significantly different between +B and &#x02212;B cultures (data not shown). These data suggest that, in tobacco BY-2 cells, the B deprivation-triggered overproduction of ROS is not high enough to induce prompt cell death. In fact, the death of &#x02212;B cells developed rather slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>a), suggesting a low but continuous production of ROS. In this regard, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that B deprivation may induce more acute damage in some cases. Cakmak and R&#x000f6;mheld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">1997</xref>) reported a marked decrease in the content of ASC and non-protein SH compounds in B-deficient sunflower plants, which was not observed in this study. We assume that the discrepancy reflects the severity of oxidative damage imposed on the cells. In plants, ROS are inevitably produced in chloroplasts during photosynthesis (Foyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1994</xref>). Thus more ROS may accumulate in photosynthesizing green leaves than in heterotrophic cultured tobacco cells, when the redox balance is disturbed under B deficiency.</p><p>In this study we have demonstrated the involvement of oxidative damage in the final stage of B deficiency. What remains to be clarified is why B deficiency leads to the ROS overproduction. Considering that &#x0003e; 98% of B in tobacco BY-2 cells localizes in the cell wall (Matoh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">1992</xref>), and that B deprivation alters the physical properties of squash root cell walls within minutes (Findeklee and Goldbach 1997, Goldbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2001</xref>), it would be reasonable to assume that the B deprivation response begins with aberrations in the cell wall structure. At least two hypotheses could explain the subsequent events. First, when cell growth is arrested due to the inability to organize a normal cell wall, energy consumption would be decreased. This would lead to an over-reduction of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which favors the generation of superoxide radical anions (Purvis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">1997</xref>). A second possible mechanism is overaccumulation of ROS that have been produced as a signal for the disturbed cell wall structure. Ryden et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2003</xref>) demonstrated that the B&#x02013;RG-II complex contributes significantly to maintaining the tensile strength of the cell wall, in studies using the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant <italic>mur1</italic> with a defective RG-II structure. Their finding suggests that if the B&#x02013;RG-II complex is not formed properly due to B deficiency, the cell wall would become weaker and less resistant to turgor pressure. In turn, this could trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through stretch-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the plasma membrane (Nakagawa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2007</xref>), and thereby activate the generation of ROS as signaling molecules (Lecourieux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2006</xref>). Similar events may also occur in deprivation experiments. Since B&#x02013;RG-II complexes are highly stable in vitro (Kobayashi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">1997</xref>), existing B&#x02013;RG-II bonding in pectic polysaccharides may be retained even when B is removed from the medium. However, the mechanical strength of squash root cell walls is reduced within minutes after B deprivation (Findeklee and Goldbach 1997, Goldbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2001</xref>), suggesting that significant changes in cell wall structure occur upon B deprivation. This may be either because the B&#x02013;RG-II bonding in vivo is less stable than in vitro, or because a failure in cross-linking newly secreted polysaccharides is critical. We assume that generation of ROS as a signal is a more plausible hypothesis because we previously found that several ROS-responsive genes are induced within 30&#x02009;min after B deprivation in tobacco BY-2 cells (Kobayashi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2004</xref>). Such a rapid induction is more likely to be triggered by the ROS produced as a signal, rather than the ROS resulting from reduced energy consumption.</p><p>Interestingly, the biochemical changes we observed in the B-deprived tobacco cells are similar to those in the aluminum-treated tobacco cells (Yamamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2002</xref>), in which downstream oxidative stress plays a crucial role in inhibiting growth, and BHA effectively suppresses the damage. Given that the primary target of aluminum toxicity is the cell wall (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2004</xref>), these events may represent a general cellular response to the defects in the cell wall. A plant cell wall is a dynamic and responsive structure which is important for the symplast, not only as a mechanical support but also as an interface with the external environment (Hoson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1998</xref>). The idea is now emerging that cell walls can generate stress signals that induce cell death. For example, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant <italic>cev1</italic> has reduced cellulose content and constitutively expresses stress- and defense-responsive genes (Ellis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2002</xref>), and the inhibition of cellulose synthesis by thaxtomin A or isoxaben induces PCD in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Duval et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2005</xref>). However, research into the mechanism by which the symplast senses defects in the cell wall, and the pathway through which the signal is transmitted, is still in its infancy. Further studies on the responses of tobacco cells to B deprivation will certainly contribute to a better understanding of the cell wall&#x02013;symplast interaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>Suspension-cultured tobacco cells (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> L. cv.
