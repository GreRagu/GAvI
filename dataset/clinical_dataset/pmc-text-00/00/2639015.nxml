In soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic> L.), however, only a few ERF genes have been studied so far. In this study, 98 unigenes that contained a complete AP2/ERF domain were identified from 63&#x02009;676 unique sequences in the DFCI Soybean Gene Index database. The phylogeny, gene structures, and putative conserved motifs in soybean ERF proteins were analysed, and compared with those of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice. The members of the soybean ERF family were divided into 12 subgroups, similar to the case for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. AP2/ERF domains were conserved among soybean, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and rice. Outside the AP2/ERF domain, many soybean-specific conserved motifs were detected. Expression analysis showed that nine unigenes belonging to six ERF family subgroups were induced by both biotic/abiotic stresses and hormone treatment, suggesting that they were involved in cross-talk between biotic and abiotic stress-responsive signalling pathways. Overexpression of two full-length genes from two different subgroups enhanced the tolerances to drought, salt stresses, and/or pathogen infection of the tobacco plants. These results will be useful for elucidating ERF gene-associated stress response signalling pathways in soybean.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ERF family</kwd><kwd>gene function</kwd><kwd>phylogeny</kwd><kwd>soybean</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Drought, high salinity, low temperature, and pathogen attack are the most common stress factors that influence plant growth and development. To overcome these limitations, plants respond and adapt to stresses at the physiological and biochemical levels. AP2/ERF transcription factors, characterized by the presence of the AP2/ERF DNA-binding domain, play significant roles in regulating plant biotic and abiotic stress-responsive gene expression, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakuma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). AP2/ERF genes constitute a large superfamily, which has been divided into three groups named the AP2, ERF, and RAV families based on their sequence similarities and numbers of AP2/ERF domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). AP2 proteins contain two AP2/ERF domains, and genes in this family participate in the regulation of developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elliott <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chuck <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutilier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). RAV family proteins contain one AP2/ERF domain and a B3 domain, and have different biological functions compared with members in other families. Recently, members of the RAV family were shown to be involved in the ethylene response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alonso <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), the brassinosteroid response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and biotic and abiotic stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sohn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). ERF family proteins contain a single AP2/ERF domain, and are sometimes further divided into two major subfamilies, the CBF/DREB subfamily and the ERF subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakuma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Genes in the CBF/DREB subfamily play a crucial role in the response of plants to abiotic stresses by recognizing the dehydration-responsive element (DRE) with a core motif of A/GCCGAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thomashow, 1999</xref>). The ERF subfamily genes are mainly involved in response to biotic stresses such as pathogenesis by recognizing the <italic>cis</italic>-acting element AGCCGCC, known as the GCC box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hao <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>).</p><p>ERF and CBF/DREB subfamily transcription factors have been identified in various plant species, including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O&#x000f1;ate-S&#x000e1;nchez and Singh, 2002</xref>), rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and cotton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin and Liu, 2008</xref>). The roles of ERF and CBF/DREB proteins in the response to biotic and abiotic stress have also been extensively documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gutterson and Reuber, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The sequenced <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome contains 145 distinct genes encoding AP2/ERF-type proteins classified into five groups, that is APETALA2 (AP2) subfamily (17 genes), RAV subfamily (six genes), CBF/DREB subfamily (56 genes), ERF subfamily (65 genes), and one very specific gene, AL079349, based on similarities of their AP2/ERF DNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakuma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). The proteins of the CBF/DREB subfamily were further divided into six subgroups, A-1 to A-6, among which A-1 and A-2 were the two largest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakuma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Expression of the <italic>DREB1A/CBF3</italic> (A-1) genes is induced by low temperature stress, but not by drought or high salt stresses, whereas <italic>DREB2A</italic> (A-2) genes are induced by drought and high salt, but not by low temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>DREB1A/CBF3</italic> under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter increased tolerance to drought, high salt, and freezing stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kasuga <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilmour <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Overexpression of constitutively active <italic>DREB2A</italic> resulted in significant drought stress tolerance, but only slight freezing tolerance in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sakuma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Other DREB proteins such as TINY2 (A-4), GhDBP1 (A-5), GmDREB2 (A-5), and ZmDBF1 (A-6) were also characterized as stress-inducible proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kizis and Pages, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang and Liu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The proteins of the ERF subfamily were also divided into six groups termed B-1 to B-6. The expression and biological functions of genes in the ERF subfamily were summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakano <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref>. As an example, transcription of tobacco <italic>Tsi1</italic> (for <italic>Tobacco stress-induced gene1</italic>) was induced by salt, ethephon (ET), and salicylic acid (SA). Overexpression of <italic>Tsi1</italic> improved the tolerance to salt and pathogen attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakano <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> reported 147 and 157 genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice, respectively, which were classified as members of the AP2/ERF superfamily. Among the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ERF genes, 122 were considered as members of the CBF/DREB subfamily and the ERF subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakuma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In rice, there are 139 genes in the ERF family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The phylogeny, gene structures, and conserved motifs of ERF genes in these two species were also analysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Soybean is one of the most economically important crop species in the world. Only a few members of the ERF and CBF/DREB subfamily have been characterized in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazarei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and most of their functions remain to be determined. Recently, four CBF/DREB homologous genes (<italic>GmDREBa/b/c</italic> and <italic>GmDREB2</italic>), and one ERF homologous gene (<italic>GmEREBP1</italic>) were isolated from soybean and their expression characteristics were investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazarei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). To gain further information about the AP2/ERF superfamily in soybean, the DFCI Soybean Gene Index database was surveyed and 148 unigenes were identified in this superfamily, including 120 ERF family unigenes, 26 AP2 family unigenes, and two RAV family unigenes. Phylogenetic and protein motif structural analyses of the ERF and CBF/DREB subfamily were undertaken. The expression patterns of some genes belonging to the ERF subfamily were also characterized. The biological functions of the two full-length ERF genes were investigated in transgenic tobacco plants. The results from this study, reported herein, form a basis for future functional analyses of the soybean ERF family genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Data set and data treatment</title><p>The soybean unigene set and the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) used as a primary sequence data set are available on the TIGR Web site (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb&#x02009;= soybean) as the DFCI Soybean Gene Index, from which 63,676 unique sequences were download including 31&#x02009;928 TCs (tentative consensus sequences), 31&#x02009;636 singleton ESTs, and 112 singleton expressed transcript sequences.

Eighteen unigenes were predicted to encode a complete or incomplete AP2/ERF domain, whereas their AP2/ERF domains were distinct from those of members of the ERF family and more closely related to those of the AP2 family. Thus, these unigenes were also assigned to the AP2 family. TC218282 was predicted to encode one AP2/ERF domain and one B3 domain.

However, a comparative analysis of soybean and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> indicated that the phylogenetic analysis in soybean was reliable. Some of the unigenes have high sequence similarities with registered proteins in the NCBI web site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). For example, GmERF005, GmERF027, GmERF028, and GmERF076 encode proteins sharing 100% amino acid sequence identities with registered soybean proteins (GenBank accession nos AAT12423, AAP47161, ABB36646, and AAM45475, respectively). Therefore, the unigenes of the ERF family acquired in this study reflect the general status of ERF family members in soybean, and can be subjected to further analyses.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Soybean unigenes whose amino acid sequences have significant matches against the GenBank protein database</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Generic name</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Match description</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GenBank accession no.</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">E-value</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Length query (amino acids)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Identities</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GmERF005</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DREBa transcription factor</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAT12423</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.00E-99</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">215</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">100%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GmERF006</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DREB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAP83131</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.00E-78</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">241</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">98%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GmERF007</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DREB</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAP83131</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.00E-68</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">219</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">98%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GmERF023</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DREB protein</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAY89658</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.00E-66</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">172</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">94%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GmERF025</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAP47161</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.00E-77</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">178</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">90%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GmERF027</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ABB36646</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.00E-104</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">229</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">100%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GmERF028</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAP47161</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.00E-89</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">178</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">100%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GmERF029</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAZ03388</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.00E-130</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">316</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">99%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GmERF036</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DREB2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAQ57226</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.00E-146</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">313</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">99%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GmERF054</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ethylene-responsive protein</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAQ10777</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">383</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">97%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GmERF058</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ethylene-responsive protein</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAQ10777</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.00E-110</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">251</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">94%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GmERF076</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ethylene-responsive element-binding protein 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AAM45475</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.00E-97</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">203</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">100%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Comparative analysis of amino acid residues of the AP2/ERF domains in the soybean ERF family proteins with those of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice suggested the AP2/ERF domains were well conserved among the three species. These conserved amino acid residues probably indicate crucial roles for ERF family genes involved in different forms of physical contact with DNA. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen <italic>et al.</italic> (1998)</xref>, the AP2/ERF domain recognizes its target DNA via the conserved arginine and tryptophan residues in the &#x003b2;-sheet. Ala37 might play a crucial role in DNA binding or the stability of the AP2/ERF domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The conserved motif analysis of the ERF family demonstrated that most motifs were conserved in soybean, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and rice. Proteins within a subgroup that share these conserved motifs are likely to have similar functions. For example, the EAR motif is essential for gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Tobacco NtERF3, and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtERF3 and AtERF4, containing the conserved EAR motif, repress the expression of a GCC-box-containing reporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujimoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2001</xref>). Mutations within the EAR motif eliminated this capacity for repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). In addition to common conserved motifs in soybean, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and rice, there are soybean-specific ERF family motifs, which may have important roles in regulating biological processes in soybean; those functions need to be be demonstrated further. The comparative analysis of conserved motifs in soybean, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and rice suggested that protein functions have been both conserved and diverged during evolution of the ERF gene family.</p><sec><title>Expression patterns of ERF subfamily unigenes under stress treatments</title><p>Plants undergo a range of environmental stresses in their natural environments and have evolved a wide range of mechanisms to cope with them. There are multiple stress perception and signalling pathways, some of which are specific whereas others cross-talk at various steps. This signalling cross-talk occurs in biotic stress signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kunkel and Brooks, 2002</xref>), abiotic stress signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chinnusamy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Recent studies have revealed ERF subfamily transcription factors as promising candidates for proteins involved in cross-talk between stress signalling pathways. In this study, the expression of nine unigenes from different subgroups of the ERF subfamily following various stress treatments was analysed. Inoculation with SMV as a biotic stress increased the transcript levels of six unigenes in soybean plants. The abiotic stresses, drought, low temperature, and high salinity, induced the expression of nine, five, and nine unigenes, respectively. The expression of all nine unigenes was induced by treatments with SA, ET, JA, and ABA. ABA is a phytohormone that is extensively involved in responses to abiotic stresses such as drought and low temperature, as well as osmotic stress. ABA also governs a variety of growth and developmental processes, including seed development, dormancy, germination, and stomatal movement. In contrast, the phytohormones SA, JA, and ET play central roles in biotic stress signalling following pathogen infection. These signalling molecules primarily regulate the protective responses of plants against both biotic and abiotic stresses via synergistic and antagonistic actions, commonly described as signalling cross-talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mauch-Mani and Mauch, 2005</xref>). The present results suggest that there was significant cross-talk in the expression of the nine unigenes under abiotic and biotic stress conditions. As in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), it is speculated that cross-talk of signalling pathways in plants is a common phenomenon, allowing the formation of elaborate networks to regulate both abiotic stress tolerance and disease resistance. Hence the ERF subfamily of transcriptional factors may be connecting elements involved in cross-talk between stress signalling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of soybean ERF subfamily genes enhanced tolerance to biotic and/or abiotic stress</title><p>The ERF subfamily genes have been characterized in tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fischer and Droge-Laser 2004</xref>), <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broun <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), pepper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), corn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuck <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Overexpression of some ERF genes enhanced resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berrocal-Lobo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; Fischer and Dr&#x000f6;ge-Laser, 2004). So far, only one ERF subfamily gene (<italic>GmEREBP1</italic>) has been isolated and characterized from soybean. The transcript abundance decreased in soybean cyst-nematode-infected roots of a susceptible cultivar, whereas it increased in infected roots of a resistant cultivar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazarei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, ET treatment repressed <italic>GmEREBP1</italic> mRNA accumulation in both susceptible and resistant cultivars, whereas wounding increased expression in both cultivars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazarei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). <italic>GmEREBP</italic>1 transgenic soybean and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants inoculated with cyst nematodes did not display significantly altered responses to nematode infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mazarei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). According to the classification of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakuma <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)</xref>, <italic>GmEREBP1</italic> belongs to the B-3 subgroup of the ERF subfamily. In the present study, GmERF057 in subgroup B-2 and GmERF089 in subgroup B-5 were further characterized by overexpression in tobacco plants. Whereas the expression of GmERF057 was induced in soybean by salinity, drought, ET, SA, JA, ABA, and SMV treatments, but not by cold stress, its expression in transgenic tobacco plants conferred enhanced tolerance to salt and pathogen stress. The expression of GmERF089 was induced by salinity, drought, ET, SA, JA, and ABA treatments, but not by cold and SMV stresses, and GmERF089 transgenic plants had enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses, but not to pathogen stress. The results suggested that the ERF genes in different subgroups of the ERF subfamily have distinct functions dealing with specific environmental stress conditions using both different and common signal transduction pathways. The mechanism whereby ERF subfamily genes confer different stress tolerances when subjected to biotic and abiotic stresses needs further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern248/DC1"><bold>Table S1</bold></ext-link>.
