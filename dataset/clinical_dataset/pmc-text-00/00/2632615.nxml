In most cases, regional or distant expansion is already present at diagnosis. Distant metastases usually involve lungs and rarely, bones, mediastinum and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. On the contrary, hepatic metastases are extremely rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In this paper, we present the case of a patient who presented with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary and hepatic metastases.</p></sec><sec><title>Case presentation</title><p>We report the case of a 78-year old Greek man who presented with voice hoarseness, dyspnoea and a large mass on the anterior surface of the cervical region as well as constitutional symptoms such as anorexia, weight loss and malaise.

Routine biochemistry yielded normal results except increased C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase and &#x003b3;-glutaryl transferase. Other biochemical tests including tumor markers, thyroid hormones, antithyroid antibodies, hepatitis B (anti-HBV) and hepatitis C (anti-HCV) antibodies were negative. Chest X-ray showed enlargement of the superior mediastinum, deviation of the trachea to the left and bilateral pulmonary metastatic lesions. Computed tomography scan of the neck, thorax and abdomen revealed enlargement of the left thyroid lobe extending to the anterior mediastinum and compressing the trachea, metastatic bilateral pulmonary lesions and a large, nodular, contrast-enhanced mass-occupying lesion in the right hepatic lobe (figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Computed tomography scan of the cervical neck</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1757-1626-2-41-1"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Computed tomography scan of the thorax</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1757-1626-2-41-2"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Computed tomography scan of the liver</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1757-1626-2-41-3"/></fig><p>Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid was performed. The smear was very cellular with extremely pleomorphic cells in size-small to giant forms-and in shape-round, oval and spindle. These cells were isolated and in tissue fragments with large irregular nuclei, which showed clumped chromatin with parachromatin clearing and occasional large, multiple and irregular nucleoli (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The immunocytochemical staining revealed that the neoplasmatic cells were negative for calcitonin and neuron specific enolase and a few of them were slightly positive for thyroglobulin. Hence, the diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma was reached. Liver biopsy showed infiltrations with poorly differentiated anaplastic cells. These anaplastic cells were morphologically similar with the cells of the fine-needle aspiration specimen. Moreover, immunocytochemical staining revealed that a small number of these anaplastic cells were slightly positive for thyroglobulin (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Furthermore, immunocytochemistry yielded neoplasmatic cells positive for cytokeratin-7 and negative for cytokeratin-20, carcinoembryogenic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and hepatocyte paraffin-1 (HepPar-1). These findings were suggestive of hepatic metastasis from the primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Fine-needle aspiration biopsy smear of the thyroid (Papanicolaou stain)</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1757-1626-2-41-4"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Liver biopsy stained with thyroglobulin</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1757-1626-2-41-5"/></fig><p>During his hospitalization, the patient suffered progressive obstruction of the trachea due to rapid increase of the thyroid gland mass.

The patient was irradiated on cervical region and upper mediastinum with a daily dose of 300 cGy for 10 days which resulted in mild improvement of obstructive phenomena. However, the patient soon deteriorated with thrombocytopenia, elevated d-dimers, prolonged prothrombin time, anemia and transaminasaemia due to disseminated intravascular coagulation and he died within a few days.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This case shows that although rare, solitary large hepatic metastasis may constitute a complication in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Usually, the differential diagnosis of a metastatic hepatic lesion does not include the thyroid gland among the first organs to be investigated, since the thyroid gland usually metastasizes in lungs, bones and brain. From this aspect, the thorough physical examination of the thyroid is essential since in case of positive findings, the clinical suspicion of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma should be raised.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>anti-HBV: hepatitis B antibodies; anti-HCV: hepatitis C antibodies; CEA: carcinoembryogenic antigen; CA 19-9: carbohydrate antigen 19-9; HepPar-1: hepatocyte paraffin-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the wife of the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.
