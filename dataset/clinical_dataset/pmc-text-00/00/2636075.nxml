Treatment of this multifactorial entity istherefore varied. In this study, we performed different surgical procedures in patients of MED and evaluatedtheir outcome, based on ocular alignment, improvement in elevation and binocular functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design:</title><p>Retrospective interventional study.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Twenty-eight patients were included in this study, from June 2003 to August 2006.Five patients underwent Knapp procedure, with or without horizontal squint surgery, 17 patients had inferiorrectus recession, with or without horizontal squint surgery, three patients had combined inferior rectusrecession and Knapp procedure and three patients had inferior rectus recession combined with contralateralsuperior rectus or inferior oblique surgery. The choice of procedure was based on the results of forced ductiontest (FDT).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Forced duction test was positive in 23 cases (82%). Twenty-four of 28 patients (86%) werealigned to within 10 prism diopters. Elevation improved in 10 patients (36%) from no elevation above primary position(-4) to only slight limitation of elevation (-1). Five patients had preoperative binocular vision and none gainedit postoperatively. No significant postoperative complications or duction abnormalities were observed duringthe follow-up period.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Management of MED depends upon selection of the correct surgical technique based onemploying the results of FDT, for a satisfactory outcome.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Inferior rectus recession</kwd><kwd>Knapp surgery</kwd><kwd>monocular elevation deficiency</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Monocular elevation deficiency (MED) is characterized bydefective elevation, as well as adducted or abducted positionsin primary gaze, sometimes associated with hypotropia andptosis or pseudoptosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Though attributed to paralysis of boththe elevators in some cases, superior rectus palsy alone canaccount for MED.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> In addition, MED can be caused by inferiorrectus restriction and supranuclear etiologies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Differentiationon the basis of paretic or restrictive etiology, is important forappropriate surgical planning.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Extensive Medlinesearch did not reveal any major Indian study on MED.

Twenty-eight consecutivepatients, comprising 12 males and 16 females, formed the cohortin this study.</p><p>Patients with restrictive strabismus due to thyroid eyedisease, orbital fractures, orbital inflammation, orbital tumors,myasthenia gravis, ocular fibrosis and those with prior ocularand extraocular muscle surgery were excluded from thisstudy.</p><p>All patients underwent a detailed workup, including fullophthalmic and orthoptic evaluation prior to surgery. Thisincluded assessment of visual acuity using Snellen chart,Cambridge single and crowding cards, Sheriden-Gardnercharts and the &#x02033;hundreds and thousands&#x02033; test, as appropriatefor the age of the patient, full cycloplegic refraction in childrenand dynamic refraction in adults, anterior segment slit-lampbiomicroscopy and fundus examination. Deviation wasmeasured by alternate prism cover test for both near (33 cm)and distance (6 m) using fixation targets and with full opticalcorrection. Neutralizing prisms were placed on the eye withMED to measure the primary deviation, which formed thetarget angle for surgery. Fusion was assessed for near anddistance, using Worth four dot test, with room lights on, to makethe test, as much less dissociative as possible and stereopsiswas measured using TNO test, in both primary and chin upposition. Ocular movements were tested, including ductions,versions and vertical saccades. Ductions and versions werequantified on a four-point scale of -1 to -4, as follows: mildlimitation = -1, moderate limitation = -2, severe limitation = -3,no elevation above primary position = -4. True ptosis, whenpresent, was thoroughly evaluated. A forced duction test (FDT)was performed preoperatively for both elevation and depressionin cooperative patients and was done intraoperatively for non-cooperative patients. In suspected cases, myasthenia gravis wasruled out by the Tensilon test.</p><p>All surgeries were performed by any one of the two authors(PV, SS).</p><p>The postoperative ocular deviation was measured at theend of one month. The follow-up period ranged from sixmonths to three years. A satisfactory outcome was defined asan ocular deviation aligned to within 10 prism diopters (pd),in the primary position.</p><p>Based on the surgical procedure undertaken, the patientswere divided into six subgroups,</p><p>Group-1: Knapp procedure alone; was done in three patients,who had negative FDT for elevation. The surgical procedureconsisted of a 180&#x000b0; superior limbal peritomy, isolation ofthe medial rectus (MR) and lateral rectus (LR) muscles andtranspositioning them adjacent to the superior rectus (SR)muscle, preserving the contour of the spiral of Tillaux.</p><p>Group-2: Knapp procedure combined with horizontalmuscle (MR and LR) recession and resection for the associatedhorizontal strabismus in two patients.</p><p>Group-3: Recession of the inferior rectus (IR) alone; was donein 12 patients who had positive FDT for elevation, due to IRrestriction. The operative procedure was inferior conjunctivalperitomy, isolation of IR muscle, thorough separation of themuscle from the Lockwood&#x02032;s ligament and recession up to amaximum of 5 mm.</p><p>Group-4: Inferior rectus recession followed by Knappprocedure in two sittings with a gap of four months in threepatients.</p><p>Group-5: Inferior rectus recession, followed by horizontalmuscles&#x02032; recession and resection for coexisting horizontalsquint in two sittings with a gap of four months in fivepatients.</p><p>Group-6: Inferior rectus recession combined withcontralateral vertical rectus or oblique muscle surgery in threepatients wherein elevators were overacting.</p><p>In this study, grouping has been based on the surgicalprocedure performed. Monocular elevation deficiency canpresent as hypotropia alone or hypotropia associated withesotropia or exotropia. Hypotropia alone will require onlyKnapp surgery (Group-1) or IR surgery (Group-3), basedon FDT. However, associated horizontal strabismus, whenpresent, needs a different approach in which Knapp needs to becombined with recession and resection of MR and LR (Group-2)or IR recession needs to be combined with horizontal musclesurgery (Group-5). Sometimes when residual hypotropiapersists after IR surgery, a Knapp surgery is required in addition(Group-4). Lastly, associated overaction of contralateral verticalrectus or oblique muscles can have a bearing on the surgicalprocedure chosen (Group-6). In two cases, weakening of theoveracting contralateral SR was done in addition to IR recession.One of them habitually fixed with the MED eye, as the otherone was amblyopic and had hypertropia with SR overaction. Inanother case, recession of overacting inferior oblique (IO) wasdone with IR recession, with gratifying results. This is the basisof division into six groups, as each group is different from theother in their presentation and management.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at surgery in this study was 14.03 years with arange of two to 31 years.</p><p>The male patients were 12 (43%) and the female patientswere 16 (57%). Right eye (OD) was involved in 18 cases (64%)and left eye (OS) in 10 (35%) cases. The best-corrected visualacuity ranged from 20/30 to 3/200 in the affected eye [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>].</p><p>True ptosis was present in eight cases (29%) and MarcusGunn jaw winking phenomenon was present in two cases (7%).The preoperative ocular deviation varied from 20 to 40 pd ofhypotropia in primary position, with a mean deviation of 27.6 pd.Five patients (18%) had evidence of binocular single vision (BSV)at near with chin up position when tested with Worth four dot test.All others had suppression at near and distance. No patient hadany stereopsis on TNO test. Preoperative ductions measured -3or -4 in elevation, in all patients. The FDT was positive in 23 cases(82%); 27 patients preferred fixation with the non-paretic eye andone patient preferentially fixed with the paretic eye.</p><p>Elevation improved from -4 to -1 in 10 patients (36%), fivepatients had undergone Knapp procedure and five patientshad IR recession. In seven patients elevation improved to -2.The rest of the patients had significant elevation deficiencywhich was no better than -3. Postoperatively, no patient inany group gained BSV. Only those patients who had BSVpreoperatively, maintained it after surgery, with improvementin the chin up position. The BCVA also did not improve beyondthe preoperative level in any of the patient. Postoperatively 24of 28 patients (86%) had correction of deviation to within 10pd [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The treatment of MED is surgical. The etiopathogenesis of thiscondition is heterogeneous, which makes it difficult to treat itwith a single surgical formula. Successful alignment of MEDhas been described following different surgical modalities Theprocedure of choice is determined by the FDT, which ascertainswhether the cause is paretic due to SR palsy and/or IO palsy orrestrictive due to IR restriction.</p><p>In presence of SR palsy, the procedure employed is aKnapp transposition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> In his original work, Knappreported 15 patients, in whom correction of hypotropia ranged from21 to 55 pd with a mean of 38 pd.

Barsoum-Homsy performedKnapp surgery in four cases of MED and observed an averagecorrection of 31.7 pd.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Watson, in his series, observed a meancorrection of 30.5 pd.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Cooper and Greenspan, reportedan incidence of 26.6 pd of correction of hypotropia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> Scottperformed Knapp procedure in 19 patients and found acorrection of 21.1 pd in patients who had no prior surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>Caldeira, noted in his series of 10 patients, in whom Knappsurgery was performed, a mean correction of 36.4 pd fordistance and 29.5 pd for near.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> Kamlesh and Dadeya noted acorrection of 20 pd of horizontal and 25 pd of vertical correctionin their series of MED with associated horizontal deviation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Inthis series, five patients who underwent Knapp surgery, had amean correction of deviation of 29.4 pd, which correlates wellwith the results of most studies [Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>].</p><p>In our study, IR restriction was present in 23 out of 28 patients(82%). This high percentage has been reported by other authors.Wright has stated that the incidence of inferior restriction inMED is 70%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Scott and Jackson reported IR restriction in 11out of 15 patients (73.3%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> Metz reported 12 out of 15 patientsof MED having restriction in elevation on FDT (80%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> Someauthors have advised, in such cases, IR recession ranging from5 to 8 mm, while others have reported increased complicationswith recessions exceeding 5 mm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> We have restricted IRrecession to a maximum of 5 mm, to lower the complicationsof hypertropia in downgaze and lower lid retraction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> Theaverage correction was 16 pd from an average preoperativedeviation of 25.8 pd.</p><p>Inferior rectus recession needs to be followed by Knappprocedure in the presence of residual SR palsy, due to persistenthypotropia. In our series, three such patients underwent bothsurgeries, with an average correction of 28.6 pd of deviation,at the end of two surgeries [Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>]. Kocak-Altimtas<italic>et al</italic>., reported a series of six MED patients with positive FDT,who underwent IR recession, followed by Knapp, achieving amean correction of 25.8 &#x000b1; 5.6 pd.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> Scott reports a higher averagecorrection of 38 pd following two surgeries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p><p>Anterior segment ischemia (ASI) has been reported to occurafter such procedures, due to disruption of ciliary circulation.One of our patients, a healthy young man aged 26 years, whounderwent Knapp with IR recession surgery, was noted to havecells and flare in the anterior chamber, 24 h after the secondsurgery. The two surgeries were spaced by a gap of four monthsand there was no evidence of any cardiovascular disease toaccount for this. The ASI, in this patient, was well controlled withtopical steroids and cycloplegics. His recovery within a span oftwo weeks could be attributed to the young age of the patient.</p><p>In two cases, where contralateral SR recession was doneand in one patient where contralateral IO recession was done,good alignment results within 10 pd of orthotropia of primaryposition were achieved. Similar reports were achieved by Xiao,Shun and Li in their series of 11 patients, where they performedSR recession in the non-paretic eye in two cases, six monthsafter IR recession with satisfactory results.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></p><p>Improvement in elevation occurring after Knapptransposition, is attributed to alteration in the point of tangencyof the muscle with the globe, thereby changing the point ofmechanical action. In addition, transposition results in a newmuscle plane with a new axis of rotation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> Improvement ofelevation following IR recession occurs due to weakening ofthe restricted muscle, in the presence of normal SR function.Failure of improvement in elevation after IR recession is likelyto be due to residual paresis of SR muscle.</p><p>Incidence of binocular vision was 18% in this study. Thelow incidence could be attributed to the congenital onset ofMED that leads to early development of suppression andamblyopia. A large angle of hypotropia, often compoundedwith ptosis, was an important factor for disruption ofbinocularity. A smaller hypotropia may be overcome by achin up position to achieve binocularity. Since most patientshad large hypotropias of congenital onset, the incidence ofbinocularity was low.</p><p>In conclusion, we feel MED, though etiologicallymultifactorial, can be satisfactorily managed by judiciousselection of the surgical technique.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Source of Support: This research work is supported by a grantthrough ORBIS International</p></fn><fn><p>Conflict of Interest: None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rosenbaum</surname><given-names>AL</given-names></name><name><surname>Santiago</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical strabismus management</article-title><source>Principles and Surgical Techniques</source><year>1999</year><publisher-name>W.B.
