Introduction</title><p>Efficient and safe vectors are a critical element for DNA delivery in gene therapy. Viral vectors have been used as delivery vectors in most gene therapy methods because of their very efficient gene delivery, but they suffer from problems such as safety concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-2278">1</xref>], limited loading capacity and limited scale of production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-2278">2</xref>]. Non-viral vectors have some advantages over viral approaches. A good non-viral gene delivery vector should display low cytotoxicity and high efficiency of DNA delivery into cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-2278">2</xref>]. Polyethylenimine (PEI) is a cationic polymer in wide usage in research as a non-viral gene delivery vector. Its transfection efficiency and toxicity depend on its molecular weight &#x02013; high molecular weight PEI showed high transfection efficiency, and low molecular weight PEI (less than 2000 Da) showed low transfection efficiency and low toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-9-2278">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-9-2278">5</xref>]. Petersen <italic>et al</italic>. significantly enhanced the plasmid DNA condensation of low molecular weight (LMW) PEI by cross-linking it with star-shaped polyethylene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-9-2278">6</xref>]. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligomers of glucose, which are biocompatible and have low toxicities in animals and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-9-2278">7</xref>]. CDs had been incorporated into cationic polymers which have been employed for gene delivery since 1999 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijms-9-2278">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-9-2278">11</xref>]. Cationic polymers modified with CDs showed lower cytotoxicity and higher gene transfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-2278">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-2278">14</xref>]. Tang <italic>et al</italic>. synthesized cationic polymers by using &#x003b2;-CD to cross-link PEI (Mw 600), which displayed high transfection efficiency compared to PEI 25 kDa and effectively mediated gene transfection in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-9-2278">15</xref>]. Yang <italic>et al</italic>. synthesized a novel cationic star-shaped polymer as a non-viral gene delivery vector by conjugating PEI to &#x003b1;-CD. The star-shaped polymer showed excellent transfection efficiency <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-9-2278">16</xref>]. In our previous study, hydroxypropyl-&#x003b2;-CD (HP &#x003b2;-CD) and hydroxypropyl-&#x003b3;-CD (HP &#x003b3;-CD) were linked to LMW PEI as gene delivery vectors. The co-polymers had low cytotoxicity and high gene transfection efficiency properties in SKOV-3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-9-2278">17</xref>]. In this study, a novel non-viral vector based on 2-hydroxypropyl-&#x003b1;-cyclodextrin (HP &#x003b1;-CD) conjugated to LMW PEI is presented. The structure was confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR. Its cytotoxicity and gene transfection efficiency were measured in SK-BR-3 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results|discussion"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><p>The co-polymer was synthesized as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijms-9-2278">Scheme 1</xref>.

The signal at &#x003b4; 1.038 p.p.m. was assigned to the -CH<sub>3</sub> protons of the HP &#x003b1;-CD hydroxypropyl group, and the signals at &#x003b4; 2.4&#x02013;3.0 p.p.m. were assigned to the -NHCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>- protons from the PEI 600 Da. From the 1H-NMR integration values it could be estimated that the ratio of CD and PEI was 1:10.7.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2. Particle size and zeta potential test</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-2278">Figure 2</xref> shows the particle size and zeta potential of HP &#x003b1;-CD-PEI/DNA and PEI 600/DNA complexes. When N/P ratio was at 50 (N/P ratio, the number of nitrogen residues for PEI per the number of phosphate for DNA), the particle size of HP &#x003b1;-CD-PEI/DNA/DNA complexes was close to 186 nm, and that of the PEI/DNA complexes was about 4,800 nm. The zeta potential of HP &#x003b1;-CD-PEI/DNA complexes was about +16.0 mV, and PEI 600/DNA was about -17 mV. The positively charged polymer could condense efficiently with negatively charged DNA, but it would aggregate <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. In our experiment, the zeta potential of HP &#x003b1;-CD-PEI/DNA complexes was about +16.0 Mv, lower than PEI 25 kDa, which would avoid aggregation (the zeta potential of PEI 25 kDa was about +27.4 mV when N/P Ratio was at 10; data shown in the Supplementary Material). We thought that after the CD conjugated with PEI 600 to form the co-polymer, it could efficiently compact DNA into nano-particles. The improvement of condensing DNA with LMW PEI might be attributed to the formation high molecular weight co-polymer.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3.

Cell viability assay</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-2278">Figure 4</xref> shows the cell viability assay results for different co-polymer/DNA complexes in SK-BR-3 cells. For HP-&#x003b1;-CD-PEI, when the concentration was up to 1,250 nmol/mL, the cell viability was about 94.7 &#x000b1; 2.4%. For PEI 25 kDa, cell viability was only 18.6 &#x000b1; 0.7% when the concentration was 300 nmol/mL. For HP &#x003b3;-CD-PEI group, cell viability was about 15.3 &#x000b1; 1.9% when the concentration was 1,500 nmol/mL. For HP &#x003b2;-CD-PEI group and PEI 600, they maintained low toxicity at all concentrations. The results indicated that HP &#x003b1;-CD-PEI and HP &#x003b3;-CD-PEI have low cytotoxicity and HP &#x003b2;-CD-PEI has no cytotoxicity in SK-BR-3 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>2.5.

For HP &#x003b1;-CD-PEI/DNA complexes the optimal N/P ratio was at 50: 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-2278">Figure 5</xref> A). For HP &#x003b2;-CD-PEI/DNA and HP &#x003b3;-CD-PEI/DNA complexes the optimal N/P ratios were at 300:1 and 40:1 (data shown in the Supplementary Material). The Relative Light Unit data (RLU/mg protein) for HP &#x003b1;-CD-PEI was 5.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>, which was close to that of PEI 25 kDa (5.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>).

Figures 7c1 to Figure 7c4 were the HP &#x003b1;-CD-PEI/DNA group. From the images we could infer that the positive cells which expressed GFP (green fluorescence protein) in PEI 25 kDa and HP &#x003b1;-CD-PEI had no significant difference at low concentrations of FBS (10% and 20% ). Increasing the concentration of FBS, the expressed GFP were decreased in two polymers.

Zhao <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-9-2278">20</xref>] used CDs to increase the cellular uptake of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides.

In our study, a novel co-polymer based on LMW PEI linked to HP &#x003b1;-CD was synthesized, and it showed low cytotoxicity and high transfection efficiency. Especially in high concentration of FBS, the co-polymer showed higher transfection efficiency than that of PEI 25 kDa in SK-BR-3 cells. A plausible explanation was that the zeta potential of co-polymer/DNA complexes was lower than that of PEI 25 kDa and as a result, it could bind more cell membranes than protein in serum. Another explanation was that cyclodextrins can improve the cellular delivery of oligonucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-9-2278">7</xref>].
