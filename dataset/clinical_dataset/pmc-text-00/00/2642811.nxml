In the early days, it was postulated that this technique would eventually replace hybridoma technology and animal immunisations. However, since this technology emerged more than 20 years ago, there have only been a handful reports on the construction and application of phage display antibody libraries world-wide.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we report the simplest and highly efficient method for the construction of a highly useful human single chain variable fragment (scFv) library. The least number of oligonucleotide primers, electroporations and ligation reactions were used to generate a library of 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>individual clones, without generation of sub-libraries. All possible combinations of heavy and light chains, among all immunoglobulin isotypes, were included by using a mixture of primers and overlapping extension PCR. The key difference from other similar libraries was the highest diversity of variable gene repertoires, which was derived from 140 non-immunized human donors. A wide variety of antigens were successfully used to affinity select specific binders. These included pure recombinant proteins, a hapten and complex antigens such as viral coat proteins, crude snake venom and cancer cell surface antigens. In particular, we were able to use standard bio-panning method to isolate antibody that can bind to soluble Aflatoxin B1, when using BSA-conjugated toxin as a target, as demonstrated by inhibition ELISA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results suggested that by using an optimized protocol and very high repertoire diversity, a compact and efficient phage antibody library can be generated. This advanced method could be adopted by any molecular biology laboratory to generate both na&#x000ef;ve or immunized libraries for particular targets as well as for high-throughput applications.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Monoclonal antibodies have become important tools in several fields, including molecular biology, pharmaceutical and medical research, as well as in the treatment of diseases such as cancer and infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Since the advent of antibody technology, antibody production has moved from hybridoma technology to recombinant DNA methodology. The advantages of recombinant antibodies are several folds, (i) antibodies can be produced in bacteria, yeast or plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], (ii) immunization is not required and (iii) intrinsic properties such as immunogenicity, affinity, specificity and stability of antibodies can be improved by various mutagenesis technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the past two decade, advances in phage display and antibody engineering have led to the development of phage-displayed antibody technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This technology allows one to isolate antibodies directly from diverse repertoires of antibody genes, generating high-affinity binding sites without the constraint imposed by classical method for generating either polyclonal or monoclonal antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Since the method does not depend on an animal's immune system, antibodies to a wide variety of antigens, including the molecules that cannot stimulate immune system of the animals such as nonimmunogenic, "self", cell surface or toxic antigens, can be generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The antibodies can also be engineered to contain in-built features that suit various downstream applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] or converted into functional whole immunoglobulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The antibody genes are expressed and the gene products displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage as fusion proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This collection of phages is called a phage display antibody library, where each phage particle displays a single antibody. In order to construct a library, antibody genes are fused to phage genes, thus creating a link between antibody phenotype and its encoded genotype. Antibody genes can be isolated from B-lymphocytes of non-immunized donors, rendering a na&#x000ef;ve library which is a valuable source of human monoclonal antibodies against various antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Various formats of antigen-binding fragments, including Fab and scFv have been cloned and displayed on phage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The advantage of smaller antibody fragments is that they have high tissue penetrability, while maintaining their affinity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. They are also easier and faster to produce in recombinant form. However, successful construction of a human antibody phage library has been achieved only by a small number of research groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. One reason may be because of the complexity and cost of generation of the library, even though there have been some reports describing optimized protocols for the generation of efficient libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Here we report a simple and highly efficient method for the construction of a compact and highly useful scFv human library. The library was based on the na&#x000ef;ve human re-arranged V-genes and assembled through the use of a gene repertoire derived from 140 non-immunized donors. All possible combinations of heavy and light chains, among all immunoglobulin isotypes, were included by using a mixture of primers and overlapping extension PCR. The resulting variable gene repertoire were cloned to form a moderate size library composed of 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>individual clones from one ligation reaction. This repertoire was used for selection of specific binders to different proteins, a hapten, and complex antigens i.e., viral coat proteins, crude snake venom and cancer cell surface. Binding specificity and sequence diversity among binders were demonstrated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Construction of pMod1 phagemid</title><p>A novel phagemid vector, designated pMod1, for the construction of phage-displayed scFv library was created (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This vector was based on the phagemid vector, pHage 3.2 (Maxim Biotech Inc, USA). A multiple cloning site was introduced, containing five restriction recognition sties, of which <italic>Sfi</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I were used for the insertion of scFv gene repertoires. The gene III leader peptide was used to direct the secretion of scFv, whereas ampicillin resistant gene was used for the selection and maintenance of the phagemid. The scFv gene was linked to the hexahistidine tag followed by Myc epitope. The hexahistidine tag can be used for one-step affinity purification with immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), whereas the Myc epitope can be recognized by 9E10 monoclonal antibody for detection. An amber stop codon was introduced between the Myc-tag and gene III, thus allowing production of non-fused scFv by introduction of the phagemid DNA in a non-suppressor <italic>E. coli </italic>strains (HB2151).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Map of phagemid vector, pMod1, for the construction of scFv phage-display library</bold>. This 4541-base-pair (bp) vector was modified from pHage 3.2 (Maxim Biotech, Inc.), which was derived from M13. Transcription is under control of the <italic>lac </italic>promoter. The ampicillin resistant gene is for the selection and maintenance of the phagemid. The phagemid carries Fi and ColEi origin of replication for amplification in phage and <italic>E. coli</italic>. The secretion of the scFv fragment is directed by gene III signal peptide. The scFv genes are cloned between <italic>Sfi</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I for display on the phage coat protein, pIII. An amber stop codon in frame with and immediately following hexahistidine-tag and Myc-tag permit the expression of scFv as a fusion with gene III in an amber suppressor host (TG1) or as a fusion with only the 6 &#x000d7; His-tag and Myc-tag in a non-suppressor host strain (HB2151). The scFv fragment is fused with hexahistidine tag and Myc tag for affinity purification and immuno-detection, respectively. The coding region of a gene III leader peptide and the multiple cloning sites is shown with the position of 6 &#x000d7; His, Myc tags and amber stop codon. The map was not drawn to scale. The sequences around the cloning sites were shown at the bottom of the figure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6750-9-6-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Library construction</title><p>A diagram that outlines the construction of the compact scFv antibody library is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Peripheral blood from one hundred and forty healthy non-immunized donors was collected into four pools, according to different blood groups. These include adults at the age between 17&#x02013;50, both male and female, in Nakhon Ratchasima province. The bloods were tested and discharged from the Thai Red Cross Society blood donation unit. Total RNA was prepared from the B lymphocytes and pooled together before being used as templates for the construction of V-genes repertoire. A mix of oligo-dT<sub>18 </sub>and random hexamers were used to synthesize cDNA, so that all five antibody isotypes could potentially be represented. In order to reduce amplification bias, we performed 75 independent PCR reactions to amplify V gene segments, using all possible combinations within a primer set (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The primer sequences, which in theory encompass the entire repertoire of human antibody genes, were obtained from V BASE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and modified according to previously published protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The PCR reactions included six V<sub>H </sub>forward primers (V<sub>H</sub>5'SfiI) paired with four V<sub>H </sub>reverse primers (V<sub>H</sub>3'link) which generated a total of twenty-four reactions; whereas six V<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>forward primers (V<sub>L</sub>5'link-&#x003ba;) paired with five V<sub>&#x003ba; </sub>reverse primers (V<sub>L</sub>3'NotI-&#x003ba;) generated a total of thirty reactions; and seven V<sub>&#x003bb; </sub>forward primers (V<sub>L</sub>5'link-&#x003bb;) paired with three V<sub>&#x003bb; </sub>reverse primers (V<sub>L</sub>3'NotI-&#x003bb;) generated a total of twenty-one reactions.

Thirteen different patterns were identified as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. DNA sequence analysis of ten different clones revealed that the scFv fragments were all in-frame [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. The fingerprints of clone3 and clone8 were apparently identical; although their nucleotide and amino acid sequences were different. The variable regions were derived from thirteen different V gene families, including all six V<sub>H </sub>gene families (V<sub>H</sub>1, V<sub>H</sub>2, V<sub>H</sub>3, V<sub>H</sub>4, V<sub>H</sub>5, and V<sub>H</sub>6) and seven V<sub>L </sub>gene families of both kappa and lambda light chain (V<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>2, V<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>3, V<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>4 and V<sub>&#x003bb;</sub>2, V<sub>&#x003bb;</sub>3, V<sub>&#x003bb;</sub>5, V<sub>&#x003bb;</sub>6).

Thus, the scFv gene fragments were distributed across the full repertoire of antibody germ line genes. The number of different amino acids from germ line varied from 0&#x02013;24 amino acids, suggesting that both germ line B genes and antibodies from secondary immune responses were included in the library [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>].

These antigens include pure proteins [BSA, GST, Amylase], hapten [BSA-conjugated Aflatoxin B1], and very complex antigens [snake venom (cobra and green viper), rabies viruses, and cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) cells]. To reduce the amount of antigens needed for each bio-panning, all antigens were immobilized on wells of 96-well ELSIA plate (except for cancer cells that were grown on 5-ml flask). The numbers of clones obtained from the first rounds of selection were varied, as shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. After the first round of selection with a particular antigen, up to 96 phage clones were picked and their binding specificity determined by phage ELISA. We were able to obtain at least one specific phage clone for all antigens, except for crude green pit viper snake venom. An additional round of panning increased the ratio of binders but did not increase the chance to obtain clones not already detected after the round one. As demonstrated in the case of snake venom, the nine clones that were isolated from the second round of panning were all the same and identical to the clone obtained from the first round of selection. For attenuated virus, six out of seven clones from the second round of panning were identical. The number of clones obtained from the first round of panning varied, depending on the type of the antigens and the number of washings.

There are several examples of successful isolation of antibodies against various antigens from different phage displayed antibody libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], including high throughput selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Unfortunately, the libraries are not available commercially; any laboratories that are interested in using this technique are required to construct a library by themselves, or obtained existing libraries for research with restrictions. Of the two types of phage antibody libraries (immunized and non-immunized libraries), the nonimmune library is of more general use, because it can be applied to generate antibodies to any desired antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These "naive" libraries normally has been constructed from the light-chain and heavy-chain IgM-V-gene pools of B cells isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes, bone marrow, or spleen cells of nonimmunized healthy donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. However, it has been reported that the diversity of the library could also be maximized by using random hexamers to prime cDNA synthesis, so that all five antibody classes could potentially be represented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Since the whole antibodies cannot be functionally expressed in bacteria, only the antibody fragments that contain the binding regions are displayed on the surface of the bacteriophage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Most of the phage libraries that have been constructed display the antibody fragment on the surface of the phage minor coat proteins (pIII). It has been shown that both Fab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and scFv [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] can be expressed in the surface of M13 without apparent loss of the antibody's specificity and affinity. Since the scFv format has been shown to be more efficient for display on phage coat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and the aim of this research was to develop the most efficient method to construct a compact human antibody, the scFv format was chosen.</p><p>Several strategies have been described for producing antibody phage display library in scFv format but it is difficult to define the minimal repertoire size needed to retrieve good binders to antigens. Many approaches have been proposed to improve phage displayed human antibody repertoires, mainly by increasing the library sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], by sophisticated <italic>in vivo </italic>(Cre-<italic>lox</italic>) recombination method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and by improving cloning steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In this study, we describe a simple and highly efficient method to construct a compact human scFv phage library, by modification of several previously published protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Our method needs the least number of oligonucleotide primers (33 primers). The lab of J.D. Marks used 66 primers to construct a naive library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] while the lab of J. McCafferty used 89 primers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In these reports, two sets of primers were used to construct the library. The first set allow the amplification of the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>gene repertoires from cDNA, and the second set is used to introduce restriction sites for sub-cloning the genes into phagemid. In our work, we optimized the protocol such that only one set of primers are used to both amplify the genes and introduction of restriction sites, thus reducing the number of primers by half. Moreover, in all of the previous reports on the construction of large (10<sup>9&#x02013;10</sup>) na&#x000ef;ve human libraries, smaller libraries were first created and then combined together to obtain the larger libraries. For example, Vaughan's library of 1.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10 </sup>was generated from three sub-libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], Sheet's library of 6.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9 </sup>was generated from two sub-libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and McCafferty's library of 10<sup>10 </sup>was generated from sixteen sub-libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In our work, because of the compact size, we used only a couple of ligation reactions and electroporations, compare to thirty six [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] to several hundred electroporations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and more than twelve ligation reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] used by others to construct the libraries. Thus, one can use our method to create a compact phage display antibody library that is better than other libraries of the same size, and equally well to larger libraries, with less time and budget.</p><p>The scFv phage library was created by focusing on amplification of highly diverse re-arranged V genes, as it has been formerly suggested that the most useful scFv library are constructed from V-genes rearranged <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In order to reduce amplification bias we performed 75 independent PCR reactions using all possible combinations within a primer set, modified from previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The high diversity of this compact library came from the high diversity of re-arranged variable region genes, which were isolated from one hundred and forty non-immunized healthy donors. This is the highest number of re-arranged V-gene templates that has ever been reported. Other reports of large and complex human scFv libraries, for example, used five [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], forty two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], forty three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], or fifty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] donors.</p><p>The cDNAs from peripheral blood lymphocytes of the 140 non-immunized donors were synthesized using a mix of random hexamers and oligo dTs, so that all five antibody classes could be represented. Amplification using these non-specific primers has been shown to be as efficient as using germline, V<sub>H</sub>, IgG or IgM, specific primers for the construction of efficient na&#x000ef;ve repertoires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In order to create scFv fragment genes as a V<sub>H</sub>-linker-V<sub>L </sub>type, the 3' ends of V<sub>H </sub>genes were made complementary to 5' ends of V<sub>L </sub>genes through a (Gly<sub>4</sub>Ser)<sub>3 </sub>linker peptide, and the V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>genes were assembled and amplified by overlap extension followed by pull-through PCR. Moreover, to ensure the correct overlaps during assembly PCR, the three (Gly<sub>4</sub>Ser)<sub>3 </sub>repeat in the single chain linker region were encoded by different codons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A proof reading DNA polymerase was used in the overlap extension step to ensure the accurate joining of blunt ends of V<sub>H </sub>and V<sub>L </sub>genes segments and in-frame formation of scFv repertoire. For other steps, TAQ DNA polymerase was used due to a more efficient amplification using this polymerase. In addition, the mutations created by amplification errors could add more diversity to the library. The primer sets used for the amplification of V gene repertoires were designed based on information retrieved from V-BASE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The 5' and 3' ends of each primer incorporated sequences which could be cleaved by restrictions enzymes, avoiding a two step amplification procedure as previously reported for a murine scFv library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It has been previously suggested that several hundred bps of DNA sequence 5' and 3' of the scFv cloning sites is required for efficient digestion of the insert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]; however we found that this is not necessary, provided that the inserts were incubated with the restriction enzyme for at least 10 hour. In addition to the shortest list of primer used, the fewest steps were needed for the generation of the library. This is because only one ligation step and two electroporation were required, without the creation of sub-libraries as performed by other strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Utilization of different modified helper phages to improve the bio-panning efficiency has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Here, the helper phage KM13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], which is a protease sensitive helper phage, was used during the bio-panning. This modified helper phage encodes a modified gene III, encoding a peptide sequence which will be cleaved by trypsin, between domain D2 and D3. By applying trypsin cleavage following selection of the phage antibody library, the phage particles not carrying an antibody-pIII fusion would lose all there domain D1 and D2 of protein 3, and thus lose their ability to infect bacteria; whereas phage particles carrying an antibody-pIII fusion would retain their infectivity, due to the absence of the protease sensitive site in the gene III of the fusion. Thus, in the bio-panning procedure described here, elution was done by a combination of low pH treatment with glycine buffer (pH2.2) and trypsin treatment. Any phagemid encoded phage display library contain a large proportion of phage particles devoid of pIII fusion on their surface, however these can still be retrieved following selection due to non-specific binding of phage particles. Removal of phage particles carrying no scFv by trypsin digestion, greatly improve the efficiency of the selection. We found that we obtained better result when using KM13 helper phage than regular helper phage, M13K07 (data not shown). Utilization of KM13 helper phage also limits the number of eluted phages after the first round of section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], which would be a logic consequence of decreasing the number of background binders of non-displaying phage particles and taken together this explain why only one round of panning is sufficient for most selections done in this study.</p><p>Our compact scFv antibody phage library of 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>scFv repertoire rendered binders to seven different antigens. The number of different antibody fragments selected with each antigen was in the same range as from other na&#x000ef;ve scFv phage display library, even though those libraries are 93 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and 44 times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] larger than ours. Since we aimed to amplify as many different variable regions as possible, sequence diversity was confirmed in both the primary library and the binders retrieved after antigen selection. The high diversity of our compact scFv library was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of ten randomly picked clones from unselected library and seven selected clones. Sequence analysis of the primary library indicated that variable regions were derived from all six V<sub>H </sub>and seven V<sub>L </sub>gene families. The variable regions derived from V<sub>H</sub>1, V<sub>H</sub>3, V<sub>H</sub>4, V<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>1, V<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>3, V<sub>&#x003bb;</sub>1, V<sub>&#x003bb;</sub>6 families had been commonly observed among antibody fragments from phage display libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], and human hybridomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Besides variable regions derived from these preferences gene families, other less frequently used V gene families i.e., V<sub>H</sub>2, V<sub>H</sub>5, V<sub>H</sub>6, V<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>2, V<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>4, V<sub>&#x003bb;</sub>2, V<sub>&#x003bb;</sub>3 and V<sub>&#x003bb;</sub>5 were also found in our library. These clones were derived from a number of germ line segments with varied number of amino acid substitutions, ranging from 0&#x02013;24, indicating excellent diversity in our scFv phage library. We observed a preference usage of certain V gene segments in unselected library (V<sub>H</sub>3DP47, V<sub>&#x003bb;</sub>DPL16, and V<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>3DPK22) as well as in the selected clones (V<sub>H</sub>3DP47, and V<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>1DPK9). This is in accordance with the bias of gene segments most often found in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] The length (5&#x02013;19) and amino acid sequence of CDR3 regions varied considerably, even when the genes came from the same germ line segments. None of these clones shared the same CDR3 sequence. These are all characteristic of the creation of naturally occurring immunoglobulin repertoire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], which involve somatic recombination during the development of B cells in the central lymphoid organs, and somatic hypermutation that operates on B cell in peripheral lymphoid organs, resulting in an affinity maturation of the antibody population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Thus, a highly diverse and compact antibody library similar to nature could be successfully constructed from a large number of V gene repertoire templates. It has been estimated that the human antibody repertoire is at least 10<sup>11 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]; however, the number of antibody specificities present at any one time is limited by the total number of B cells in an individual, as well as by each individual's encounters with antigens, which is approximately 10<sup>8 </sup>different specificities at any one time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. This is the same diversity of the compact library described in this paper. Therefore, by performing one-round of bio-panning with this library, one can mimic natural selection and obtain a diverse pattern of binding antibodies.</p><p>Even if the size of the library is essential for successful isolation of high affinity antibodies, a very large library is difficult to maintain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and in many case, high affinity is not necessary the pre-requisite for successful application of antibody. This is because other properties such as specificity, expression level and stability are also important. The affinity of the antibody can be further enhanced by affinity maturation as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. These methods involve introduction of diversity into the antibody genes by various methods of mutagenesis such as error-prone PCR, DNA or chain shuffling, or oligonucleotide-directed PCR, while affinity selection of the variants with decreasing amounts of antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The affinity maturation process is useful either for improving the affinity of antibody that is selected from naive phage library of medium size (10<sup>7&#x02013;8 </sup>different clones) that has lower binding affinity, or for generating "super" antibody to be used in certain applications, such as diagnostic or immunotherapy. It has been reported that phage antibodies with approximately tenfold higher affinities (10<sup>11 </sup>M<sup>-1</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] than the ceiling affinity that can be obtained from <italic>in vivo </italic>selection of B-cell (10<sup>10 </sup>M<sup>-1</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] have been made by in vitro affinity maturation.</p><p>The ability to isolate an antibody that can recognize free Aflatoxin from a simple bio-panning procedure underscores the high quality of our compact library. It has been well known that it is difficult to obtain antibody against free haptens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], especially from the na&#x000ef;ve library. Recombinant scFv against soluble alfatoxin that has been generated so far could only be obtained from either an optimized bio-panning method by elution with soluble haptens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], or isolated from hybridoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The ability to isolate antibodies that are specific to both conjugated and free Aflatoxin demonstrated the high quality of this compact library. It is possible that the population of donors have been previously exposed to Aflatoxin as it is a very common contaminant in the region.</p><p>In addition to hapten, we also demonstrated successful selections of specific antibodies against complex antigens, i.e., crude snake venom, cancer cell surface, and rabies virus, which are more difficult to obtain. This is because of the limited amount of target antigen present in the mixture, the background binding, and enrichment of phage antibodies specific for non-relevance antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, one cannot rule out the possibility that the apparent specific binding of antibody to complex target is actually resulted from the different level of expression of the recognized antigen. Thus, characterization of these selected antibodies, as well as more investigation to determine the identities of their specific partners, are needed to be done.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, a simple method for the construction of a compact and efficient human scFv phage library has been reported. The key to the success of this method is a very high diversity V-gene repertoire template that was obtained from 140 non-immunized donors in combination with optimized primer set and cloning technique. This method is very practical and should be able to be carried out in any academic institutions, small research facilities, and non-profit organizations world-wide, for the generation of both na&#x000ef;ve and immunized human phage display scFv library.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antigens</title><p>Albumin from bovine serum (BSA) was natural purified protein obtained from Fluka, USA.

These blood samples were tested negative and discharged from the Thai Red Cross Society blood donation unit in Nakhon Ratchasima province. Total RNA was prepared from the B lymphocytes and pooled together. Approximately 2 ml of blood samples from each donor were collected into four pools, according to different blood groups (blood group A, B, O and AB). Thus, a total of approximately 280 ml of blood sample was used. B-lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood by using Ficoll plaque reagent (Amersham, USA). Briefly, the diluted blood sample (1:1 of blood per PBS) was carefully layered on top of the Ficoll plaque reagent, and then the two-phase solution was centrifuged at 400 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 30 minutes. B-lymphocytes were collected from the interface between the two phases. The interface contamination such as platelets and plasma proteins were removed by washing with PBS. Total RNA was extracted from B-lymphocytes by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). B-lymphocytes were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol and incubated at 65&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes with occasional inversion of the tube. After adding 0.2 ml of chloroform, the tube was vortexed for 15 seconds and then centrifuged at 12,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube containing 1 &#x003bc;l of RnaseOut (40 U/&#x003bc;l, Invitrogen, USA), and 0.5 ml of isopropanol was added to precipitate RNA. The tube was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The precipitated RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. The pellet was washed with 0.5 ml of 75% ethanol and then centrifuged at 12,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 15 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. After the supernatant was removed, the pellet was air dried for 5 minutes at room temperature and dissolved in sterile deionized water. Then 1 &#x003bc;l of RnaseOut (40 U/&#x003bc;l, Invitrogen, USA) was added into total RNA and stored at -70&#x000b0;C. First strand cDNA was generated from 10 &#x003bc;g of total RNA, using MMuLV reverse transcriptase (NEB, USA) with a mix of 20 &#x003bc;M of oligo-dT<sub>18 </sub>and 8 ng of random hexamer primer. The genes for variable regions of heavy chain, &#x003ba; light chain, and &#x003bb; light chain (V<sub>H</sub>, V<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>, and V<sub>&#x003bb;</sub>) were amplified separately and recombined by three subsequent PCR reactions. The first set of PCR consists of 75 independent reactions to generate variable domains of the heavy and light chains. The heavy chain 5' primers were designed to include a <italic>Sfi</italic>I site, and the light chain 3' primers include a <italic>Not</italic>I site. Light chain 5' primers were designed to include part of the linker region (Gly<sub>4</sub>Ser)<sub>3 </sub>and compatible with the heavy chain 3' primers (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Each variable region gene was separately amplified using hot start PCR in a reaction of 50 &#x003bc;l containing 5 &#x003bc;l cDNA and 1 &#x003bc;M of each 5' and 3' primer. This reaction was performed using the <italic>Taq </italic>polymerase (NEB, USA). The samples were heat at 94&#x000b0;C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 55&#x02013;65&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 72&#x000b0;C for 2 min. The final extension was performed at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Equal amount of PCR products were pooled into collections of V<sub>H</sub>, V<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>, and V<sub>&#x003bb; </sub>gene repertoire, and purified from the low melting temperature agarose gel according to standard protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. In the second PCR, heavy and light chains were assembled and amplified using <italic>pfu </italic>DNA Polymerase (Promaga, USA). The assembly PCR reaction contained equal molar mixture of the pooled heavy (V<sub>H</sub>) DNA and pooled light (V<sub>&#x003ba;</sub>, or V<sub>&#x003bb;</sub>) gene repertoire. The assembly reaction was cycled 5 times (94&#x000b0;C for 45 s, 60&#x000b0;C for 50 s, and 72&#x000b0;C for 60 s) without primers. The third reaction created a full-length scFv gene repertoire from the second PCR by PCR amplification in the presence of pull-through primers. This PCR extended the scFv gene from the <italic>Sfi</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I sites flanking scFv genes, using the following primers: PTfw (5'-CCT TTC TAT GCG GCC CAG CCG GCC ATG GCC-3') and PTrv (5'-CAG TCA TTC TCG ACT TGC GGC CGC ACG-3'). The reaction was performed using the <italic>Taq </italic>polymerase and 1 &#x003bc;l of assembled products from the second PCR. This pull-through PCR was cycled 30 times (94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 72&#x000b0;C for 2 min), and a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Then the samples were purified by a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) for the next step.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning of the scFv into pMod1 vector</title><p>The amplified scFv DNA and pMod1 phagemid vector were sequentially digested with <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Sfi</italic>I, by incubating at appropriate conditions for 10 hrs.

A total of 2.8 &#x003bc;g of digested scFv DNA were ligated into 5.5 &#x003bc;g of pMod1 phagemid vector, at a vector: insert molar ratio of 1:3, to generate the scFv-gene III fusion library.

For cholangiocarcinoma cell surface, approximately 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>cells growing in a 5-ml flask was used. Following blocking with 2% (w/v) skimmed milk powder in PBS (2% MPBS), a library containing between 10<sup>11 </sup>and 10<sup>12 </sup>phage particles were added and the plate was incubated for 2 hours at room temperature (RT; 25&#x02013;28&#x000b0;C). Non-bound phages were eliminated by washing 10&#x02013;20 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), followed by 10&#x02013;20 times washing with PBS. The bound phages were eluted by incubation with 50 &#x003bc;l of 1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l trypsin for 10 min, followed by 50 &#x003bc;l of 50 mM glycine- HCl pH 2.0 (immediately neutralized with 50 &#x003bc;l of 200 mM NaHPO<sub>4</sub>, pH7.5 after 10 min).
