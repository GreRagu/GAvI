Exposure to Cd in the general population is already close to the critical level, particularly in susceptible population groups and populations living close to polluting industries.</p><p>The biological half-life of Cd is very long, in the order of decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ehp-117-181">J&#x000e4;rup et al. 1998</xref>). The Cd concentration in urine (U-Cd) is mainly influenced by the body burden, and U-Cd is proportional to the concentration in the kidneys, until the onset of kidney damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ehp-117-181">J&#x000e4;rup et al. 1998</xref>). During long-term exposure, the concentration of U-Cd increases slowly and in proportion to the amount accumulated in the body.</p><p>It is well established that exposure to high levels of Cd may cause kidney damage leading to renal failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ehp-117-181">J&#x000e4;rup et al. 1998</xref>). The initial sign of Cd-induced renal lesions is tubular proteinuria, usually detected as an increased excretion of low-molecular-weight proteins, such as &#x003b1;-1-microglobulin (A1M), retinol-binding protein (RBP), and the enzyme <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc> -glucosaminidase (NAG). There is increasing evidence that early tubular damage may develop at low cumulative Cd doses (U-Cd = 1&#x02013;3 nmol/mmol creatinine) resulting from environmental Cd exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ehp-117-181">Buchet et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp-117-181">J&#x000e4;rup et al. 2000</xref>). Although these early changes to tubular function are not clinically significant in themselves, tubular damage may progress to glomerular damage and eventually to renal failure if Cd exposure is prolonged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp-117-181">&#x000c5;kesson et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ehp-117-181">Hellstr&#x000f6;m et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ehp-117-181">J&#x000e4;rup et al. 1998</xref>).</p><p>Although the renal toxicity of Cd is well known, the dose&#x02013;response relationship between Cd and kidney damage is still not well established at the low levels of exposure typically seen in environmentally exposed populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp-117-181">European Commission Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity, and the Environment (CSTEE) 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ehp-117-181">European Union 2007</xref>].

In the year before closure, Cd stack emissions from the site totaled 978 kg, representing nearly 30% of U.K. point source emissions for that year according to the Environment Agencies Pollution Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ehp-117-181">Environment Agency for England and Wales 2007</xref>). Zinc production had been taking place at the site for &#x0003e; 70 years, and during this time large amounts of other nephrotoxic metals, including lead, mercury, and arsenic, were also emitted. Because Cd is the most potent of these nephrotoxicants, and also has a very long biological half-life, we decided to focus on Cd in this study.</p><p>With close to 50,000 people living within 5 km of the smelter, there is concern that these emissions may have led to increased Cd exposure in the local population. It is thought that human exposure in this area may have occurred both directly through inhalation of contaminated air and indirectly through the ingestion of homegrown vegetables and house dust.</p><p>Soil sampling carried out in the vicinity of the smelter has shown a significant buildup of metal contamination in the soil up to 15 km from the smelter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp-117-181">Colgan et al. 2003</xref>). Soil Cd concentrations around smelting operations are closely related to the pattern of dispersion from the smelter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ehp-117-181">Hogervorst et al. 2007</xref>).</p><p>The aims of the present study were to assess Cd body burden (estimated by U-Cd) in a population sample living in a Cd-contaminated area and to assess the prevalence of early renal damage and any evidence of a dose&#x02013;response relationship. This is the first study of environmental Cd exposure and early kidney damage in a U.K. population.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We identified potential participants using the National Health Service database of patients registered with general practitioners (the Exeter System) in the area. We stratified these by age, sex, and estimated exposure before we took a random sample. We invited a total of 865 people to take part in the study. We asked participants to complete a short questionnaire regarding residential, occupational, and medical history, smoking, and consumption of home-grown vegetables, as well as any use of a private well. We also asked them to provide one spot morning urine sample; samples were frozen on the day of collection and kept frozen until analysis. Ethical approval for the study was granted by Bristol South and Central Ethics Committee, and all participants provided their written informed consent before data collection.</p><p>We used dispersion modeling to identify the potentially exposed population and to stratify this population into high-, medium-, and low-exposure groups before recruitment. The use of air dispersion modeling as the exposure assessment method is described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ehp-117-181">Hodgson et al. (2007)</xref>. We used the Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System (ADMS)-Urban (version 2.0; Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants, Cambridge, UK) to model Cd emissions from the site between 1996 and 2002 (excluding 1997 because of the poor quality of local meteorological data for that year). During this time, up to 13 stacks were emitting Cd to air. We used emissions data collected under the Integrated Pollution Control legislation, and held by Bridgewater Public Registry, Bristol, in the model, along with stack details (height, diameter, etc.) provided by Bristol City Council. We used hourly sequential meteorological data from the Bristol Weather Centre and Filton Meteorological station; these data were provided by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ehp-117-181">British Atmospheric Data Centre (2006)</xref>. Ambient air Cd concentrations in the United Kingdom are typically between 0.05 and 1.0 ng/m<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ehp-117-181">Baker 2001</xref>), so we added a background concentration of 0.5 ng/m<sup>3</sup> to the model. We validated the model output from the year 2000 using the annual averages from six air monitoring sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp-117-181">Figure 1</xref>). The air monitoring data were provided by Bristol City Council and Stanger/National Physical Laboratory (Middlesex, England). The final model used was an average of the output for 1996&#x02013;2002 (excluding 1997).</p><p>Urine samples were analyzed for Cd (U-Cd) and for three biomarkers of tubular damage [NAG (U-NAG), RBP (U-RBP), and A1M (U-A1M)]. Analysis was carried out by the Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL) in Buxton, United Kingdom. The HSL determined U-Cd using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, U-NAG by fixed time incubation, U-RBP by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and U-A1M by a non-competitive immunoassay. The HSL carried out all assays according to standard operating procedures; HSL participates in inter-laboratory quality control procedures. We adjusted biomarkers of both dose (U-Cd) and effect (U-NAG, U-RBP, and U-A1M) for urinary creatinine to account for differences in urine concentration. The HSL calculated reference values for U-NAG and U-RBP by the HSL using the 97.5th percentiles from a U.K. cohort of 320 working subjects with no history of exposure to nephrotoxins (Mason H, personal communication). We based the U-A1M reference level on the 95th percentile of a nonexposed, healthy Swedish population of working age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ehp-117-181">Tencer et al. 1996</xref>).</p><p>We assessed the relationship between natural log (ln) U-Cd and a set of independent variables&#x02014;sex, age, ADMS category, and smoking status&#x02014;in SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) using a linear regression model. We used the median value as the representative concentration for each ADMS category.</p><p>Urinary biomarkers of both dose and effect were log-normally distributed and when plotted did not show a nonlinear relationship. We therefore used Pearson&#x02019;s two-tailed correlation coefficient to test for correlation on the log-transformed data.</p><p>We calculated odds ratios for the prevalence of U-NAG above the reference level in SPSS using a logistic regression model. We chose U-Cd categories <italic>a priori</italic> based on the Osteoporosis&#x02014;Cadmium as a Risk Factor (OSCAR) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp-117-181">J&#x000e4;rup et al. 2000</xref>). We used U-Cd &#x0003c; 0.3 nmol/mmol creatinine as the reference group and adjusted the analysis for sex. We used Egret software (version 3.2; Cytel Software Corp., Cambridge, MA, USA) to test for trend across the odds ratios. We assessed statistical significance at the 95% level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 865 adults invited to take part in the study, 180 (74 men, 106 women) participated (21%). The participation rate was 17% and 24% for men and women, respectively.

There were no significant differences between responders and nonresponders in terms of socioeconomic status. A total of 109 participants (40 men and 69 women; 61%) were never-smokers, 36 (19 men, 17 women; 20%) had smoked in the past, and 32 (13 men, 19 women; 18%) were current smokers; smoking data were not available for three participants. Seventeen participants (15 men, 2 women) reported that they had been employed at the smelter; data on employment at the smelter were not available for three participants.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp-117-181">Figure 1</xref> shows the modeled Cd levels and the monitoring station locations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ehp-117-181">Figure 2</xref> shows modeled and monitored annual averages of Cd for the year 2000 for the six monitoring sites.

Ambient air Cd concentrations at each of the six monitoring sites exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) <italic>Air Quality Guidelines for Europe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ehp-117-181">WHO 2000</xref>) of 5 ng/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>We found median U-Cd concentrations of 0.22 nmol/mmol creatinine (nonsmoking 0.18/smoking 0.40) and 0.34 nmol/mmol creatinine (nonsmoking 0.31/smoking 0.46) in nonoccupationally exposed men and women, respectively.

The dose&#x02013;response trend did not change when we excluded current and past smokers, although the total number of cases was decreased (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ehp-117-181">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found median U-Cd concentrations in the Avonmouth pilot sample of 0.18 and 0.31 nmol/mmol creatinine in nonoccupationally exposed nonsmoking men and women, respectively. The corresponding data for smokers were 0.40 in men and 0.46 in women. Overall, six participants (3.3%) had U-Cd values greater than the 1 nmol/mmol creatinine level at which a 10% increased prevalence of proteinuria was found in the OSCAR study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp-117-181">J&#x000e4;rup et al. 2000</xref>). Fourteen participants (7.8%) had U-Cd &#x0003e; 0.8 nmol/mmol creatinine, the recently revised German reference value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ehp-117-181">Wilhelm et al. 2004</xref>). Forty-five participants (25%) had U-Cd levels greater than 0.5 nmol/mmol creatinine, the lower limit of potential risk of kidney damage suggested by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp-117-181">CSTEE (2004)</xref>.</p><p>We found significant dose&#x02013;effect relationships between U-Cd and U-NAG in both men and women and a significant dose&#x02013;effect relationship between U-Cd and U-A1M in women. We also found a significant dose-dependent trend in the prevalence of early renal damage, as assessed by U-NAG, and this trend persisted after exclusion of current and past smokers. The results of this study would suggest that U-NAG is the most sensitive of the biomarkers of tubular damage investigated. U-NAG is an intracellular enzyme located mainly in the lysosomes of proximal tubular epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ehp-117-181">Fels et al. 1994</xref>). Its presence in urine therefore represents disruption of these cells. Previous studies have also identified U-NAG as a highly sensitive indicator of Cd tubular toxicity in both humans and in the animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ehp-117-181">Brz&#x000f3;ska et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Modeled atmospheric concentrations identified populations with potential Cd exposure from the smelter site (either via direct inhalation when the smelter was operating or indirect inhalation of household dust, or via ingestion of vegetables grown on Cd-contaminated soil). There was a good correlation between ADMS-modeled levels and monitoring data, suggesting that the modeled values were valid estimates of Cd exposure from the smelter; however, we found that the model underestimated concentrations. One possible reason for this underestimation is that fugitive emissions, which are thought to have been significant, could not be included in the model because these were never quantified.</p><p>In addition to Cd, the smelter in Avonmouth also emitted arsenic, lead, and mercury, all of which are nephrotoxic. It is likely that these metals followed a pattern of dispersion very similar to that of Cd because they were emitted from the same stacks and share similar chemical properties. The similar patterns of exposure mean that it is not possible to separate the effects of Cd from those of the other nephrotoxins; our finding could therefore result from exposure to a mix of several nephrotoxic metals.</p><p>Because Cd has a long half-life in the kidney, the use of only the current residential address in the exposure estimate is likely to lead to random misclassification of exposure, such that any relationship between modeled air Cd concentrations/distance from smelter and U-Cd would be biased toward the null.</p><p>Consumption of homegrown vegetables has been identified as a probable Cd exposure pathway, most recently in a Swedish population living close to a Cd battery factory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ehp-117-181">Hellstr&#x000f6;m et al. 2007</xref>). However, in the present study, we found no correlation between consumption of homegrown vegetables and U-Cd (data not shown), possibly because the questionnaire did not adequately assess the frequency of consumption, or because of the relatively small sample size. Further information on garden soil Cd concentrations and pH is needed to adequately assess the risk posed by this pathway in the Avonmouth area.</p><p>In addition to the anticipated Cd exposure from the smelter, individuals will have been exposed to Cd from other sources, in particular, from tobacco smoke, which is known to be a major source of Cd exposure. In our study, mean U-Cd levels in &#x0201c;ever-smokers&#x0201d; were approximately twice those of &#x0201c;never-smokers&#x0201d;; this is similar to findings in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ehp-117-181">J&#x000e4;rup et al. 1998</xref>).</p><p>The results identify women as a particularly susceptible group. U-Cd concentrations were significantly higher in women than in men; this difference between the sexes is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ehp-117-181">Vahter et al. 2007</xref>). One explanation for this difference may be that the iron deficiency commonly seen among women of childbearing age results in the up-regulation of the iron channels through which both Cd and iron are absorbed from the digestive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ehp-117-181">Berglund et al. 1994</xref>).</p><p>The lead/zinc smelter in Avonmouth closed in 2003, and as a result, atmospheric Cd concentrations in the area have been reduced dramatically. In the year after closure of the smelter (2004), ambient air concentrations at four of the monitoring sites (two monitoring sites were no longer in operation) were approximately 24% of those in the year before closure (2002). However, emissions from the smelter are known to have resulted in elevated soil concentrations up to 15 km from the site, and soil is therefore likely to be a continuing source of exposure in the area. Direct airborne exposure has been shown to play a minor role in the exposure of people living near a Cd-emitting plant, even when the plant was operating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ehp-117-181">Hellstr&#x000f6;m et al. 2007</xref>). Indirect exposures, such as consumption of homegrown vegetables grown on contaminated soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ehp-117-181">Hellstr&#x000f6;m et al. 2007</xref>) or inhalation of contaminated household dust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ehp-117-181">Hogervorst et al. 2007</xref>), are more important pathways of exposure. It is clear that such exposures continue several decades after closure of the Cd-emitting plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ehp-117-181">Hellstr&#x000f6;m et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ehp-117-181">Hogervorst et al. 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>U-Cd concentrations were close to levels where kidney and bone effects have been found.
