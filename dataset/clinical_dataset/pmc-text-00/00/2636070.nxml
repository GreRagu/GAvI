The inclusioncriteria were demonstrated raised ICP (CSF opening pressure&#x0003e;250 mm H<sub>2</sub>O), visual loss as evidenced by deteriorating visualfields or visual acuity and ultrasonologically demonstrableincreased subarachnoid fluid in the retrobulbar optic nerve.All patients were on maximum tolerable medical therapyof oral acetazolamide up to 2000 mg/day in four divideddoses, oral glycerol 30 ml three times/day (TID) and in acutecases IV mannitol 100 ml TID. The CVT patients were on oralanticoagulation with nicoumalin to maintain a prothrombintime INR of 2 to 3. Exclusion criteria included absence of visualloss in the presence of papilledema and raised ICP, enlargedblind spot being the only visual field change, disc edema dueto other causes (such as optic neuritis)and patients not availablefor follow-up for at least three months.</p><p>A detailed history regarding patient demographics,presenting complaints including visual and non-visualsymptoms of papilledema and raised ICP and details of medicalor surgical treatment received, was taken. All patients underwenta detailed neurological evaluation including history, clinicalexamination, neuroimaging studies with magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) and CSF studies including opening pressurerecording and CSF composition. Relevant investigations weredone to detect any metabolic, endocrine or hematologic causefor the raised ICP or CVT. CSF opening pressures were recordedhigh with normal CSF composition in all patients. Ocularparameters (assessed at baseline and follow-up at four days,two weeks, one month, three months and subsequent follow-up) included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), perimetry,stereoscopic funduscopy, pupillary light response, stereoscopicfundus photography and measurement of optic nerve sheathdiameter on B-scan ultrasonography (USG).</p><p>Best-corrected visual acuity was recorded using Snellen&#x02032;schart. Snellen visual acuity was converted to the logarithm ofthe minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity for thepurpose of analysis. Ishihara&#x02032;s pseudoisochromatic chart wasused to assess color vision in all patients. Visual field assessmentwas performed using a Humphrey field analyzer and eithera full field suprathreshold program or a SITA standard 30-2threshold test. The same algorithm was used for follow-up ineach individual patient. Visual field defects were graded fromGrade 1 to 5 as per the criteria described by Wall and Georgefor automated perimetry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> and scored as such so that a lowernumber indicated a better field.</p><p>Direct and consensual pupillary reactions were assessedand scored as numbers 0 to 3 (0-non-reactive, 1-sluggishlyreactive, 2-ill sustained and 3-brisk) for analysis. Ocularmotility evaluation was performed. Indirect ophthalmoscopy,slit-lamp biomicroscopy with 90D lens and stereoscopicfundus photography was performed in all eyes. The degree ofpapilledema of each eye was graded using the Frisen&#x02032;s stagingscheme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> from Stage 0 to 5, for the purpose of analysis. All eyesunderwent orbital echography to assess the optic nerve sheathdiameter and it was found increased in all eyes.</p><p>Optic nerve sheath decompression was performed using amedial transconjunctival approach under general anesthesia.After a 270 degree medial peritomy, the medial rectus wastagged with 6-0 polygalactin and the muscle disinserted.The globe was fully abducted with the help of a &#x02032;base-ball&#x02032;traction suture placed on the sclera at the site of the medialrectus disinsertion. The optic nerve was exposed under theoperating microscope using malleable retractors and tailedcotton applicators to maneuver the orbital fat. The shortposterior ciliary vessels were gently reflected with a nervehook or a cotton-tipped applicator and an avascular area ofanterior optic nerve sheath was incised using a side-port knifeused in cataract surgery or MVR Unitome 5560. An incisionabout 4 to 5 mm in length was made about 2 mm posterior tothe junction of the globe and the nerve. Adhesions betweenthe nerve and dura were gently lysed by movement of a Fishertenotomy hook within the subarachnoid space. Cerebrospinalfluid was drained on incision of the sheath, confirming thefenestration. Base-ball traction sutures were released, themedial rectus reinserted and the conjunctiva closed withrunning suture. Bilateral ONSD was done in all cases exceptin two patients who did not have significant visual loss inone eye. Peroperatively a five-day course of intravenousceftriaxone 2 g/day in two divided doses was started. Patientswere discharged on the fifth postoperative day. Complicationsif any were recorded during each postoperative follow-upvisit.</p><p>To obtain a picture of clinical relevance, functional outcomewas categorized into &#x02033;qualified success&#x02033; and &#x02033;success&#x02033;.Qualified success or stabilization of visual function wasdefined as improvement or worsening of less than two lineson the Snellen acuity or maintenance of existing Snellen acuity,visual field improvement or worsening less than one grade ofstaging scheme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> or maintenance of existing visual field at threemonths follow-up and subsequent follow-up visits. Success wasdefined as improvement in visual acuity by two or more lines ofSnellen&#x02032;s acuity or an increase in the visual field grading by atleast one grade or more as per the grading criteria for automatedperimetry in papilledema.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Surgical &#x02032;success&#x02032; was consideredin terms of resolution of papilledema on funduscopy andechographic evidence of optic nerve sheath diameter reduction.Resolution of papilledema was considered &#x02032;successful&#x02032; if the discappearance improved by at least one stage or more of Frisen&#x02032;sstaging scheme.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> &#x02033;Worsening&#x02033; in visual function was definedas decrease in visual acuity by two lines or more of Snellen&#x02032;sacuity and a decrease in visual field grading by at least onegrade or more.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></p><p>The data were analyzed as follows. Descriptive statisticswere computed for the range, mean and standard deviationfor quantitative variable and category frequency counts andpercentages for qualitative variable. In the inferential statisticalanalysis, one-way repeated measures analysis of variance(RMANOVA), with Pillai&#x02032;s trace as the statistical criterionwas used to compare the means of variables obtained fromthe same group at several different points in time. It was alsoused to compare outcome between the groups across time.Subsequently the paired t test was used to make comparisonsbetween means at two points in time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Forty-one eyes of 21 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteriaunderwent ONSD. There was a female preponderance with15 females and six males. The age range was 18 to 48 years withmean (SD) of 29.5 (&#x000b1;8.2) years. The patients were divided intothree groups based on the cause of IH: this included Group Iwith IIH in five patients (10 eyes), Group II with postpartumCVT in seven patients (14 eyes) and Group III with other causesof CVT in nine patients (17 eyes). Seven eyes (7/41) with visualacuity of absent light perception at presentation were notincluded for analysis of functional outcome and their functionaloutcome is given separately.</p><p>Headache and vomiting were present in 18/21 patientspreceding complaints of visual loss. Three patients, however,presented with advanced visual loss only. Sixth nerve palsyaccounted for the far majority of non-visual neurologicaldeficits in 14/21 patients. Only two patients had other focalneurological deficits.</p><p>Thirty-two of 34 eyes (94%) showed either improvement(50%) or maintenance (44%) of preoperative BCVA at threemonths follow-up with only 2/34 eyes of one patient showingpostoperative worsening [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

The two main suggested mechanismsinclude obliteration of the subarachnoid space surrounding theoptic nerve by fibroblast proliferation, preventing CSF pressuretransmission distal to the operative site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> and the second beingthe creation of a dural fistula which allows egress of CSFfrom the operative site.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> Findings which favor the secondhypothesis include relief of headache following ONSD andbilateral improvement in visual function following unilateralsurgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> Optic nerve sheath decompression hasbeen performed using different approaches to the optic nerve likemedial transconjunctival orbitotomy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> lateral orbitotomy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> and a lateral canthotomyapproach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> Overall, the results aresimilar with both medial and lateral approaches.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></p><p>There is increasing evidence on the efficacy of ONSD inimproving or preserving vision in patients with IH, especiallyIIH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> Thebenefits of ONSD in stabilizing vision in IIH, have also been shown to be applicable in IH due to othercauses like CVT, intracranial tumors and infections.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>Previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> have shown that ONSD in CVT-relatedIH was visually beneficial. Visual loss in CVT is multifactorial andincludes pressure effect of transmitted ICP on the optic nerveand vascular compromise to the optic nerve and rest of theoptic pathway due to thrombosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> One could expect pooreroutcomes after the procedure in this group of patients, wherevascular factors compromised recovery. However, 22/24 eyeswith CVT of any cause showed stabilization or improvementduring the study period. Hence ONSD should be consideredin all patients with visual loss due to CVT. Anecdotally, it wasnoted that dramatic improvements in visual acuity and fieldswere seen more frequently in patients with IIH than those withCVT. We recommend caution in prognosticating outcome inpatients with CVT and advanced visual loss for this reason.</p><p>The overall visual acuity and visual field outcome at threemonths follow-up showed significant improvement and thebenefits of the procedure accrued to all the three etiologicalgroups. The improvement in visual function occurred in theearly postoperative period which was maintained at threemonths follow-up. Follow-up at six months and beyondshowed a favorable trend in visual function in 27/34 eyes.Reduction in optic nerve sheath diameter and resolution ofpapilledema, indicators of surgical success of ONSD showedstatistically significant change following ONSD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> Periodicultrasonic evaluation of retrobulbar optic nerve sheath diameteris advisable, as partially atrophic discs would not show asignificant swelling to alert the physician about possible long-term surgical closure of the shunt.</p><p>Presence of optic disc pallor in association with chronicpapilledema and advanced visual loss is not a contraindicationfor surgery. Sergott <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> showed that 3/23 eyes with opticdisc pallor regained 20/20 vision. However, the experienceof other studies was not encouraging for similar cases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> Ten eyes with disc swelling and pallor showed no dramaticfunctional improvement in our study. However, they all showedstabilization and six had improved vision. We advocate ONSDfor all patients with some retained visual acuity and optic discpallor in an edematous disc, to preserve residual vision. Foureyes of two patients with absent light perception regainedambulatory vision almost one month after surgery. Both thesepatients had rapid loss of vision due to postpartum CVT andboth received intravenous methylprednisolone prior to surgery.The remaining three eyes with absent light perception hadgradual loss of vision and did not benefit from surgery. Theprobable explanation is that in acute loss of vision there existsome fibers which remain hypofunctional or nonfunctionaland can regain functional viability after a pressure-relievingoperation. However, it is unlikely that if the condition persistsfor several weeks, these axons would remain viable.</p><p>The complications were benign and transient. The reportedincidence of complications ranges from 2 to 35%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> and theseinclude pupillary atony, transient diplopia, lost medial rectusmuscle, sudden loss of vision due to traumatic optic neuropathyand central retinal artery occlusion. The occurrence of orbitalcellulitis as a complication of ONSD has not been reportedin the literature. The reported incidence of late visual lossranges from 10 to 40%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> Rapid loss of vision one monthpostoperatively following an initial improvement was seen intwo eyes (10%) and this was similar to that experienced by fivepatients reported by Corbett <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> The patient in our studyand one patient in the study by Corbett <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> had CVT as theunderlying cause of raised ICP. Ischemia of the optic nerve dueto thrombotic disease may have been the precipitating factor.</p><p>One of the limitations of this study is that it is a prospectivenonrandomized noncomparative study where ONSD wasthe primary surgery done rather than a neurosurgical shunt,which classically, is the conventional paradigm. A randomizedstudy would include primary shunt treatment as the othertreatment alternative for a short and long-term follow-up study.More number of patients would be necessary if the power ofsuch a study is to be relevant. The second limitation being theshort follow-up period. Long-term follow-up of these patientsincluding ultrasonic evaluation of the optic nerve sheathdiameter is mandatory as there is always the risk of closure offiltration site and a repeat procedure may be required.</p><p>In conclusion ONSD is effective in improving or maintainingvision in patients with IIH and visual loss. This study has alsoestablished the effectiveness of ONSD in cases of visual loss inCVT. With proper attention to detail, it is a safe procedure withminimal complications. Early surgical intervention is associatedwith better visual outcome. However, the study cannot makespecific recommendations at this time, of the ideal stage atwhich to intervene and what the most sensitive parameters are,of early decompensation, which could be used as guidelinesto decompress.</p><p>The benefit of ONSD in preserving residual vision extendsto eyes with chronic papilledema, disc pallor and advancedvisual loss.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Dr.
