The HCV genome contains an RNA structure resembling an iron responsive element (IRE) in its internal ribosome entry site (IRES) structural domain IV (dIV). An IRE is a stem loop structure used to control the expression of eukaryotic proteins involved in iron homeostasis by either inhibiting ribosomal binding or protecting the mRNA from nuclease degradation.

Fifty percent of acute infections progress to chronic liver infection and can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A correlation between chronic HCV infection and intracellular iron homeostasis has been empirically established, but the mechanism of this relationship is not understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Increased intracellular iron concentration has been shown to enhance HCV IRES-dependent translation, and two cellular factors, p85 and p110, bind to both the HCV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and the iron responsive element (IRE) in an iron-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Serum ferritin and hepatic iron concentrations are frequently elevated in chronically infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and hepatic iron concentration has been used as a predictor of response to interferon therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>An RNA structural element located at the junction between the open reading frame (ORF) and the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the HCV genome bears striking structural and sequential similarities to the iron responsive element (IRE), an RNA structure found in some eukaryotic mRNA that controls gene expression in response to intracellular iron concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. If this HCV RNA element functions as an authentic IRE, then iron depletion in an HCV infected cell would be expected to specifically inhibit viral protein expression and could potentially decrease subsequent viral replication. A possible relationship between this HCV RNA structure and the IRE was investigated.</p><p>HCV belongs to the <italic>Hepacivirus </italic>genus of the <italic>Flaviviridae </italic>family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The RNA genome is approximately 9.6 kb and serves as a template for both translation and replication. The single long ORF is flanked at the 5' and 3' ends by highly structured UTRs, which are essential for initiation of translation and replication, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The hepacivirus and pestivirus genera of <italic>Flaviviridae </italic>initiate translation via virtually identical non-scanning cap-independent mechanisms that utilize an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to recruit and assemble the ribosome directly at the initiation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The HCV IRES (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) is a complex and highly conserved RNA structure that is located predominantly within 5' UTR, but is believed to extend into the 5' proximal region of the ORF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It is canonically divided into four structural domains. Domain I is required for efficient viral replication and is not required for viral translation. Domains II and III are necessary and sufficient to recruit and assemble the ribosome at the start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The domain IV (dIV) RNA structure, which is not essential for efficient translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and is unique to hepaciviruses, has no known function. The pestivirus IRES contains structural domains that are analogous to HCV IRES domains I-III, but lacks domain IV. The border between the 5' UTR and the ORF of the pestivirus genome is believed to be unstructured.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The HCV 5'UTR secondary structure</bold>. The base pairing convention described by Honda <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] is used to depict the predicted base pairing in the HCV IRES RNA structure for genotype 1b. The structural domains are labelled I-IV. The authentic HCV start codon at HCV nt 342&#x02013;344 is boxed. The wild type HCV IRES dIV RNA sequence used in this study represents HCV nt 331&#x02013;354.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1477-5751-8-4-1"/></fig><p>The authentic HCV initiation codon resides in the terminal loop of the RNA hairpin structure in the HCV IRES dIV. This structure is unlikely to be tolerated in the RNA binding cleft of the ribosome while the initiation codon occupies the ribosomal P site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and the ribosomal toeprint on the HCV genome at +15 from the start codon is characteristic of a eukaryotic ribosome bound to unstructured mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Consequently, increased stability of the HCV IRES dIV structure predictably decreases the efficiency of HCV IRES-dependent translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, the HCV IRES dIV structure must presumably melt to allow the N-terminus of the HCV polyprotein to be translated from the codons in the 5' region of the ORF that are involved in the HCV IRES dIV RNA structure. The apparent requirement that the HCV IRES dIV structure unwinds to allow translation initiation suggests that its presumed viral function occurs either before the ribosome has been recruited to the mRNA or after the translating ribosome has exited the start site, which is consistent with a regulatory RNA element.</p><p>The IRE is an example of a translation regulatory RNA element that does not otherwise actively participate in the translation initiation mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The interaction between the IRE and its cognate binding partner, an iron regulatory protein (IRP1 or IRP2), either inhibits gene expression by inhibiting 40S ribosomal subunit binding or enhances gene expression by protecting the mRNA from nuclease degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], depending on where the IRE is located in the mRNA. To inhibit ribosomal binding, the IRE must reside within the 40S ribosomal subunit binding site near the 5' cap structure. The IRE cannot bind to the 40S ribosomal subunit while it is bound to an IRP, but it has little effect on the translation initiation efficiency when it is not bound by an IRP. The active IRP concentration is controlled by the intracellular iron concentration. IRP1 is an aconitase enzyme conformer that is formed when the intracellular iron concentration is insufficient to form the characteristic aconitase ironsulfur cluster. IRP2 is homologous to IRP1 but does not form the aconitase iron-sulfur cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Like the HCV IRES dIV structure, the IRE must melt to allow the mRNA to occupy the ribosomal RNA binding cleft.</p><p>The HCV IRES dIV RNA structure shares many of the IRE consensus structural characteristics[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], most closely resembling the human erythroidspecific &#x003b4;-aminolevulinic acid synthase (eALAS) IRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, boxed inset). The eALAS IRE stem contains an unpaired C residue in the 5' arm (C-bulge) that is separated from the terminal loop by 5 base pairs. The C-bulge is implicated in a sequence-specific binding interaction with the IRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A prominent feature of the IRE terminal loop is an intraloop C-G base pair, which is required for its interaction with an IRP. The C-G intraloop base pair solvent-exposes the guanine base at the center of the resultant terminal tri-loop, which is also required for sequence-specific high-affinity binding to the IRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The consensus sequence of the IRE terminal loop consists of six bases, the first five of which are usually CAGUG. The sixth base can be any nucleotide, so long as it cannot base pair with C. The HCV IRES dIV RNA hairpin incorporates similar features, including a C-containing bulge in 5' arm of the stem that is separated from the terminal loop by five base pairs and the potential to form an intraloop C-G pair. In fact, the HCV IRES dIV stem differs from the consensus C-bulge IRE in only three significant ways (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, boxed inset). It has an extra adenosine residue in the terminal loop, two extra adenosine residues in the 3' arm of the stem directly across from the unpaired cytosine residue, and an adenosine residue instead of a guanosine residue at the apex of the putative tri-loop formed by the intraloop C-G base pair. A mutant HCV IRES dIV structure in which all three differences are reconciled would fit the consensus definition of an authentic IRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and would be expected to bind to an IRP with wild type affinity.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>RNA sequences and secondary structures</bold>.

Inset: the eALAS IRE and wild type HCV IRES dIV RNA are boxed for comparison.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1477-5751-8-4-2"/></fig><p>If HCV were to utilize an IRE-like mechanism to control viral expression, the RNA structure used for this regulation must be positioned within the 40S ribosomal subunit binding site. In sharp contrast to normal eukaryotic cap-dependent translation, the HCV IRES-dependent translation initiation mechanism requires that the 40S ribosomal subunit binds directly to the HCV genomic RNA sequence flanking the 5' UTR-ORF boundary to allow the start codon to occupy the ribosomal P site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This mechanism would force at least part of any putative IRE-like RNA element into the ORF. Thus the HCV IRES dIV structure is properly positioned in the HCV mRNA to function as an IRE-like RNA element.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>RNA binding to hIRP1</title><p>Since the HCV IRES dIV structure differs from the consensus IRE at only three characteristics, a mutant RNA panel was constructed to evaluate the relative binding contribution of each characteristic. The panel systematically mutated the wild type HCV IRES dIV structure to a consensus IRE structure (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were used to detect binding interactions between hIRP1 and the RNA species shown.

Six of the mutant RNA sequences (ET1+2, ET3, ET2, ET1+3, ET2+3, ET1+2+3) and the eALAS IRE detectably bound to hIRP1 at an hIRP1 concentration of 240 ng (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). No detectable binding to hIRP1 was observed for the wild type HCV IRES dIV, ET1, ET2, or the negative control IRE.

Strictly speaking, however, the HCV IRES mechanism describes the initiation of translation, not necessarily its regulation. The HCV IRES domains I-III have been well characterized in recent years, and much is known about the roles of these structures in the recruitment and assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome on the HCV RNA genome. The role of domain IV, however, remains enigmatic. It is not required for efficient initiation and is not present in the closely related pestivirus IRES, yet it is conserved across all HCV genotypes. Mutational analysis of this structure demonstrated only a modest relationship between HCV IRES-dependent translational efficiency and structural stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This observation might simply reflect the effect of RNA structure near the start codon, and does not necessarily imply a role in translation initiation. These observations are consistent with a regulatory RNA element that modulates translation efficiency in response to an appropriate biological signal but does not otherwise participate directly in the recruitment and assembly of the ribosome. The IRE-IRP mechanism represents a useful model for this type of interaction.</p><p>A cursory comparison of the structure and genomic location of the HCV IRES dIV RNA structure to the C-bulge eALAS IRE is provocative and suggests a correlated similarity of function. The wild type HCV IRES dIV RNA does not measurably bind to hIRP1, however, demonstrating that it is not an authentic IRE. The ET1+2+3 RNA, which adheres to the consensus definition of an IRE, bound to IRP1 with wild type efficiency as expected. Deleting the two A residues in the bulge of the wild type HCV IRES dIV RNA (the ET3 effect) contributed the greatest relative effect on binding affinity, followed by deletion of an A residue in the terminal loop (the ET2 effect), suggesting the importance of the correct three dimensional RNA structure on hIRP1 binding. The G residue at the apex of the terminal tri-loop and C-bulge residue are conserved in the consensus IRE and are presumably required for sequence-specific interactions between the IRE and recognition motifs on the IRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These residues are displayed in three dimensions relative to each other by the structural features of the stem and the terminal loop. Altering the IRE structure likely misaligns the recognition nucleotides with their respective recognition motifs on hIRP1. A well-defined and rigid IRE binding pocket would not accept a stem of the wrong shape, regardless of the sequential positions of the recognition nucleotides. The ET2 and ET3 effects are consistent with the reported IRE characteristics required for efficient IRE-IRP interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Mutating the A residue of the start codon to a G residue (the ET1 effect), a sequence-only mutation, showed the least effect on hIRP1 binding. The ET1 effect was unexpected, since the literature reports that the G residue in the terminal loop is essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Either purine residue in this position yielded significant IRP1 binding in our hands, with only a slight preference for G (compare ET2+3 to ET1+2+3 in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The primary conclusion from this work is that the wild type HCV IRES dIV RNA structure is not an authentic IRE, as it does not bind appreciably to the recombinant IRP1 protein. The hypothesis that HCV utilizes this structure to control viral expression by an IRE-like mechanism remains viable, although a putative cellular or viral factor that fulfils the analogous IRP function must be identified to properly evaluate this hypothesis. The p85 and p100 proteins that have been recently shown to bind to both the HCV IRES and the iron responsive element with high affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] could serve this purpose. For now, the role of the highly conserved HCV IRES dIV structure remains unresolved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of human IRP1</title><p>Human IRP1 (hIRP1) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was expressed and purified as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] with some modifications.

Diluted hIRP1 was incubated with 5.2 nM &#x003b1;<sup>32</sup>P-CTP labeled RNA. Complexed and free RNA species were resolved on a discontinuous native gel (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), visualized and quantified as previously described. The reported <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d </italic></sub>is an average of three independent experiments and was calculated by nonlinear curve fit using the Origin program (MicroCal)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Calculations assumed that the plateau in the curve represents complete RNA binding and that there was only one hIRP1 binding site on the RNA. To allow for the possibility that the hIRP1-RNA complexes might have dissociated during resolution on the native gel, the complex bands were quantified to include all radioactivity that ran ahead of these complexes with respect to the control lane lacking hIRP1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ET synthesized and purified the RNA and hIRP1, carried out the EMSA experiments, and helped draft the manuscript.
