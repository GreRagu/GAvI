The retrotransposable element R2 exclusively inserts into the 28S rRNA genes where it establishes long-term, stable relationships with its animal hosts. Previous studies with laboratory stocks of <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic> have suggested that control over R2 retrotransposition resides within the rDNA loci. In this report, we sampled 180 rDNA loci of animals collected from two natural populations of <italic>D. simulans</italic>. The two populations were found to have similar patterns of R2 activity. About half of the rDNA loci supported no or very low levels of R2 transcripts with no evidence of R2 retrotransposition. The remaining half of the rDNA loci had levels of R2 transcripts that varied in a continuous manner over almost a 100-fold range and did support new retrotransposition events. Structural analysis of the rDNA loci in 18 lines that spanned the range of R2 transcript levels in these populations revealed that R2 number and rDNA locus size varied 2-fold; however, R2 activity was not readily correlated with either of these parameters. Instead R2 activity was best correlated with the distribution of elements within the rDNA locus. Loci with no activity had larger contiguous blocks of rDNA units free of R2-insertions. These data suggest a model in which frequent recombination within the rDNA locus continually redistributes R2-inserted units resulting in changing levels of R2 activity within individual loci and persistent R2 activity within the population.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Transposable elements are abundant selfish components of all eukaryotic genomes. Despite the elaborate mechanisms eukaryotes have evolved to control these elements, they continue to proliferate. Here, we study R2 retrotransposons, highly successful elements that only insert into a site within the 28S rRNA genes of animals. In two natural populations of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we show that R2 activity is directly linked to the level of R2 transcripts within each fly. The level of R2 transcripts is in turn linked to properties of the tandemly arranged rRNA genes, also known as the nucleolar organizer or rDNA locus. R2 transcript levels appear to depend upon the distribution of R2-inserted units within the rDNA locus, rather than the number of R2 insertions or the total size of the locus. Our findings suggest that R2 transcripts and hence activity can be prevented only when a fly can identify one or more large regions of the rDNA locus free of R2-inserted units. Because recombinations continually change the number and position of rDNA units with R2 insertions, individual loci switch between R2 inactivity and activity, thus perpetuating the long-term survival of R2 elements.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The abundant transposable elements present in eukaryotes have over the course of evolution helped shape the size, structure and expression of their genomes.

In spite of these controls, in most populations new insertions occur continuously at low levels.

However, it remains uncertain as to whether transposable elements maintain themselves by the inability of the control mechanisms to prevent all events, or the loss of transposable element control in a fraction of the individuals in a population.</p><p>The ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes of eukaryotes are composed of hundreds to thousands of tandemly repeated units (the rDNA loci). Mature 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNAs are processed from the single transcript of each rDNA unit. Frequent recombination (unequal crossovers) within these rDNA loci removes sequence variation, a process referred to as concerted evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Concerted evolution is so efficient almost no nucleotide sequence variation exists between the different rDNA units of a locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Ganley1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Stage1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Given this ability of the locus to rid itself of variation, it is surprising that the rDNA locus is home to many specialized transposable elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Kojima1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, R1 and R2 are non-LTR retrotransposable elements that insert specifically into the 28S rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000386-g001">Figure 1</xref>). R1 and R2 are highly adept at maintaining themselves in the rDNA locus. They are found in most arthropods and appear to have been vertically inherited since the origin of the phylum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Burke1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Malik1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Minor, if any, influence on the level of R2 activity was found associated with the autosomes. Analysis of the rDNA loci from the active and inactive stocks revealed that the numbers of R2 elements in the active stocks were on average twice that found in the inactive stocks. The R2 elements in the active stocks were distributed throughout the rDNA locus suggesting a model in which a high density of R2 elements prevents the host from activating the needed number of uninserted rDNA units without also activating R2-inserted units.</p><p>Because the active and inactive stocks used in these studies had been maintained in the laboratory for over 10 years, and considerable changes in the structure of the rDNA locus had occurred during that time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Zhang3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, it was unclear whether R2 activity in these laboratory stocks were an accurate reflection of the levels and pattern of R2 activity in natural populations. Here we studied R2 element activity in two populations of <italic>D. simulans</italic> immediately after their capture. A 100-fold range of R2 transcript levels was detected and correlated with R2 retrotransposition activity. However, the number of R2 elements in the rDNA loci of the active and inactive lines did not substantially differ, suggesting the previously detected accumulation of R2 in active stocks was the result rather than the cause of R2 activity. The property of the rDNA locus that best correlated with R2 activity was subtle changes in the distribution of elements within the rDNA locus.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Our previous studies suggested that the levels of R2 transcription and retrotransposition in <italic>D. simulans</italic> are controlled by the composition of the rDNA locus located on the X chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

This 5&#x02032; end variation predominantly corresponds to truncations and has been suggested to arise from the R2 polymerase failing to reach the 5&#x02032; end of the R2 transcript during reverse transcription and/or from DNA repair processes associated with partial retrotransposition events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Under these conditions <italic>Not</italic>I fragments below 100 kb are not well separated from the buffer front moving through the gel. Thus those portions of the rDNA locus containing R2 elements separated by less than eight rDNA units (the average rDNA unit size is about 12 kb) are not present in the figure. These closely spaced R2-inserted units represent a small fraction of the rDNA locus (&#x0223c;25&#x00025;) but a large fraction of the R2 elements (&#x0223c;75&#x00025;).</p><p>The <italic>D. simulans</italic> lines with highest levels of R2 transcripts had on average smaller <italic>Not</italic>I fragments than the lines with low levels of R2 transcripts. This difference in size was significant, whether one used only the largest <italic>Not</italic>I fragment (&#x0223c;800 kb for the low lines and 540 kb for the high lines, Mann-Whitney U test, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.003), or the combined length of the three largest fragments in each line (&#x0223c;1850 kb for the low lines and 1200 kb for the high lines, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.004). This finding suggests that of the various properties of the rDNA locus that were measured, the distribution of R2 elements within the locus appeared to best serve as an indicator of whether R2-inserted units were transcribed. However, even this difference in the spacing of R2-inserted units is subtle in that changes in the location of only a small number of R2 elements within the locus could shift the profile from the low to high transcript patterns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The goal of this study was to apply what had been learned about R2 activity from our studies of laboratory stocks to characterize the pattern of R2 activity in natural populations of <italic>D. simulans</italic>. In our previous analyses nuclear run-on transcription experiments indicated that control over R2 element activity was at the level of transcription, while crosses between active and inactive lines revealed that this transcriptional control mapped to the site of all R2 insertions, the rDNA locus on the X chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in this study iso-rDNA locus lines were established from two natural populations and their levels of R2 transcripts determined within a few generations of isolation. In both populations, about one-half of the lines had levels of R2 transcripts that were very low to undetectable. In the remaining lines, the level of R2 transcript varied in a continuous manner over a wide range. In the 18 lines studied as representative of the R2 transcript range, a positive correlation was detected between R2 transcript level and R2 retrotransposition activity. While this correlation was not absolute, transcript level appeared to serve as a reliable indicator of potential R2 activity and thus a major means of control over R2 activity in a population. Structural analysis of the rDNA loci of the 18 lines indicated that the increased R2 transcription was not a result of the greater accumulation of R2 copies or changes in the size of the rDNA locus.</p><p>The property of the rDNA locus that best correlated with the level of R2 transcripts was the size of the largest continuous stretch of units free of R2 insertions. This suggestion that it is a difference in the distribution of R2 elements within the rDNA locus that controls R2 transcription adds considerable support to our previously proposed model of R2 regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. This model was based on several known properties concerning the transcription of rDNA units and their R2 insertions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. First, R2 elements do not appear to encode their own promoter; rather their RNA transcripts are processed from a co-transcript with the 28S rRNA gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Long1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush5">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, the size of the rDNA locus is sufficiently large that only a fraction of the rDNA units encoded by an organism are transcribed at any one time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Zhang1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Ye1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-McKnight1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, electron microscopic observations suggest that transcriptionally active rDNA units occur in contiguous blocks rather than as dispersed units throughout the locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Chooi1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Jamrich1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these observations we proposed that arthropods have evolved the ability to identify and actively transcribe one or more regions of the rDNA locus that contain the lowest frequency of R2-inserted units <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus significant transcription of R2 elements occurs when an organism is unable to identify large continuous regions of the rDNA locus free of insertions.</p><p>In the laboratory stocks used in our previous study, there was on average a two-fold greater number of R2 elements in active lines compared to the inactive lines. As a consequence it was not possible to exclude the model that the greater number of R2 insertions in the rDNA loci led to higher transcription levels. In our natural lines, on the other hand, the number of R2 insertions was similar between the active and inactive lines, suggesting that it is R2 distribution, not number, that determines whether R2-inserted units are transcribed. Our study also suggests that it may be the location of only a few R2 elements that determines the level of R2 activity within a line. A repositioning of only a small number of R2 elements could change the <italic>Not</italic>I digestion pattern of the low transcript lines to that of the high transcript lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000386-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In addition, our determination of transcript level was based on the level of full-length R2 transcripts, while the R2 distribution pattern was based on the presence of a <italic>Not</italic>I site near the middle of the R2 element. Thus the positioning of 5&#x02032; truncated R2 copies, that are of a length to retain the <italic>Not</italic>I site but not able to generate full-length transcripts, within the regions of lowest R2 abundance could explain why some lines low transcript lines (e.g. CS22) have <italic>Not</italic>I profiles more similar to a high transcript line.</p><p>Our analysis of the individual R2 elements present in the rDNA loci of each line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000386-g004">Figure 4</xref>) revealed that each rDNA locus had different collections of R2 insertions suggesting that R2 elements are continually being gained and lost within a population. The rDNA loci should, therefore, be viewed as a continuously changing landscape with the individual loci shifting between low and high levels of R2 transcription. These continuously changing rDNA loci can explain another difference between natural and laboratory stocks. Of the 15 lines isolated from Paradise, CA and maintained in the laboratory for about 10 years, about one-fourth (4 lines) had extremely high levels of R2 transcripts and retrotransposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Zhang2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. However, of the 180 lines established from the Atlanta and San Diego populations, only 2&#x00025; had transcript levels as high as that seen in the laboratory stocks, and only one of these lines had levels of retrotransposition as high as the laboratory stocks. While it is formerly possible that the Paradise population simply had higher levels of R2 activity, it appears more likely that during the prolonged period the Paradise stocks were maintained in the laboratory the inbreeding and relaxed selection conditions permitted the accumulation of the higher levels of R2 elements observed in these active laboratory stocks. Such shifts to high R2 element activity may also occur in the natural populations from Atlanta and San Diego, but such flies would be lost from the populations by natural selection. We have found that laboratory stocks with high levels of R2 activity are readily out-competed when crossed to laboratory stocks containing low levels of R2 activity (D. Eickbush, unpublished data).</p><p>One important feature of R2 control detected in our previous study of laboratory stocks was the dominance of expression of rDNA loci with low levels of R2 transcripts over loci with high levels of R2 transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In females containing one rDNA locus from a stock with high levels of R2 transcription (R2 active locus) and one locus from a stock with no R2 transcription (R2 inactive locus), rDNA units in the R2 inactive loci were preferentially transcribed. We termed this ability to turn off an entire rDNA locus nucleolar dominance, as it appeared similar to the frequent dominance of one rDNA locus in interspecies hybrids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Pikaard1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine if such dominance could also be detected between our natural rDNA loci, we conducted reciprocal crosses between the most active line in this study, CS24, to several inactive lines. In the heterozygous female offspring of both crosses the high level of R2 transcript seen from the CS24 loci was significantly turned off, consistent with the dominance of R2 inactive loci in natural populations (data not shown). However, such crosses involving lines with the more typical lower levels of transcripts were often not recessive to R2 inactive stocks. Thus, while more experiments are needed, nucleolar dominance may only influence loci with extremely high levels of transcripts.</p><p>Based on our survey of the two <italic>D. simulans</italic> populations we can estimate an R2 retrotransposition rate for the entire population. Comparing the rate of R2 retrotransposition with the level of transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000386-g005">Figure 5</xref>), about 50&#x00025; of the rDNA loci in the two populations are likely to undergo no retrotransposition. The remaining rDNA loci have a high probability of supporting some level of retrotransposition. For the 12 rDNA loci we sampled from this group, 46 retrotranspositions were detected when 16 chromosomes were monitored in the eighth generation giving a rate of 0.034 events/chromosome/generation &#x0005b;46 events / (12 lines &#x000d7;7 generations &#x000d7;16 chromosomes)&#x0005d;. As a lower limit, if we exclude the one extremely active line from this analysis the R2 retrotransposition rate drops to 0.019 events/chromosome/generation. Because only 5&#x02032; truncated R2 elements, which represent about half the total number of elements, were monitored in our assays, these rates should be multiplied by a factor of two (range of 0.038&#x02013;0.068). Finally, correcting for the fraction of the rDNA loci that have detectable levels of transcription (50&#x00025;) the total R2 retrotransposition rate for the population can be estimated at 0.019&#x02013;0.034 events/chromosome/generation. While this range is only a rough estimate, it is consistent with computer simulations conducted to mimic the types of recombination and rates of retrotransposition likely to be present in the rDNA loci of <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Zhang1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The findings in this report address one of the major questions concerning the ability of transposable elements to maintain themselves within a species lineage. Does the control mechanism of the cell occasionally breakdown, or is this mechanism simply incapable of preventing all new insertions? In the case of R2 our findings support the latter possibility. In most organisms, large numbers of R2 elements can be effectively prevented from transcription by expressing the rDNA units in only a small domain that does not contain R2 insertions. However, recombination events (in particular unequal crossovers) will expand, contract and rearrange the rDNA units in the locus meaning these domains free of R2 insertion are not permanently stable. Thus it is not a difference in the cellular control mechanism between animals in a population, but rather differences in their rDNA loci that determines whether R2 elements are being transcribed. The long-term stability of R2 elements is assured because even though all copies can be effectively silenced for long periods of time, the transcription of some copies will eventually be resurrected by recombination.</p><p>Of course transcriptional control may not be the only level at which the activity of R2 elements are regulated. While retrotranspositions have never been detected in a stock with no detectable R2 transcripts, there may not be a complete correlation between the level of R2 transcripts and the rate of retrotransposition. Retrotransposition events were difficult to detect in one of the lines with the highest level of R2 transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000386-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In one of our laboratory stocks, retrotransposition events were more frequent than expected based on R2 transcript levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus additional post-transcriptional steps appear to influence the rate of R2 retrotransposition in <italic>D. simulans</italic>. Further studies are needed to determine if these steps represents significant control mechanisms over R2 activity.</p><p>Finally, this population study not only provides additional support for a domain model of transcription in the rDNA locus but also addresses two evolutionary questions raised by our earlier studies. First, why do the different copies of R2 generated by retrotransposition usually remain single-copy (i.e. are not duplicated by recombination) until they are eventually lost from the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Zhang2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-PerezGonzalez2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Eickbush5">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>? Second, why in long-term studies of specific rDNA loci did the number of uninserted rDNA units change most rapidly than the inserted units <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000386-Averbeck1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>? Both of these finding can be explained if recombination events in the rDNA loci predominantly occur in the insertion free region of the rDNA locus activated for transcription. Thus an understanding of R2 location and control is needed to appreciate the forces at work in the expression and evolution of the entire rDNA locus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly Sources</title><p>Isofemale stocks of <italic>D. simulans</italic> collected in San Diego, CA were generated by Peter Andolfatto. <italic>D. simulans</italic> females of Atlanta population were collected by Todd Schlenke in Atlanta, GA.
