Seed germination, de-etiolation of aerial tissues, the architecture of the adult plant body and the production of organs involved in sexual or vegetative reproduction are controlled by light signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The degree of control depends on the species and the process. Studies in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>have revealed that large changes in transcriptome accompany the morphological and physiological shifts that occur during the de-etiolation process initiated when dark-grown seedlings are transferred to light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Large responses are also observed when young seedlings, briefly grown under white light, are exposed to supplementary far-red light that simulates the presence of neighbour vegetation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The apex of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>plants experiences modifications of the transcriptome induced by the exposure of seedlings grown under SD typical of winter to LD that induce flowering during warmer seasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These large light-induced changes in the transcriptome involve the action of plant photoreceptors at different levels, including the regulation of transcription and proteasome-mediated degradation of transcription factors, chromatin re-modeling and RNA interference (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]).</p><p>In addition to the studies conducted in the model eudicot <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, others have recently reported global transcriptional responses to light in monocot species. These studies are allowing us to understand species-specific light-regulated processes, such as photoperiodic effects on floret development in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. They are also being used for comparative purposes, as shown for the analysis of the transcriptional changes taking place during de-etiolation in rice and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Functional as well as evolutionary studies can also benefit from the comparison of transcriptional responses across closely-related species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The Solanaceae is an ideal family for comparative analysis of photomorphogenic and photoperiodic responses given that light regulates a variety of process in different species, such as tuberization in potato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], flowering in tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and germination in tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Potato cDNA microarrays have already been used to compare global expression profiles in mature leaves of six species of the Solanaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Here we compared transcriptional responses to contrasting light environments in the leaves of potato and tobacco plants, as well as in tomato seeds, with the aim of assessing the degree of conservation and divergence in the identity of genes regulated by light across species and developmental contexts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and experimental conditions</title><p>Plants of <italic>Solanum tuberosum </italic>spp. And&#x000ed;gena, which tuberize only under SD, were grown in growth chambers under non-inductive LD conditions. 55 and 41 days after sowing, half of the plants were transferred to inductive SD conditions for 1 or 15 days, respectively, whilst the rest of the plants were kept as controls under LD.

To investigate the generation of putative signals leading to tuberization, and unrelated transcriptional responses accompanying the acclimatization to a widely different light regime, we analyzed the transcriptome of potato plants transferred from LD to SD. Potato plants were grown in growth chambers under non-inductive LD conditions. After six weeks, half of the plants were transferred to inductive SD for 1 or 15 days, whilst the rest of the plants were kept under LD.

Therefore, 1 and 15 days SD were jointly compared to LD. From a total of approximately 10,000 cDNA clones present in the microarray, we found 274 (representing 261 different genes) down-regulated, and 167 (representing 155 different genes) up-regulated in SD compared to LD conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of photoperiod on gene expression in <italic>Solanum tuberosum </italic>spp. And&#x000ed;gena</bold>.

These findings are in agreement with a previous report indicating that three weeks after <italic>Solanum tuberosum </italic>spp. And&#x000ed;gena plants are transferred from LD to SD, chlorophyll and anthocyanin levels in the leaves of plants grown under SD conditions are 40 and 25% lower, respectively, than those from LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The expression of several genes involved in the metabolization of reactive oxygen species was also reduced under SD conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Genes encoding enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were differentially affected by photoperiod (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Within this group, those associated with starch and sucrose biosynthesis were down-regulated, and those involved in starch degradation were up-regulated, in plants grown under SD compared to LD conditions (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Genes associated with cell wall, biotic stress responses, hormone signalling, and aminoacid catabolism were up-regulated in SD compared to LD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Finally, the expression of many signaling components and transcription factors increased or decreased in response to changes in photoperiodic conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Some of these changes may be associated with the regulation of developmental processes such as tuberization (see below), whilst others may control more general metabolic and physiological adaptations to photoperiod. For instance, the expression of two genes encoding AMP-activated protein kinases was up-regulated under SD (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). AMP-activated kinases are known to turn-off energy dependent processes and mobilize energy reserves under low energy conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, its induction under SD conditions may contribute to optimize energy consumption during the autumn.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of phytochrome B-regulated gene expression in potato</title><p>PhyB is the main photoperiodic photoreceptor regulating tuberization in potato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Indeed, potato plants with reduced phyB levels obtained through antisense technology tuberize as well under LD as under SD, whilst wild-type plants only tuberize under SD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. To elucidate the genomic role of phyB in the perception of LD as well as in the control of genes unaffected by day-length, we compared the transcriptome of wild-type and antisense <italic>PHYB </italic>plants grown under LD conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We found 46 cDNA clones (representing 45 different genes) up-regulated and 28 cDNA clones (representing 27 different genes) down-regulated in WT plants compared to &#x003b1;-<italic>PHYB </italic>plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In contrast to what was observed for the group of genes regulated by photoperiod, no clear differential enrichment in functional categories was found for genes up-regulated compared to those down-regulated by phyB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Nonetheless, some of the individual changes in gene expression observed fit well with physiological alterations reported for plants with reduced phyB levels (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). For example, the expression of a senescence associated gene, which encodes an acyl-hydrolase that facilitates the process of membrane breakdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], was up-regulated in plants with reduced phyB levels and this is in agreement with the observation that leaf senescence is enhanced by low levels of active phytochromes in several species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, the expression of a gene encoding a pathogen related gene was down-regulated in &#x003b1;-<italic>PHYB </italic>compared to WT plants. Indeed, <italic>PR </italic>gene expression is affected in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>mutant plants lacking phyA and phyB, and these phytochrome mutants have reduced defense responses against pathogen attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of phyB on gene expression in <italic>Solanum tuberosum </italic>spp. And&#x000ed;gena</bold>.

These results indicate that although phyB is the main photoperiodic photoreceptor regulating the tuberization process, photoreceptors other than phyB play a significant role in the photoperiodic regulation of gene expression, probably associated with acclimatization responses to reduced light input rather than to the control of tuberization.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Comparative analysis of the effect of photoperiod and phyB on gene expression in potato</bold>.

For example, the expression of <italic>GIGANTEA </italic>was up-regulated under LD (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>), and this change is likely to contribute to the photoperiodic regulation of flowering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, a gene whose expression was down-regulated more than 4 fold after transferring the plants from non inductive LD to inductive SD encodes a CCAAT transcription factor (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). The gene with the highest degree of similarity in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>is <italic>At5g12840</italic>, which encodes a HAP2 protein that delays flowering when over-expressed in transgenic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Thus, down-regulation of the HAP2 homologue in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum </italic>MM could be involved in the promotion of flowering by SD in these plants. Finally the expression of a gene encoding an EIN3 homologue is up-regulated under SD (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). EIN3 homologues have been recently shown to promote the expression of several pathogen related proteins in tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus the enhanced expression of an EIN3 homologue may be causing the overrepresentation of biotic stress related genes in tobacco plants transferred to SD.</p><p>In spite of the significant overlapping in functional categories regulated by photoperiod in tobacco and potato, only 35% of the genes regulated by photoperiod in tobacco were significantly regulated by photoperiod in potato. In particular, many of the phenylpropanoid and biotic stress-associated genes regulated by photoperiod in tobacco were not affected in potato (or were affected to a significantly lesser extent) and the opposite occurs for many genes associated with the photosynthetic process and cell-wall modifying enzymes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Comparative analysis of the effect of photoperiod on gene expression between <italic>Nicotiana tabacum </italic>MM and <italic>Solanum tuberosum </italic>spp. And&#x000ed;gena</bold>.

Grafting experiments show that the substances that promote or inhibit flowering can be transferred among plants irrespective of their response type, indicating that the inhibitory or stimulatory substances are similar or identical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. To identify genes whose expression could be associated with the regulation of the floral transition, we compared the transcriptional changes that took place in the leaves of the <italic>Nicotiana </italic>biotypes described above, when the plants were transferred from non-inductive to inductive conditions. Using ANOVA we found 52 genes for which the photoperiodic regulation of expression was significantly different among biotypes and showed at least a two fold change in expression in one of them (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). The majority of these genes showed at least a two fold change in expression in either <italic>Nicotiana tabacum </italic>MM or <italic>Nicotiana sylvestris</italic>, but not in both species simultaneously, making uncertain whether they played a role in the contrasting photoperiodic regulation of flowering time among species. In contrast, four genes were up-regulated more than two fold under LD in <italic>Nicotiana tabacum </italic>MM (a SD plant) and under SD in <italic>Nicotiana sylvestris </italic>(a LD plant), suggesting that they might act as repressors of the floral transition in these plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). These genes encode a &#x003b2;-ZIP transcription factor, a serine acetyltransferase, and two proteins of unknown function. The expression of the &#x003b2;-ZIP transcription factor, as well as the expression of one unknown gene (cDNA STMGG84), was also regulated by photoperiod and phyB in potato (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), suggesting they may regulate the tuberization process.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Genes showing opposite responses to photoperiod in <italic>Nicotiana </italic>biotypes with contrasting photoperiodic regulation of flowering time</bold>.

For this we exposed tomato seeds to short pulses of red or far-red light for 3, 6 or 9 hours, extracted total RNA from whole seeds, and used the RNA to analyze gene expression with potato cDNA microarrays. Using this approach we could identify only 4 genes regulated more than 1.5 fold by light (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>). The reduced impact of light on gene expression in tomato seeds, compared to its larger effect in potato and tobacco leaves, could be due to the fact that regulation of germination in tomato most likely involves molecular changes taking place specifically in a few cells in the micropylar region of the endosperm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], but we used total RNA extracted from whole seeds for our analysis. In addition, it is likely that some of the genes involved in the regulation of seed germination are specifically expressed in seeds, and are not represented in the potato cDNA microarray. In spite of the limitations just described, some of the genes identified are likely to have a role in the promotion of germination by red light. One of the genes up-regulated in red compared to far-red light encodes a glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase, and increases in the protein levels of a similar protein have already been reported to occur in tobacco and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>seeds during germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The increase in expression of this glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase may play a role hydrolizing the cell walls of endosperm cells, thus facilitating radicle emergence. Interestingly, the other gene up-regulated by red compared to far-red light in tomato seeds encodes a homologue of <italic>GIGANTEA</italic>, which we found to be regulated by photoperiod and phyB in potato and by photoperiod in the leaves of tobacco plants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Regulation of <italic>GIGANTEA </italic>expression by red compared to far-red light in tomato seeds was confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), indicating that its control by light is indeed conserved across species and developmental contexts.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of R compared to FR on the expression of <italic>GIGANTEA </italic>in tomato seeds</bold>.

Furthermore, although it is well established that the perception of photoperiod takes place in the leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], no single study has analyzed so far the effect of photoperiod on gene expression levels in the leaves of any plant species.</p><p>In this study we have identified hundreds of genes whose expression differed between the leaves of plants grown under LD and SD conditions, when compared 14 hours after the beginning of the photoperiod (i.e. 2 hours before lights off in LD and 6 hours after lights off in SD). These differences in expression could result from direct effects of light on gene expression, and/or from interactions between light and the circadian clock (e.g. from effects of light on the amplitude and/or phase of circadian rhythms in gene expression). An evaluation of gene expression data spanning a complete day would be required to investigate the above options in more detail.</p><p>Many genes associated with the photosythetic apparatus and the synthesis of protective pigments were down-regulated under SD compared to LD conditions. Genes associated with redox metabolism were also down-regulated in SD compared to LD. All the above indicates that a major part of the transcriptional changes taking place during the transition from LD to SD is associated with a reduction in the synthesis of proteins that cooperate to convert solar into chemical energy, as well as in pigments and redox regulating enzymes needed to protect plants from the damaging effects of excess of radiant energy that plants receive under LD. These results are in agreement with a recent study conducted in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, showing that the endogenous system that measures day-length interacts strongly with redox regulatory mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The later study shows that plants grown under LD constitutively display systems for the prevention of oxidative damage and show no further responses to increases in radiant energy. On the other hand, plants grown under SD invest less resources in preventing oxidative damages when grown under low to moderate irradiances, but show strong increases in antioxidant mechanisms when exposed to high levels of radiant energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Another interesting observation from our microarray dataset was that genes associated with aminoacid catabolism were up-regulated under SD compared to LD in potato plants. Up-regulation of this gene class has already been reported to occur in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>in response to extended darkness and sugar starvation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our results suggest that an increase in aminoacid catabolism genes is a general acclimatization response that may help plants adjust carbon and energy metabolism in response to sugar starvation conditions associated with the shortening of the day. Candidate genes to mediate the regulation of the above changes are those encoding subunits of AMP-activated kinases, whose expression also increased under SD. Interestingly, it has been reported recently that a <italic>Physcomitrella patens </italic>mutant lacking two AMP-activated kinases only grows well under continuous light but is unable to grow under light-dark cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Therefore, changes in transcript levels of genes encoding AMP-activated kinases may play a significant signaling role adjusting the carbon and energy metabolism of plants to the low energy condition resulting from short photoperiods.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionary origins of the photoperiodic regulation of the transcriptome in the Solanaceae</title><p>The comparison of transcriptomic responses to changes in photoperiod in potato and tobacco offered an interesting opportunity to explore the evolutionary origins of light regulated responses in the Solanaceae. It is generally believed that similar phenotypes in closely related species are the consequence of conserved evolutionary processes. Indeed, several genes associated with redox homeostasis, sugar metabolism and the photosynthetic process were similarly regulated by photoperiod in potato and tobacco, suggesting an ancient evolutionary origin for the regulation of those metabolic and physiological processes. However, a common adaptive response to a similar environmental challenge can also arise through convergent evolutionary processes involving different molecular mechanisms. One of the most common responses of plants to the excess of light to which they are exposed during the LD of the summer is the accumulation of protective pigments derived from the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway. Here we show that several of the genes associated with the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway that were regulated by photoperiod differed between tobacco and potato plants. For example, the expression of a gene encoding a phenylalanine ammonia-lyase enzyme was strongly regulated by photoperiod in tobacco but not in potato. The converse occurred for a gene encoding a flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase enzyme (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that the molecular mechanisms leading to the accumulation of pigments that can protect plants from the excess of radiant energy during the summer might be the result, at least in part, of independent but convergent evolutionary processes in potato and tobacco. A similar phenomenon has been described in mice, where the evolution of the pigmentation phenotype in two closely related species appears to have a different genetic origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>GIGANTEA, a signaling component associated with multiple phytochrome-regulated developmental processes in the Solanaceae</title><p>The photoperiodic regulation of tuberization in potato is a well studied process at the physiological level, but the molecular mechanisms underlying it are only beginning to be understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. PhyB has been shown to inhibit tuberization under LD, promoting the synthesis of an inhibitor of the tuberization process, although the molecular nature of this inhibitor remains elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We found that, among the 416 different genes (represented in 441 cDNA clones) whose expression was regulated by photoperiod in potato leaves, 15 genes were also regulated by phyB. Among these we found <italic>GIGANTEA</italic>, a gene that promotes flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. <italic>GIGANTEA </italic>positively regulates the expression of <italic>CONSTANS</italic>, a transcriptional regulator that promotes floral induction when its protein accumulates above a threshold level. Indeed, over-expression of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana CONSTANS </italic>gene in potato plants delays tuberization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Since tuberization is induced under SD, the up-regulation of <italic>GIGANTEA </italic>under LD compared to SD is likely to repress the tuberization process, presumably through the regulation of <italic>CONSTANS </italic>expression.</p><p>Interestingly, we also found <italic>GIGANTEA </italic>as one of the genes whose expression was up-regulated by red light in tomato seeds. In agreement with this observation, we have observed that, at least in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>GIGANTEA </italic>mediates the promotion of germination triggered by light pulses perceived by phytochrome A[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The results presented here suggest that, at least in tomato, <italic>GIGANTEA </italic>may mediate the red-light promotion of germination that is expected to be controlled by phyB. <italic>GIGANTEA </italic>has already been shown to play a positive role in phyB mediated de-etiolation in <italic>Arabidospsis thaliana </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Furthermore, our results show that the expression of <italic>GIGANTEA </italic>is regulated by phyB in the leaves of potato plants. Thus, <italic>GIGANTEA </italic>is likely to play a key role mediating different phytochrome regulated processes in different species.</p></sec><sec><title>Identifying candidate photoperiodic regulatory genes through comparative functional genomics</title><p>Changes in photoperiod regulate flowering time in many species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Most of the genes that mediate the photoperiodic regulation of flowering have been identified during the last decade through forward genetic approaches using <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>and rice as model systems. The identification of photoperiodic regulated genes can also be a useful approach to find new flowering time genes. However, genes whose expression is regulated by photoperiod may not only act regulating developmental transitions, but also other unrelated physiologic and metabolic processes. One way of overcoming the above problem is comparing gene expression in plants with contrasting photoperiodic responses and identifying those genes whose expression correlates with the final response (promotion or repression of floral transition), rather than with the actual photoperiodic condition under which the plants are growing. An example of such gene is <italic>FT</italic>, whose mRNA increases in the leaves of the long-day <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>plants under LD conditions, whilst the mRNA of an <italic>FT </italic>orthologue increases under SD in the leaves of the short-day rice plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Another example is the <italic>FLOWERING PROMOTING FACTOR 1 </italic>gene from tobacco, whose overexpression accelerates flowering in <italic>Nicotiana </italic>species with contrasting photoperiodic response types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, the expression of this gene increases in the apices of the SD plant <italic>Nicotiana tabacum </italic>MM during growth under SD, as well as in the apices of the LD plant <italic>Nicotiana sylvestris</italic>, when the later is grown under LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>Here we compared global changes in gene expression in the SD plant <italic>Nicotiana tabacum </italic>MM and in the LD plant <italic>Nicotiana sylvestris</italic>, when the plants were moved from non-inductive to inductive conditions for the floral transition. This approach allowed us to identify four genes whose expression was anti-correlated with the floral induction process. One of the genes identified encodes a &#x003b2;-ZIP transcription factor. In <italic>Nicotiana tabacum </italic>MM, the expression of this gene was higher under LD compared to SD, and in <italic>Nicotiana sylvestris </italic>its expression was higher under SD compared to LD. Thus, this gene is likely to encode a repressor of the floral transition. In principle, a transcription factor repressing the floral transition could operate promoting the expression of a floral inhibitor or repressing that of a floral promoter. Transmission of flower-promoting materials through grafting experiments have been demonstrated for both <italic>Nicotiana tabacum </italic>MM and <italic>Nicotiana sylvestris</italic>, whilst transmition of flower-inhibiting substances have only been observed for <italic>Nicotiana sylvestris </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The latest observation suggests that the &#x003b2;-ZIP identified here might repress the expression of a floral-promoting factor in both <italic>Nicotiana </italic>species.</p><p>Physiological as well as molecular evidence indicates that the factors mediating the photoperiodic regulation of flowering and tuberization may be similar or identical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. If this were the case, some of the genes that we identified as candidates to regulate flowering time in <italic>Nicotiana </italic>species may also be candidates to control tuberization in potato. Interestingly, we found that the expression of the &#x003b2;-ZIP transcription factor decreased in the leaves of potato plants that were transferred from LD to SD and was also higher in WT plants compared to transgenic plants with reduced phyB levels. Thus this gene is a good candidate to act not only as a flowering time regulator but as general regulator of photoperiodic responses in the Solanaceae. Reverse genetic approaches are under way to evaluate the role of this &#x003b2;-ZIP transcription factor in the photoperiodic control of plant development.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of cDNA microarrays allowed us to identify hundreds of genes that were regulated by light in different species of the Solanaceae. Many genes were regulated by photoperiod in potato, and a few of those were also regulated by phyB (the main photoperiodic photoreceptor controlling tuberization), making them good candidates to act as developmental regulators. The comparison of photoperiodically regulated genes between potato and tobacco revealed conserved, but also species-specific responses, showing that adaptations to changes in the light environment have evolved multiple times and represent a mixture of ancient as well as recent evolutionary processes. Finally, we found a few genes regulated by light across developmental contexts and species. Some of these are homologues of genes previously found to play critical roles in light signaling in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>and rice, whilst others are proposed to play regulatory roles in light signaling for the first time in this work. Thus, the use of a comparative functional genomic approach appears to be a useful tool to enhance our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms underlying adaptation of plants to changes in the light environment, as well as to identify signaling regulators.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MJY and JJC developed the experimental design.
