Recent crystal structures of filaments formed by Rad51 and the closely related archeal RadA and eubacterial RecA proteins place the ATPase site at the protomeric interface. To test the relevance of this feature, we mutated conserved residues at this interface and examined their effects on key activities of Rad51: ssDNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis, DNA binding, polymerization on DNA substrates and catalysis of strand-exchange reactions. Our results show that the interface seen in the crystal structures is very important for nucleoprotein filament formation. H352 and R357 of yeast Rad51 are essential for assembling the catalytically competent form of the enzyme on DNA substrates and coordinating its activities. However, contrary to some previous suggestions, neither of these residues is critical for ATP hydrolysis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Rad51 is central to the homologous recombination pathway for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks. The main function of Rad51 is to align a broken DNA end with a homologous sequence on an intact sister chromatid or homologous chromosome. It does so by forming a filament that coats a single strand (formed by other enzymes that process the broken ends), then searching for homologous sequences in duplex DNA and catalyzing the exchange of the matching strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Yeast and human Rad51 proteins have been characterized extensively. <italic>In vitro</italic> they bind single- and double-stranded DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In the presence of ATP or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs they can catalyze strand-exchange reactions between homologous DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>). DNA binding as well as high salt concentrations stimulate the ATPase activity of Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). These properties parallel those of eubacterial RecA, which performs a similar biological role and shares a conserved core domain with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, some dissimilarities between the biochemical properties of RecA and Rad51 have been described: they include differences in the ATP hydrolysis rates, in the apparent cooperativity of binding to DNA, and, under certain conditions, the polarity of the strand-exchange reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>).</p><p>Electron microscopy studies established that the filaments formed by RecA and Rad51 on DNA are right-handed, helical structures with &#x0223c;6 protein protomers per turn and that the DNA is bound near the filaments axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>). The pitch of the filaments is remarkably heterogeneous. One factor influencing this heterogeneity is the nucleotide cofactor: filaments formed with nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (and thus most likely to represent the active state for homology searching and strand exchange) appear more elongated with a helical pitch ranging between 90 and 130 &#x000c5;, while others formed with ADP or without a nucleotide cofactor are more compressed with a pitch of 60&#x02013;80 &#x000c5;. Thus, the switch between the two forms is likely modulated in response to ATP binding and/or hydrolysis, but the details of this allosteric mechanism are not currently understood.</p><p>Notably, Rad51 and its homologs from other kingdoms share a structurally conserved ATPase core domain with many other oligomeric ATPases, including many helicases and the F<sub>1</sub> ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In many of these systems, residues from one protomer contact the ATP bound to its neighbor. Some such residues, usually arginines, actively participate in ATP hydrolysis and are often called &#x02018;arginine fingers&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Others act as &#x02018;sensors&#x02019; that couple nucleotide binding to changes in the relative orientation of domains or entire protomers. Recent crystal structures of homologous recombinases identified conserved residues that appeared likely to play similar roles.</p><p>Several crystal structures of RecA, Rad51 and their archeal homolog RadA have been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24">19&#x02013;24</xref>). Their overall architecture is conserved, with a common core domain, containing both the ATPase and DNA-binding activities, preceded by a polymerization motif. The latter is a single &#x003b2; strand that adds onto the central &#x003b2; sheet of another protomer's core domain. This &#x02018;trans&#x02019; &#x003b2; strand is followed by a flexible linker, giving significant structural flexibility to the overall polymer. Rad51 and RadA have an additional helix&#x02013;hairpin&#x02013;helix containing N-terminal domain not found in RecA that may serve as a transient docking spot for duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Instead, RecA has a small C-terminal domain that may interact with duplex DNA but differs in structure and may also be regulatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>Most RecA crystal structures were determined in the absence of DNA, and regardless of the nucleotide cofactor bound, correspond to the inactive or compressed form, with pitches between 72 and 83 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29 B30">27&#x02013;30</xref>). However, the structure of a RecA filament bound to DNA and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog has recently been reported, with an extended pitch of 94 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The major difference between the low- and high-pitch filaments is the relative orientation of the ATPase domains. In the compressed RecA forms, the ATPase site is largely exposed to solvent. In contrast, the ATPase site is buried within the interface between adjacent core domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) in the extended form. This interface agrees well with previous biochemical and EM data, and places a series of conserved residues from one protomer in close proximity to (or in direct contact with) the ATP bound to its neighbor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33 B34">31&#x02013;34</xref>).<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>A network of interactions conserved across three kingdoms.

A K<sup>+</sup> ion also binds this phosphate, as well as D302 and the carbonyl of H280. Although high K<sup>+</sup> is required for mvRadA activity, the conservation of this aspartate implies that similar ion-mediated interactions are probably important in eukarytoic Rad51 as well.

However, scRad51 and mvRadA formed filaments in the crystal with extended pitches, from 104&#x02013;130 &#x000c5;, regardless of the nucleotide cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Although the extended forms vary in detail, like in the case of RecA-DNA filament, the ATPase site is placed between the protomers and conserved residues at this interface contact the nucleotides cofactors; such residues are likely candidates for the roles of sensors or fingers similar to other ATPases.</p><p>Here we examine how mutation of some of the conserved interface residues in scRad51 affects the formation of nucleoprotein filaments, <italic>in vitro</italic> strand-exchange reactions and DNA-stimulated ATPase activity. We focused on H352 and R357, which are situated across from the P-loop in the extended filament structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These residues participate in a highly conserved network of interactions that connects the two adjacent protomers, the ATPase site, and the DNA. H352 is conserved in most Rad51 and RadA proteins, but replaced by F in eubacterial RecAs, whereas R357 is strictly conserved across family members in all three kingdoms. We also examined the behavior of scRad51 I345T, originally identified in a screen for gain-of-function mutations that bypass the <italic>in vivo</italic> requirement for the accessory factors Rad55 and Rad57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). This mutant was shown to bind DNA more avidly in the presence of ATP. I345 is located at the C-terminal end of loop 2, and its backbone also participates in the network shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. It is conserved as I in most eukaryotic and archeal family members but as T in RecAs.</p><p>Some structures have implied that H352 and R357 could play a direct role in catalyzing ATP hydrolysis, while others imply that they may be conserved for other reasons. In some structures of archaeal mvRadA with AMPPNP bound, H280, the equilvalent of H352, extends from one protomer into the neighbor's ATPase site, directly contacting the 3rd phosphate group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). However, this region appears quite flexible. In the scRad51 filament structure, H352 also interacts the neighboring protomer's ATPase site, but the contact details differ from those seen in mvRadA and between alternating protomer&#x02013;protomer interfaces within the same scRad51 crystal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In other structures, the helix bearing this histidine is unfolded: those of mvRadA filaments bound to ADP or in the presence of low [K<sup>+</sup>] and AMPPNP, and the core domain of human rad51 (which lacked the polymerization motif and thus did not form a filament) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). In the RecA case, the equivalent residue is a phenylalanine, and thus more likely to be involved in interprotomer communication than catalysis. In the presence of an ATP analog and DNA, but not in other structures, this residue also interacts with the neighboring protomer's ATPase site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Although most changes to this F destroy RecA function, one mutation, F217Y, greatly increases ATP-mediated cooperativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>In most structures, R357 (or its equivalent) forms an ion pair with another strictly conserved residue, E182, and packs against the helix that contains H352. However, in the mvRadA structures where that helix is unfolded, the arginine comes into close contact with the neighboring protomer's nucleotide cofactor, raising the possibility that it could act as a more traditional arginine finger.</p><p>We find that this interface is indeed functionally important in yeast Rad51. Several substitutions of H352 and R357 in scRad51 strongly affect the ability of the protein to form filaments on single and double-stranded DNA and impair the catalysis of strand-exchange reactions <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also find that R357M and I345T mutants show enhanced ATP hydrolysis in the absence of ssDNA, and altered responses of ssDNA binding to nucleotide cofactor. However, H352 and R357 are not critical catalytic components of the ATPase site. Our data indicate that they are more analogous to the sensors of other related ATPases than to arginine fingers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>ScRad51 was purified as described previously, with minor modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).

Control experiments determined that under identical solution conditions this 63 mer stimulated the ATPase activity of WT Rad51 similarly to longer ssDNA substrates such as poly(dT)<sub>96</sub> or PhiX174 (data not shown). As the formation and stability of Rad51 filaments on oligonucleotides can be influenced by pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), we performed both the ATPase and the DNA-binding assays at two pH values, 6.2 and 7.5. In the absence of DNA, WT Rad51 hydrolyzed ATP very slowly (&#x0223c;0.018 min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>).

However, in all cases, particularly at pH 7.5, the rate of ssDNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis was significantly lower than for WT protein. The sharp contrast between the behavior of the H352/R357 mutants and the K191R mutant argues that, unlike K191, H352 and R357 are not essential for ATP hydrolysis. Nevertheless, the impact of point substitutions of these highly conserved residues on the ssDNA stimulated ATPase activity is quite large, and was even larger in initial assays carried out at lower protein and DNA concentrations. We hypothesized that the decreased levels of stimulation are related to the deficiency of these mutants in forming filaments on ssDNA. Our DNA-binding studies described below support this interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a and b).</p><p>One of the variants, R357M, is unique in that upon DNA addition its hydrolytic activity is initially slightly stimulated, but subsequently becomes 0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn973/DC1">Figure S1</ext-link>). Under our reaction conditions the initial stimulation lasts for about 30 min and the calculated amount of ATP hydrolyzed during this time interval is substoichiometric with respect to the protein. We do not understand the molecular origins of this effect but suspect that it might be related to our finding (discussed below) that ATP inhibits ssDNA binding by R357M. It is not simply the result of exonuclease contamination, because control experiments showed no degradation of a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 48-nt ssDNA after a 5-h incubation in the presence of 28 &#x000b5;M Rad51 and 10 mM Mg<sup>++</sup> (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>ssDNA binding correlates with ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity</title><p>To examine if any correlation exists between the ssDNA stimulated ATPase activity and the efficiency of ssDNA binding, we performed DNA-binding assays under conditions virtually identical to those used in the ATPase assays.

Rad51-I345T bound ssDNA with higher affinity than WT [as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>)]; this was especially striking at low pH, where &#x0223c;9-fold less of the I345T mutant was required to achieve half maximal binding, and we were probably in a stoichiometric binding regime.</p><p>For each protein variant, we interpolated the DNA-binding curves at the protein concentration where the ATPase assays were performed and plotted the DNA-binding efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a). This highlights the correlation between the efficiency of ssDNA binding and the stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by ssDNA. The notable exception is P-loop mutant K191R which, although it binds DNA efficiently, cannot detectably hydrolyze ATP. By comparison point mutations in position R352 and R357 show measurable rates of hydrolysis that generally reflect their deficiency in ssDNA binding.</p></sec><sec><title>I345T and R357M substitutions alter the coupling between binding of ssDNA and nucleotide cofactor</title><p>Two variants, I345T and R357M, hydrolyzed ATP faster than the WT protein in the absence of DNA at pH 6.2.

Substitutions in these positions significantly impaired the ability of Rad51 to catalyze <italic>in vitro</italic> strand-exchange reactions. Our DNA binding, ATPase and SFM data indicate that the H352 and R357 mutants were deficient in their ability to undergo ATP-dependent polymerization on DNA&#x02014;a critical step for assembling the catalytically competent form of the enzyme. In the absence of DNA, Rad51 mutants H352A/Y/F and R357M/K hydrolyze ATP similarly or&#x02014;in some cases&#x02014;slightly better than the WT protein. This result indicates that (i) the observed functional deficiency of these variants is not caused by misfolding or nonspecific aggregation and (ii) neither H352 nor R357 is critical for hydrolysis <italic>per se.</italic> Under conditions where their DNA-binding handicap is at least partially overcome (e.g. high concentrations), the mutant proteins can, indeed, hydrolyze ATP in a DNA-dependent manner. Notably, ATP binding and not hydrolysis is critical for function of homologous recombinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47 B48 B49">47&#x02013;49</xref>). Like some other AAA+ superfamily members, Rad51 may use ATP to control a conformational switch, becoming activated by cofactor binding and resetting upon hydrolysis and ADP + P<sub>i</sub> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Although our data show that H352 and R357 are not analogous to the <italic>trans</italic>-acting catalytic arginine fingers often found in NTPases, they are good candidates for <italic>trans</italic>-acting sensors of ATP presence. Recent work suggests that D374 of scRad51, conserved as K in RecAs and D in Rad51/RadA proteins, may aid catalysis in <italic>trans</italic>: a cation bound by the equivalent D302 of RadA interacts with the ATP's 3rd phosphate, as does the lysine of RecA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>d and e) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). However, this residue's main role may also be in sensing the presence of ATP (and thus properly organizing the interface) rather than in directly catalyzing its hydrolysis.</p><p>The similar behavior of the H352 and R357 mutants indicates that they probably disrupt the same cooperative pathway of interactions required for the ATP-dependent assembly of active Rad51-DNA filaments. H352 is ideally located to promote communication between filament subunits: it protrudes from an &#x003b1; helix and can dock into the neighboring protomer's ATPase site. The two structures most likely to reflect the active state for homology searching and ATPase activity are those of RecA with ADP AlF<sub>4</sub>, and mvRadA with AMPPNP and high K<sup>+</sup> (which activates this archaeal enzyme's activity). In both these cases, this conserved H/F stacks against the side chain of an invariant glutamine (326 of scRad51; 194 of RecA). This glutamine, which has long been proposed to be involved in ATP&#x02013;DNA crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>), appears to position an invariant glutamate, which in turn positions the attacking water molecule in the ATPase site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The helix bearing this conserved H/F structurally links the 3rd phosphate of the ATP analog to the DNA-binding end of loop 2. At the N-terminus of the helix, the DNA's phosphate backbone contacts the backbone NH groups of two highly conserved glycines, while at the C-terminal end, the carbonyl of the H/F interacts with a positive charge that bridges it to the cofactor's 3rd phosphate: the tip of K248 in RecA and a K<sup>+</sup> ion bound to D302 in RadA. These highly conserved charged interactions may also stabilize the helix by interacting with its dipole moment. Since this helix is unfolded and/or poorly ordered in several archaeal structures that do not include all the cofactors and/or form high-pitch right-handed filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>), its dynamics may play an important regulatory role. R357 lies on a &#x003b2; strand that packs against the H352-bearing helix. In the mvRadA filament in the presence of ADP or AMPPNP but the absence of the high K<sup>+</sup> required to activate this particular enzyme, the unfolding of this helix allows R357, normally occluded by the helix, to make a water-mediated contact with ATP bound to the neighboring protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The conformational metastability of this protein segment may be important in propagating changes associated with ligand and cofactor binding.<fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Coupling of the intersubunit interface to the ATPase site. In each panel, only one helix from the green protomer is shown, with the backbone drawn as a thin tube, for clarity.

Mutagenesis studies suggested that F217 and R222 of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecA (analogous to scRad51 H352 and R357, respectively) are involved in propagating ATP-mediated allosteric transitions between protein subunits in the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33">31&#x02013;33</xref>). Our data suggest that the Rad51 and RadA proteins posses a similar &#x02018;signature motif&#x02019; in this region with a similar role in filament formation and activation.</p><p>Some of our results with the I345T scRad51 variant were quite unexpected. We initially employed I345T as a positive control, since it had been previously characterized <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our data agreed that it has increased affinity for DNA and elevated ATPase rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In addition, the SFM images showed that it coats dsDNA substrates better than the WT protein. Since the I345T substitution is in DNA binding loop 2, a simple explanation for these results would be that it increases Rad51's affinity for all DNA. However, this hypothesis cannot explain the fact that at pH 6.2 the I345T mutant displays an increased ATP hydrolysis rate in the absence of DNA as well as an absolute requirement for the ATP cofactor in DNA binding&#x02014;two new results reported here. I345T's absolute requirement for ATP in DNA binding at low pH was quite unexpected. WT Rad51 is known to bind ss- and dsDNA in the absence of ATP, although the ATP-independent binding mode is unlikely to be physiologically relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, however, the two binding modes are not interconvertible and indirect evidence suggests that they are mechanistically different. I345T should be useful for addressing the differences between these two binding modes in future studies.</p><p>The I345T mutant is more sensitive than WT to the presence of cofactor, and in this sense, more RecA-like. Exactly why, however, is not immediately clear from the available static crystal structures. In RecA, this residue is conserved as T in the WT protein, and it does not contact the DNA at all. However, it lies within the critical loop 2, and the two glycines immediately following it bind the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The backbone carbonyl and nitrogen of this T are hydrogen bonded to the strictly conserved N193, which immediately precedes the allosteric affector Q194. In mvRadA, the equivalent residue is I273, and even in the absence of DNA it makes similar interactions. Loop 2 is in a similar, although not identical conformation, to that seen in RecA when bound to DNA. It may be that isoleucine in this position stabilizes a conformation of loop 2 that is competent, but suboptimal for DNA binding. This might explain why WT Rad51 is less dependent on ATP for DNA binding than the I345T mutant. Threonine at this postion may enhance DNA binding in the presence of ATP because when the suboptimal conformation is no longer stabilized, ATP binding can more easily drive a conformational change to the optimal configuration.</p><p>In sum, these data establish the functional significance of the intermolecular interface seen in the scRad51 and the RadA crystal structures. The conserved residues chosen for mutation (H352, R357 and I345) are not critical for catalysis of ATP hydrolysis but rather play important roles in coordinating cofactor binding to functionally important conformational changes.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn973/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> (<award-id>GM058827</award-id> to P.A.R.); Susan G.
