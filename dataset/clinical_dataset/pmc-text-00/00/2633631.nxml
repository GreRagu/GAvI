The aim of this study was to explore associations between NSAID use and mortality in patients with inflammatory polyarthritis (IP).</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and methods:</title><p>A total of 923 patients with new onset (IP), recruited to the UK Norfolk Arthritis Register (NOAR) between 1990&#x02013;1994, were followed up to the end of 2004. Current medication was recorded annually for the first 6 years and then every 2&#x02013;3 years. Rheumatoid factor (RF) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Logistic regression was used to calculate all cause and CVD mortality odds ratios (OR) for NSAID use at baseline and during follow-up, adjusting for gender and time-varying covariates: RF, CRP, joint counts, smoking, steroid use, DMARD use and other medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By 2004 there were 203 deaths, 85 due to CVD. At baseline, NSAIDs were used by 66% of patients. In final multivariate models, baseline NSAID use was inversely associated with all cause mortality (adjusted OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.84) and CVD mortality (adjusted OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86). Interval NSAID use had weaker mortality associations: all cause mortality (adjusted OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.00), CVD mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.66, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>No excess CVD or all cause mortality was observed in NSAID users in this cohort of patients with IP. This is at variance with the literature relating to NSAID use in the general population. It is unclear whether this represents unmeasured confounders influencing a doctor&#x02019;s decision to avoid NSAIDs in the treatment of IP.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experience increased rates of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) when compared to the general population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> The reasons for this increased CVD mortality and morbidity in association with chronic inflammatory joint disease is currently the subject of much research.

Given that patterns of NSAID use may be different in this patient group than in the general population, the aim of this study was to explore whether NSAID use was associated with cardiovascular mortality in patients who have IP.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>This study utilised data from the Norfolk Arthritis Register (NOAR).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> This is a primary care based inception cohort of patients who presented with signs and symptoms of IP. Patients with synovitis affecting two or more peripheral joints, lasting for &#x02a7e;4 weeks are eligible for assessment. Patients are visited in the home setting by a research nurse who conducts a structured interview, recording prescribed medications and patient use of over the counter (OTC) drugs. This medication history was used to estimate comorbidity with the number and types of medication used to quantify comorbid disease burden. Smoking status is recorded at each assessment and recorded as current, ex-smoker, or never smoker.</p><p>A joint examination is conducted and a blood sample is obtained for measurement of rheumatoid factor (RF) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration. Patients complete a modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) at each assessment. Subjects with definite inflammatory synovitis, who are not subsequently diagnosed by a consultant rheumatologist to have another condition, apart from rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, postviral arthritis and undifferentiated inflammatory polyarthritis, are eligible for inclusion on the register and are followed longitudinally. Subsequent assessments occur annually for the first 5 years of the study. After this, assessments occur every 2 years.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>NSAID exposure</title><p>NSAID use at the start of each interval of follow-up was determined from the current medication history obtained by the research nurse during each assessment. NSAID use prior to the baseline assessment was not recorded. NSAID exposure included OTC NSAIDs as well as doctor-prescribed NSAIDs. However, dosages, frequency and dates of starting and stopping NSAIDs were not recorded. Baseline NSAID use, ever reporting NSAID use in the study and time-varying NSAID exposure during the follow-up assessments were recorded. We did not record whether patients had been exposed to NSAIDs in the interim months between assessments.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>All patients included on the register were flagged on the UK National Health Service Central Register. Death notification and death certificates were provided for study participants who died in the UK. The underlying cause of death was grouped according to the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> Death was attributed to CVD if the main cause of death was issued with ICD9 codes 393&#x02013;459.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Analysis</title><p>Relationships between NSAID use and all cause and CVD mortality were explored using logistic regression. Mortality outcomes were explored in baseline NSAID users compared to non-NSAID users at baseline. Patients who were identified as never having used NSAIDs throughout the period of the study were compared to those patients who were identified as NSAID users at any NOAR assessments. Initially univariate analyses were undertaken. Subsequent analyses were undertaken by pooling data across all subjects and then adjusting for age and gender. Multivariate analyses were undertaken to determine the independent effect of NSAID use on all cause and cardiovascular mortality. The models were adjusted for gender, age and time-varying covariates recorded at the study assessments, including smoking status, CRP tertiles, RF, rheumatoid nodules, joint counts, morning stiffness, disability (HAQ), corticosteroids, DMARDs, number of comorbid medications used and use of medication to treat CVD. In addition NSAID use was treated as a time-varying exposure and the relationship between NSAID use and mortality was explored for each interval of follow-up. This was performed univariately and multivariately adjusting for time-varying covariates including disease variables, medication and smoking status. The analyses were repeated for the subgroup of patients who cumulatively met 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for RA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 923 subjects recruited to NOAR between 1990 and 1994 were eligible for study. Complete mortality follow-up was obtained for the cohort up to the end of December 2003. The median follow-up period was 10.7 years (interquartile range (IQR) 9.4 to 12.2).</p><p>At the baseline assessment 613 (66.4%) patients were NSAID users and a further 141 (15.3%) patients were identified as using NSAIDS during the follow-up assessments. Of these 754 ever NSAID users, NSAID use was reported at the start of 58% of follow-up intervals. A total of 169 (18.3%) patients reported no NSAID exposure at any of the study assessments. The mean duration of NSAID exposure during the period of this study, estimated from the number of study assessments where NSAID use was reported, was 4 years.</p><p>Baseline demographic and clinical disease characteristics of the cohort stratified by baseline NSAID use are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ard-68-03-0367-t01">table 1</xref>. The median age at disease onset was 55 years in NSAID users and non-users, and the proportion of female patients was similar in both groups. Approximately two-thirds of the subjects were or had been smokers. Comorbid illness, determined by current drug use, was remarkably similar between NSAID users and non-users with approximately 1 in 10 taking a cardiovascular drug at disease entry. Patients who were using NSAIDs had markers of more severe inflammatory joint disease at baseline. NSAID users were more likely to be RF positive, have rheumatoid nodules and a higher HAQ score at baseline. They also had higher CRP concentrations and had clinical evidence of more active inflammatory joint disease with higher swollen and tender joint counts, and more prolonged morning stiffness than non-NSAID users. DMARD use at baseline was low and similar in both groups. At baseline 41% of the cohort met ACR classification criteria for RA. This rose to 67% when the criteria were applied cumulatively throughout the study.</p><table-wrap id="ard-68-03-0367-t01" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Baseline variables by

Patients who were exposed to NSAIDs tended to have a reduced risk of dying than the study patients who did not receive NSAIDs. This relationship was particularly strong for cardiovascular mortality and, ever being exposed to NSAIDs was associated with a 2.5-fold reduction in risk of cardiovascular death. However, increasing duration of NSAID exposure was not found to be associated with greater reductions in CVD mortality.</p><p>These findings are somewhat surprising given the results from other studies. Several clinical trials have demonstrated a higher risk of adverse CVD outcomes for patients treated with selective COX2 inhibitors compared to placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> In addition, epidemiological studies have raised concerns over the cardiovascular safety of non-selective NSAIDs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> These studies examined cardiovascular outcomes in large population based groups. There is little data reported on NSAID associations with cardiovascular events within cohorts of patients with chronic inflammatory disease. A small cardioprotective effect has been observed in some studies with use of naproxen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and ibuprofen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> A recent meta-analysis of nine randomised controlled trials in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis found that use of non-selective NSAIDs, compared to placebo, had a combined odds ratio for CVD events of 0.6 (95% CI 0.2 to 1.7).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> Naproxen use was associated with similar risk of CVD events to that observed with other non-selective NSAIDs. The number of events reported by these studies was low and the authors conclude that use of NSAIDs had no significant effect on cardiovascular events in patients with joint disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> Therefore our finding of reduced risk of CVD mortality in patients with inflammatory arthritis using NSAIDs warrants further discussion.</p><p>Inflammation is a strong predictor of future CVD mortality in early IP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and in RA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> In this study markers of inflammation, including joint counts and baseline CRP, were higher in patients who used NSAIDs. However, there were no significant interactions between NSAID use and baseline CRP concentration in the multivariate regression models.</p><p>We know that inflammation is associated with modification of eicosanoids with increased generation of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin. COX1 derived thromboxane A2 promotes platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction while COX2 driven endothelial prostacyclin production reduces the effects of thromboxane A2 by triggering vasodilatation and inhibiting platelet aggregation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> Atherosclerotic lesions are rich in cells that express the COX2 enzyme that may be implicated in atherosclerotic plaque destabilisation and the development of CVD events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> It is possible that the use of NSAIDs in patients with chronic inflammation influences the eicosanoid pathway to produce a net beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system. In our study we failed to show any further CVD benefit from increasing duration of NSAID exposure. This suggests that NSAID-induced eiconanoid modification was unlikely to be responsible for the favourable CVD mortality outcome. A limitation of this study was that NSAID exposure was not accurately measured as dosage and actual time on each treatment were not recorded. Therefore it is difficult to interpret whether increased NSAID exposure actually influences CVD mortality.</p><p>In clinical trials it has been demonstrated that regular use of high-dose naproxen induces suppression of platelet thromboxane similar to that seen with low-dose aspirin,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> and this lends plausibility to a cardioprotective effect of this drug. Other non-selective NSAIDs may have similar antiplatelet effects to aspirin.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> However, population based observational studies have failed to show cardioprotective effects of these drugs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> NSAIDs tend to be used regularly in the treatment of symptoms of inflammatory arthritis. However, dosage and frequency of NSAIDs were not recorded in this study and many patients changed NSAIDs during follow-up. Naproxen was used in only 17% of NSAID exposures identified and it seems unlikely that the cardioprotective association observed in this study was due to an effect of naproxen alone. The most frequently used NSAID during the period of this study was diclofenac, which has been shown in other studies to have a CVD risk similar to that seen with selective COX2 inhibitors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref></p><p>A major limitation of this study was the potential inaccuracy in assigning NSAID exposure. It is highly likely that several patients, categorised as &#x0201c;never&#x0201d; exposed to NSAIDs during this study, will have used NSAIDs either prior to their baseline assessment or during the interim period between their assessments. In the UK, patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis are often encouraged to use NSAIDs for symptom control. It is likely that frequent users of NSAIDs will include NSAIDs in their current medication that is recorded by the nurses conducting the home-based interviews. Therefore, although NSAID exposures were not recorded accurately in this observational study, the finding of higher death rates in patients with IP who do not frequently use NSAIDs is an important study finding that contributes to the research literature in this area. This should prompt further study examining NSAID associations with CVD outcomes in inflammatory arthritis.</p><p>Another possible explanation for our findings includes the effects of unmeasured confounders. This longitudinal study has enabled examination of the effects of NSAID exposure on mortality with adjustment for variables measuring the severity of the inflammatory joint disease, inflammation, smoking and comorbidity. However, unmeasured factors may have influenced the decision to use an NSAID and the risk of mortality. The sensitivity analysis revealed that a single unmeasured confounder would have to be very strongly associated with NSAID use and mortality. It is possible that multiple unmeasured confounders may act together to produce this size of effect. Patient characteristics that are difficult to quantify, for example frailty, may have led to avoidance of NSAID use in these patients. In this situation NSAID use might indicate more healthy participants who have better CVD survival.</p><p>Doctor prescribing habits are difficult to determine. At the time of this study there was little evidence to suggest that NSAIDs should be avoided in patients at high risk of CVD. Therefore, it is unlikely that doctors systematically avoided NSAID prescriptions for patients with increased CVD risk. Another limitation of this study was that comorbidity was not recorded. However, CVD medication, antiplatelet medication and cholesterol lowering medication were recorded at the baseline and annual assessments and this provided a proxy measure for CVD comorbidity. In the propensity model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ard-68-03-0367-t05">table 5</xref>), CVD medication use was identified as having an inverse association with NSAID use. This might support doctor-channeling of NSAIDs away from frail patients with CVD thereby explaining this paradoxical relationship between NSAID use and reduced CVD mortality outcome. However, the multivariate analysis revealed that the NSAID mortality association persisted even after adjusting for CVD medication use.</p><p>Therefore the finding of reduced CVD mortality in patients with IP treated with NSAIDs is interesting but difficult to explain. It may represent channeling of NSAIDs away from vulnerable patients rather than a true cardioprotective effect of the NSAID drug. However, this study suggests that the increased CVD risk observed in patients with IP is unlikely to be due to the effects of NSAIDs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
