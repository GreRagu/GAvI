The major angiogenic factor involved is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).

VEGF-A secretion was elevated by BayK8644 (10 &#x003bc;M) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 10 ng/ml), both of which are able to activate L-type channels. Cells from CNV tissue also showed nifedipine-sensitive Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents, which displayed a voltage-dependent activation at more negative potentials, faster inactivation and changed regulation by tyrosine kinase pp60<sup>c-src</sup>. The CNV RPE cells showed higher VEGF secretion rates which were reduced by nifedipine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Thus, L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in normal RPE cells regulate the secretion of VEGF.

A changed growth factor secretion by the RPE is believed to be involved in the etiology of proliferative eye diseases,such as choroidal neovascularization (CNV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>] in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the most common cause for legal blindness in industrialized countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Mainly a changed growth factor secretion by the RPE seems to be of importance for initiating CNV: increased secretion of pro-angiogenic factors and decreased secretion of anti-angiogenic factors. CNV, representing the most severe complication in AMD, originates in choroidal blood vessels that grow through Bruch's membrane into the sub RPE as well as the subretinal space. In many studies, but especially in recent clinical trials, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appears to be the major angiogenic factor in this process.</p><p>Several studies using cultured or freshly isolated RPE cells from various species demonstrated the expression of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels represent a group of high-voltage activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Studies examining the regulation of L-type channels of the RPE suggested that these Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels provide a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx pathway involved in growth factor-dependent intracellular signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Activation of L-type channels in the RPE by the cytosolic subtype tyrosine kinase pp60<sup>c-src</sup> shifts the voltage-dependent activation to a more negative voltage-range, closer to the resting potential of RPE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. This leads to a higher number of active channels and, thus, an increase in intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In this way, high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels can contribute to intracellular signaling in epithelial cells. A voltage-dependent activation in a rather negative voltage-range has been discussed as a property of L-type channels composed of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 &#x003b1;-subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. The expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 subunits has been demonstrated in rat RPE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Thus, L-type channels in RPE cells can participate in intracellular signaling which could mediate changes in a yet unknown RPE cell function.</p><p>L-type channels composed of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 &#x003b1;-channel-subunit belong to the neuroendocrine subtype, because these channels are known to regulate the insulin secretion by &#x003b2;-islet cells in the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. The RPE is known to secrete a variety of growth factors like insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF2), VEGF or pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. In order to show that L-type channels might regulate secretion rates in RPE cells we studied voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and the regulation of VEGF-A secretion by human RPE cells and by RPE cells from surgically excised CNV tissues of AMD patients. We found that VEGF secretion is dependent on the activity of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which might provide new targets to prevent CNV by interventions at the source for VEGF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Human tissue</title><p>For the use of human material, tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki were followed, informed consent was obtained, and Institutional Human Experimentation Committee approval was granted for the studies.

Cells from donor eyes without CNV were placed into single-cell suspension by the same method. Cell suspensions were placed onto a poly-lysine-coated glass cover slip and allowed to settle. The cover slips were placed into the perfusion chamber on the stage of an inverted microscope and constantly superfused.

The following procedure was used for freshly isolated cells. After the perforated-patch recording of a pigmented cell the patch was opened into a classical whole-cell configuration, and negative voltage was applied to facilitate diffusion of the antibody from the pipette into the cell. The patch-pipette was removed from the cell, and the cell stayed attached to the ground and could be subjected to immuno-staining. In the first step, the cells underwent methanol-based fixation followed by permeabilization with Triton X-100 (0.5% in PBS). Then cells were washed several times and incubated with the secondary fluorescence conjugated antibody. Cultured cells underwent methanol-based fixation and permeabilization before they were incubated with the first antibody for 1 h. After being placed through a series of washes cells were next incubated with the secondary fluorescence conjugated antibody.

Under these conditions, we found that VEGF concentration increased with time in the test medium in both RPE cells from eyes without CNV and in RPE cells from CNV membranes. However, the VEGF concentration increased significantly faster and reached higher concentrations in cultures containing cells from CNV membranes when compared to cultures of cells from eyes without CNV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). This resulted in a higher VEGF secretion rate of 12.8 &#x000b1; 1.4 pg/h (versus no CNV: 5.4&#x000b1;0.9 pg/h; n=4; p=0.0475). Inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels by nifedipine (10<sup>-5</sup> M) reduced VEGF secretion by both cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). To confirm the conclusion that activation of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels leads to secretion of VEGF, we used the L-type channel Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel modulator BayK8644 (10<sup>-5</sup> M; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B,C</xref>) as (-) enantiomer, which activates L-type channels and as the (+) enantiomer, which inhibits L-type channels. The (-) BayK8644 increased the VEGF secretion rate by RPE cells from eyes without CNV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>), whereas it only slightly increased the VEGF-A secretion rate in cells from CNV membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Intracellular application of the cytosolic subtype of tyrosine kinase pp60<sup>c-src</sup> (30 U/ml) during the whole-cell configuration via the patch-pipette increased the maximal current amplitude of L-type channels in RPE (n=4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>). Application of heat-inactivated pp60<sup>c-src</sup> did not change the L-type channel activity (n=4). Furthermore, intracellular application of pp60<sup>c-src</sup> accelerated time-dependent inactivation of L-type channel currents (reduction of inactivation time constant to 22&#x000b1;11% of control measured directly after breaking into the whole-cell configuration; n=7; p=0.00036 paired test) Thus, pp60<sup>c-src</sup> subtype of tyrosine kinase is an activator of L-type channel activity and modulator of L-type channel kinetics in human RPE cells. Intracellular application of the active pp60<sup>c-src</sup> to RPE cells from CNV membranes did not increase the maximal current amplitude (n=3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7B</xref>) or change the time-dependent inactivation (inactivation time constant 67&#x000b1;21% of control; n=4; not significant with paired test).

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus, L-type channels in cells from CNV membranes are activated by src-subtype tyrosine kinase, but these channels cannot be further stimulated by pp60<sup>c-src</sup>. However, as we demonstrated bFGF can further stimulate L-type channel activity in cells from CNV membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The RPE is known to secrete a variety of growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. In this study, we provide insight into the mechanisms that regulate their secretion rate. We found the rate of VEGF secretion by human RPE cells is dependent on the activation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Furthermore, RPE cells from CNV tissue also maintained expression of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and secreted the angiogenic factor VEGF in response to activation of these channels. Our observations might be of importance to explore new strategies to prevent or reduce CNV.</p><p>Freshly isolated human RPE cells showed dihydropyridine-sensitive voltage-dependent Ba<sup>2+</sup> inward currents in response to depolarization to potentials more positive than -30 mV from a holding potential of -70 mV. Thus, fresh human RPE cells exhibited currents with properties of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. We used a mixture of charge carrier ions of 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 10 mM Ba<sup>2+</sup> to enhance seal formation and stability of the perforated-patch configuration. This would lead to an anomalous mole fraction effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. This effect arises from the higher affinity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> compared to Ba<sup>2+</sup> at the selectivity filter of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel pore and leads to changes in the current properties such as smaller amplitudes or even occasional shifts in the voltage-dependence of the currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. However, the presence of L-type channels is in accordance with many studies using freshly isolated or cultured RPE cells from various species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. The L-type channel currents in freshly isolated human RPE cells exhibited fast time-dependent activation, rather negative potential of half-maximal activation, and were reduced to only 40% of the control values in the presence of 10<sup>-5</sup> M nifedipine, a rather large concentration. With the low dihydropyridine sensitivity, voltage-dependence, and kinetic behavior, the currents in freshly isolated human RPE cells share characteristics with currents exhibited by L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel &#x003b1;-subunit Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 investigated in a heterologous expression system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. The dihydropyridine block was incomplete in which the currents differ from those in heterologous expression system. However, characterization of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 channels in native cells revealed that these channels were also only incompletely blocked by dihydropyridines at large concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. Thus, the currents in freshly isolated RPE cells from eyes without CNV display characteristics of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 channels by means of voltage-dependence, dihydropyridine sensitivity, and activation kinetics. The application of nifedipine did not change the voltage-dependent activation of the channels. Thus, the L-type channel blocker did not unmask another Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel with a different voltage-dependence contributing to the whole-cell Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents. The expression of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 subunit was confirmed by Western blot analysis of membrane proteins. The predominant expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 subunits in the RPE was also described in rat and mouse cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. However, the L-type channel currents in human RPE cells showed a fast inactivation with a time constant of 50 ms. Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 subunits in a heterologous expression system showed almost no inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>] except in one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. The reason for this difference remains to be elucidated. It might be due to the absence of an anomalous mole fraction effect in other studies that did not use extracellular solutions containing both Ba<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, to different phosphorylation in native cells, or different composition of accessory subunits. Another possibility might be the specific splice variant expressed in RPE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. This splice variant has not been so far described to be present in other tissues, and its characteristics are unknown.</p><p>The western blot analysis analysis also revealed a weak expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 (channel &#x003b1;1C) subunits. The time- and voltage-dependent activation indicates that this subtype of L-type channel might only weakly contribute to the whole-cell Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents in RPE cells, but it cannot be excluded.</p><p>The expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (or &#x003b1;1D subunits) known as neuroendocrine L-type channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>] in RPE cells implies a role in the control of the secretory activity. Since expression of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels was maintained in cultured cells, we analyzed effects of L-type channel modulation on VEGF secretion by RPE cells in vitro. Direct modulation of L-type channels by application of the dihydropyridine compound BayK8644 substantially changed the VEGF secretion rate. Application of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activating enantiomer of BayK8644 increased the VEGF secretion rate. The same was observed by stimulation with low concentration of fetal calf serum. Furthermore, application of bFGF stimulated both L-type channel currents and VEGF secretion rate. The growth-factor-stimulated increase in VEGF secretion was reduced by L-type channel inhibition using nifedipine or the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocking enantiomer of BayK8644. Thus, either direct or growth-factor-dependent stimulation of L-type channels resulted in an increase of the VEGF secretion rate. The underlying growth-factor-dependent increase in L-type channel activity might be achieved in two ways. First, the bFGF receptor FGFR-2 can stimulate L-type channels by direct interaction with the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Second, the Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 subunit in rat RPE was found to directly interact with the cytosolic tyrosine kinase pp60<sup>c-src</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. In human cells pp60<sup>c-src</sup> inhibition results in a decrease of L-type channel activity, whereas intracellular application of pp60<sup>c-src</sup> leads to an increase of L-type channel activity. Thus, pp60<sup>c-src</sup> constitutively maintains a basic level of L-type channel activity, which can be further increased. Since stimulation by several growth factors results in an increase of pp60<sup>c-src</sup> activity, the growth-factor-dependent stimulation of VEGF secretion might result from pp60<sup>c-src</sup>-dependent activation of L-type channels.</p><p>Patch-clamp recordings with freshly isolated cells from CNV revealed that RPE cells can maintain the expression of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in disease. In a number of investigated membranes, none of the RPE cells displayed any voltage-dependent current. These cells showed a linear current/voltage relationship with maximal current amplitudes in the range of +/- 20 pA. This corresponds with observations in histological investigations of CNV membranes. In these studies, RPE cells in CNV membranes appeared as atrophic cells, a consequence of a disease that starts in the RPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. However, we found that other CNV membranes contained RPE cells appearing to be functional active cells. These cells expressed voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The currents activate at relatively positive potentials, showed fast activation kinetics and were inhibited by the dihydropyridine nifedipine. With these characteristics, the currents were comparable with those in cells from eyes without CNV, mostly L-type channel currents. However, currents in cells from CNV membranes showed unusual fast inactivation kinetics, and the potential of half-maximal activation was shifted to more negative potentials. Thus, it could be that in these cells another voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel contributes to the observed Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents. Since application of nifedipine resulted in significant current inhibition without shifts in the voltage-dependent activation, the presence of nifedipine did not unmask the contribution by another Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel with different voltage-dependence to the whole-cell currents. Furthermore, we could also detect the presence of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 subunits in RPE cells from CNV tissues. Thus, it is likely that these L-type channels contribute, at least in part to the Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents in these cells. In all cells from CNV membranes, the voltage-dependent activation was shifted to more negative values, and the currents reached their maximum more rapidly. Thus, in RPE cells from CNV membranes, smaller depolarizing shifts in membrane potential led to faster activation of L-type channels, which, in turn, generated larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> influxes into the cell. These differences could be again due to an anomalous mole fraction effect on different Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. Another reason for this might be a higher pp60<sup>c-src</sup>-dependent stimulation of L-type channels. CNV tissue represents a growth-factor-rich environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>] that should increase the pp60<sup>c-src</sup> activity in general. Furthermore, intracellular application of pp60<sup>c-src</sup> to RPE cells from control eyes resulted in faster inactivation of L-type channel currents and has been found to shift the potential of the half-maximal activation to more negative values in rat RPE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Since intracellular application of pp60<sup>c-src</sup> did not further increase L-type channel activity in RPE cells from CNV membranes, it appears that L-type channels in these cells are maximally stimulated by this tyrosine kinase. This is supported by the observation that inhibition of pp60<sup>c-src</sup> in cells from CNV membranes reduced the L-type channel activity to the same level as in cells from control eyes.</p><p>RPE cells from CNV membranes not only maintained the expression of nifedipine-sensitive voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, but the VEGF secretion rate is also dependent on the activity of these channels. Application of nifedipine or the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel inhibiting (+) enantiomer of BayK8644 significantly reduced the VEGF-A secretion to the same level. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activating (-) enantiomer of BaK8644 slightly, but not significantly, increased VEGF-A secretion by RPE cells from CNV membranes. This is not unlike experiments where intracellular application of src-kinase was used to stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activities in CNV RPE cells. Here, also, no further stimulatory effect was observed. Several angiogenic and growth factors are present in CNV membranes. Vitronectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>], a major component of drusen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>], VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>] via KDR/flk-1 receptor expressed by RPE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>], or IGF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>] act via activation of the src-subtype tyrosine kinase, and many are produced by the RPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>] and bFGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. We propose that the secretion of these factors is regulated by L-type channels at the beginning of the disease. In the progression of the disease growth of CNV tissue is promoted by VEGF-A secretion under control of nifedipine-sensitive voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The CNV membranes, which were found to contain RPE cells with active Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, might reflect a state of active CNV development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity and VEGF secretion rate appears to be higher in cells from CNV tissues compared to cells from eyes without CNV. Immunohistological analysis of RPE cell cultures from CNV tissues revealed that these cultures contained homogeneous RPE cells. RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of the RPE marker RPE65 in these cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. The presence of endothelial cells could be excluded by absence of endothelial factor 8 staining, and the presence of glia cells could by excluded by absence of GFAP staining. It is unlikely that cultured photoreceptors or neurons were present.</p><p>It is intriguing to argue that this might be a pathophysiological effect. However, this could also be an effect resulting from a different reaction to the experimental procedures. In contrast, taking the different Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel properties into account it might be that RPE cells in the proliferating CNV tissue underwent a transdifferentiation into a different phenotype, which is characterized by predominant growth factor secretion. This phenotype is maintained in culture as can be seen by the conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel characteristics. As already stated, these characteristics could be due to the expression of additional Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subtypes.</p><p>In summary, we showed for the first time that regulation of the angiogenic factor secretion rate by human RPE cells involves the activation of voltage-dependent L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Since a changed growth factor secretion by the RPE is thought to play a role in the induction of various eye diseases involving cell proliferation, voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels or their regulatory proteins could be included as targets in therapeutic strategies acting directly at the secretion site of angiogenic factors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Sarah Coupland for important helpful discussions and Marianne Boxberger for excellent technical assistance.
