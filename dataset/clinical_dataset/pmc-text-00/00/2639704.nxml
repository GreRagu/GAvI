While instructions for the recruitment of specific factors onto regulatory sites are partially stored in the sequence, DNA should also be decorated with the correct epigenetic markers to permit functional interactions between trans-acting factors and DNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a powerful technique which takes a snapshot of the genome together with its associated proteins. This method is currently the common method of choice (i) to map proteins onto their genomic targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004479-deBelle1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004479-Kim1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and (ii) to understand the chromatin context of functional genomic sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004479-Solomon1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004479-Barski1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

We found two novel tissue-specific promoters for <italic>PKRCBP1</italic> and <italic>SULF2</italic> by utilising the histone code of active promoters.</p><p>We went on to locate several putative tissue specific distal regulatory elements (enhancers, silencers and insulators) and we observed striking differences in the histone code profiles in the two cell lines examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004479-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004479-g005">5</xref>). The differences in H3K27me3 profiles between the two cell lines suggested that H3K27me3 behaves as an antagonist of activatory histone modifications such as H3Ac, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 in HeLa S3 cells whereas in NT2/D2 no such relation is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004479-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004479.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p><p>The 20q13.12 region has been implicated in several disease studies and the histone code, expression and reporter gene assays provided here would provide a framework to integrate sequence variation data and aid the design of functional studies to characterise disease causing variants. This systematic approach can be applied to all genomic intervals resulting from genome wide association studies of common disease and other complex traits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004479.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Size distributions of ChIP samples prepared by crosslinking with 0.37&#x00025; formaldehyde for 15 minutes from HeLa S3 (Lane 11) and NT2/D1 (Lane 12) cells run on Agilent BioAnalyser.</p><p>(0.04 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004479.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004479.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Histograms of enrichment signals of all antibodies in HeLa S3 and NT2/D1 cells.
