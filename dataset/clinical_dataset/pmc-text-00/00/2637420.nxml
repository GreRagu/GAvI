To date protein-protein, protein-DNA, and protein-RNA interactions were systematically investigated, which is in contrast to interactions with small ligands. We investigate the role of covalent and non-covalent bonds in protein-small ligand interactions using a comprehensive dataset of 2,320 complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology and Principal Findings</title><p>We show that protein-ligand interactions are governed by different forces for different ligand types, i.e., protein-organic compound interactions are governed by hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts, and covalent bonds; protein-metal ion interactions are dominated by electrostatic force and coordination bonds; protein-anion interactions are established with electrostatic force, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals contacts; and protein-inorganic cluster interactions are driven by coordination bonds. We extracted several frequently occurring atomic-level patterns concerning these interactions. For instance, 73&#x00025; of investigated covalent bonds were summarized with just three patterns in which bonds are formed between thiol of Cys and carbon or sulfur atoms of ligands, and nitrogen of Lys and carbon of ligands. Similar patterns were found for the coordination bonds. Hydrogen bonds occur in 67&#x00025; of protein-organic compound complexes and 66&#x00025; of them are formed between NH- group of protein residues and oxygen atom of ligands. We quantify relative abundance of specific interaction types and discuss their characteristic features. The extracted protein-organic compound patterns are shown to complement and improve a geometric approach for prediction of binding sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and Significance</title><p>We show that for a given type (group) of ligands and type of the interaction force, majority of protein-ligand interactions are repetitive and could be summarized with several simple atomic-level patterns.

Ma's report shows that several structurally conserved residues could be used to distinguish between binding sites and general exposed surface; for instance, conservation of Trp, Phe, and Met residues on the protein surface was shown to be associated with a higher likelihood of formation of a binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Ma1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The principles that govern protein-metal ion interaction were recently reviewed by Dudev and Lim.

On the other hand, although characterization and prediction of protein-ligand interaction sites has attracted attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Burgoyne1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Vajda1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, the protein-ligand interactions were never systematically studied and the rules that govern these interactions were not yet fully disclosed. The protein-ligand recognition is usually performed using an approach in which the protein and the ligand are considered as complementary surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Zauhar1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, or by executing the actual docking process and calculating the protein-ligand interaction energies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Carlsson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. A recent study by Thornton's group reveals that pockets binding the same ligand show greater variation in their shapes than can be accounted for by the conformational variability of the ligand, which suggests that the geometrical complementarity is not sufficient to drive molecular recognition process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Kahraman1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. This prompts our investigation into the interactions between proteins and ligands, in which we analyze both covalent bonds (normal covalent bonds and coordination bonds) and non-covalent bonds (electrostatic force, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals force). We focus on studying small ligands that exclude proteins, peptides, and nucleotides which were already investigated by other groups. Our aim is to find frequent regularities (patterns) that could be used to summarize interactions between the protein and the considered ligands. We analyze each of the major types of bonds for the ligands that are grouped into four categories including organic compounds, metal ions, inorganic anions, and inorganic clusters. In spite of inclusion of proteins characterized by low sequence identity and the diversity of the considered ligands, we found interesting and frequently occurring atomic-level patterns for several types of the considered ligands. We note that &#x0201c;atomic-level&#x0201d; term refers to the fact that patterns concern interactions between individual atoms of the residue and the ligand and it has no relation with the resolution of the considered crystal structures. Although the extracted patterns have been described in the literature, a comprehensive, in terms of the wide range of interaction and ligand types, overview of such interactions was not attempted. We systematically and conveniently summarize several major different interactions, we discuss specific details of these interactions across different residue types and ligands, e.g., the number of residues and the residues types that are involved in the coordination bonds with specific metal ions, and we quantify their relative abundance, which can be used to asses their importance in protein-ligand interactions. We also show, using a case study that concerns recent blind (without the knowledge of the ligand) geometric method for prediction of the binding sites, that usage of several patters in tandem improves the binding site predictions and that the sites predicted using patterns are complementary to the results based on the geometric analysis of the protein surface. Discovery of such interaction patterns would not only provide a comprehensive overview of protein-ligand interactions, but it would also facilitate design of binding site prediction methods and high-throughput molecular docking procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Normal covalent and coordination bonds</title><p>The interaction between a non-hydrogen atom <italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub> of a residue and a non-hydrogen atom <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub> of a ligand is defined as the covalent bond if the residue and the ligand do not have the opposite charge that would result in electrostatic force and the distance <italic>d</italic> of these two atoms satisfies<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004473.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where radius(<italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic>) represents the radius of <italic>A<sub>i</sub></italic>.

Therefore, if a metal ion forms the covalent bond with another atom, the pair of electrons shared by the metal ion and the second atom should be provided by the other atom.

The length of these chains varies between 20 and 1083, some short sequences are fragments of protein chains, and both monomers and oligomers are included. The protein and a ligand are assumed to interact with each other when at least one pair of non-hydrogen atoms, one from the protein and one from the ligand, can be found within 3.5&#x000c5; distance.

Excluding the water molecule, all molecules annotated as &#x0201c;HET&#x0201d; in PDB, which includes organic compounds and ions, were taken as ligands. This excludes protein chains, peptides and nucleotides. As a result, 7759 pockets which have at least one contact with the considered ligand were extracted from the 2320 chains.</p><p>Among the 7759 complexes, some of the ligands appear multiple times, some are similar and could be grouped together and the same/similar ligands bind to a variety of pockets. To facilitate analysis of the protein-ligand interactions we select only these ligands that occur frequently and we group them into several categories. The ligands that bind to at least 100 pockets cover 59.4&#x00025; of the considered complexes. Among these ligands, GOL, EDO, NAG, and ACT are organic compounds, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Cd<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> are metal ions, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x02212;</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3&#x02212;</sup>, Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, Br<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and I<sup>&#x02212;</sup> are inorganic anions. Additionally, some inorganic clusters, i.e., Fe-S cluster, also bind to a relatively large number of pockets. Therefore, the considered ligands (including those that occur in less than 100 pockets) are grouped into four categories: organic compounds, metal ions, inorganic anions, and inorganic clusters. We analyze total of 3685 organic compounds (that include 560 distinct types), 1682 metal ions (25 types), 1837 inorganic anions (19 types), and 54 inorganic clusters (9 types), which cover (3685&#x0002b;1682&#x0002b;1837&#x0002b;54)/7759&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;93.5&#x00025; of all extracted pockets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Summary of the interaction patterns</title><p>The protein pocket-ligand interactions are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004473-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

For instance, Ma's study suggests that the mycobacterium tuberculosis LipB enzyme transferase functions as a cysteine/lysine dyad acyltransferase, in which two invariant residues (Lys-142 and Cys-176) are likely to function as acid/base catalysts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Ma2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. We observe that the tuberculosis LipB protein &#x02013;decanoic acid complex is linked by thioether bond formed between Cys-176 and carbon-3 of decanoic acid. Zoltowski's study shows that formation of thioether bond between Cys thiol and the flavin C4a position is a response upon the blue-light excitation; attack of the thiol at C4a reduces the flavin ring, breaks aromaticity, and bleaches the absorption bands at 450 and 478 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Zoltowski1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>..

In both cases, the distributions are similar, i.e., Arg, Lys, Ser, Thr, and Asn establish the largest number of hydrogen bonds with both the organic compounds and the DNA molecules, while Phe, Met, Cys, and Pro establish the smallest number of hydrogen bonds with both types of ligands. The two AAs that establish the highest number of hydrogen bonds, Arg and Lys, are characterized by a larger relative number of bonds in the case of the binding with DNA, although we emphasize that the order of AAs in both cases is consistent. This suggests that the ability of AAs to establish hydrogen bonds could be an intrinsic characteristic of the AA itself, which is independent of the type of the ligand.</p><p>The negatively charged residues Asp and Glu did not exhibit strong affinity towards establishing hydrogen bonds in spite of having relatively high solvent accessibility and inclusion of two oxygen atoms in their side chains. We observe that Asp and Glu form the largest number of hydrogen bonds (278 and 300) when the AA serves as acceptor. At the same time they form only 103 and 53 hydrogen bonds when they serve as donors, which is relatively small when contrasted with the number of hydrogen bonds formed by other hydrophilic residues, e.g., 1555 for Arg and 802 for Lys. This low affinity to form hydrogen bonds could be explained by considering that the carboxyl groups of Asp and Glu often lend their H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to solution, and as a result the two oxygen atoms on the carboxyl group are not bonded to hydrogen atom and cannot serve as donor when forming the hydrogen bond.</p><p>The most frequently formed hydrogen bond is established between NH- group (as the donor) of an AA and the oxygen atom of an organic compound. This type of the hydrogen bond covers 5206/7914&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;65.8&#x00025; of all hydrogen bonds. To compare, the NH- group of organic compound serving as the donor and the oxygen atom of AAs account for only 325 hydrogen bonds. The surface patch that is characteristic for NH- group has high potential to form hydrogen bonds with organic compounds.

Three of them, Arg118, Arg292, and Arg371, are spatially adjacent and they form 5 hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms of 49A, while the other residues in the pocket establish only 2 hydrogen bonds.

Since the charge is not evenly distributed over the AAs, we analyzed which non-hydrogen atom of Asp/Glu is the closest to the metal ions. Among 1098 complexes involved the electrostatic force, metal ions formed electrostatic interaction with Asp and Glu 1511 times (in some complexes more than 1 electrostatic interaction is formed). In the case of 1385 out of above 1511 interactions, the oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group of Asp and Glu are the closest to the metal ion. This suggests that these two oxygen atoms could be more negatively charged than other atoms in the side chains.</p><p>Metal ions were observed to form coordination bonds with up to 6 atoms of a given protein, i.e., in chain A of 4-chlorobenzoyl coenzyme A dehalogenase protein (PDB entry 1NZY) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Benning1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, the calcium ion is coordinated with oxygen atoms of Gly49, Leu202, Ala203, Ala205, Thr207 and Gln210.

Total of 2345 coordination bonds are formed among the 1138 protein-metal ion complexes that involve this type of bond. The nitrogen atom in the side chain of His forms 787 bonds with the coordinating metal ions, sulfur atom of Cys forms 434 coordination bonds with metal ions, and oxygen atom (of any AA except Asp/Glu since interaction between metal ion and Asp/Glu is considered to be based on the electrostatic force) forms 1039 coordination bonds. The bonds based on these three atoms correspond to (787&#x0002b;434&#x0002b;1039)/2345&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;96.4&#x00025; of all coordination bonds. The strong affinity of the oxygen to form coordination bonds with metal ion suggests that the interaction between the negatively charged Asp and Glu residues and metal ions could be a combination of both the coordination and the electrostatic force. The interaction between metal ions and Asp/Glu has been considered as coordination in many other studies. For instance, Angkawidjaja and colleagues reported that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is coordinated by the side chains of Asp153, Asp157, and Gln120, and the carbonyl oxygens of Thr118 and Ser144 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Angkawidjaja1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>; similarly, Declercq and coworkers show interaction between Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and the coordinating oxygen atoms of Asp51, Asp53, Ser55, Phe57, Glu59 and Glu62 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Declercq1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result, the interactions between metal ions and Asp/Glu should be regarded as both coordination and electrostatic contacts if the distance between the corresponding atoms satisfies the definition of the coordination bond and the electrostatic contact.</p><p>Although the generic principles that govern protein-metal ion interactions were discussed in prior works <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Dudev1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Maret1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, e.g., interactions concerning Cys-rich Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding sites and affinity of interaction between Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Asp/Glu in protein cavities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Dudev1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, we could not find a systematic study that investigates how many residues and what residues types are involved (&#x0201c;preferred&#x0201d;) in the coordination bonds with specific metal ions, and that provides insights concerning similarities in the geometry of the coordination-based interactions with metal ions, which are discussed below.</p><p>Among the metal ions, Ag<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Cu<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>(Cu<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), Cd<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Co<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>(Co<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), Fe<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup>(Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>), Hg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Pb<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Sm<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> form coordination bonds with atoms of residues, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004473-t003">Table 3</xref>. Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> forms coordination bonds in the largest number of pockets. This ion is coordinated by atoms of at most 4 residues in a given pocket and it favors to be coordinated by 3 or 4 residues. The second highest number of pockets that involve coordination bonds with a metal ion concerns Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. These ions are coordinated by atoms of up to six residues in a pocket, and they prefer to form the coordination bonds with 4 or 5 residues. Coordination bonds with Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Cd<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions involve 228 and 109 pockets, respectively.

The residue groups that are coordinated by at least 10 metal ions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004473-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004473-g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004473-g006">6</xref>.

We note that except for Cys, which occurs twice as often in the protein-protein interaction interfaces when compared with the protein-organic compound binding pocket (3.1&#x00025; vs. 1.5&#x00025;), other AAs occur with similar frequency for both types of interactions. This similarity indicates that protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions could be determined by same types of forces and thus current protein-ligand docking techniques could be potentially adopted for protein-protein docking.</p><fig id="pone-0004473-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004473.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Percentage of occurrence of amino acids in the protein-organic compound binding pockets (gray bar) and in protein-protein interaction interfaces (black bar).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004473.g008"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Overlap and coverage of the interaction patterns</title><p>The 11 patterns that concern covalent bonds, coordination bonds and hydrogen bonds, see the bottom layer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004473-g001">Figure 1</xref>, appear in 2013 protein-organic compound complexes, 1138 protein-metal ion complexes, 1115 protein-anion complexes, and 53 protein-inorganic cluster complexes, which corresponds to (2013&#x0002b;1138&#x0002b;1115&#x0002b;53)/7759&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;55.7&#x00025; of all protein-ligand complexes.

Since organic compounds are the largest group among the four considered types of ligands and since majority of the oral drugs are based on the organic compounds, we design and test a na&#x000ef;ve method to predict the binding sites for the organic compounds that utilizes the knowledge of the four corresponding interaction patterns shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004473-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The predictions are made using a dataset that consists of 901 proteins that was introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Brylinski1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, in which the pairwise sequence identity is below 35&#x00025;. Over 90&#x00025; of these chains interact with only one organic compound, and the remaining chains interact with 2 or 3 compounds. Other types of ligands, e.g., metal ions, may bind to some of the chains, however, the binding sites of these ligands are not considered.</p><p>The prediction procedure follows a sequence of three steps:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Calculate a grid encompassing the protein structure using the Ligsite<sup>CSC</sup> program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Huang1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

Only the atoms on the protein surface are considered. The interaction patterns for organic compounds include hydrogen bond (formed between NH- group of residue and oxygen atom of ligand) and covalent bonds. The actual counts of the hydrogen bonds and covalent bonds cannot be computed since this is a blind prediction. Instead, we count NH- group within the <italic>R</italic> radius to reflect potential hydrogen bonds. For the covalent bonds, we count sulfur atoms to reflect potential thioether and disulfide bonds.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sort the grid points in the descending order based on the computed counts. The first prediction corresponds to the top scoring grid point. The subsequent predictions correspond to the points with the largest scores which are at least 5&#x000c5; away from any accepted prediction.</p></list-item></list><p>The predictions are evaluated based on the distance between the predicted site and the actual position of the ligand, i.e., a prediction is assumed correct if the distance is smaller than a cut-off threshold value, which is varied between 1 and 10&#x000c5;. For a given protein structure, 5 potential binding sites are predicted, which follows the procedure performed in relevant recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Huang1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. More specifically, if any of the 5 predicted binding sites is less than a certain distance (<italic>D</italic>) from any atom of the ligand, the prediction for this protein is assumed correct. This is motivated by the fact that the input dataset provides incomplete information, i.e., some actual binding sites could be missing which implies that some predictions that are far from the ligands included in the dataset could be potentially correct. The success rate is defined as the number of the correctly predicted proteins divided by size of the dataset.</p><p>The pattern-based method is compared with Ligsite<sup>CSC</sup> that identifies pockets on the protein surface based on a geometrical analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Huang1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, and which extends Ligsite method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Hendlich1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Ligsite<sup>CSC</sup> is shown to perform comparably well or better when compared with several other binding site predictors such as Ligsite, CAST, PASS, and SURFNET <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Huang1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. We also implemented a baseline predictor by random selection of five solvent grid points that are less than 5&#x000c5; from the protein surface. Two versions of our scanning-based approach are considered, one that uses both hydrogen and covalent bonds patterns, and the other that uses only the hydrogen bond pattern. The radius <italic>R</italic> is set to 8&#x000c5; since for this value 1&#x00025;&#x02013;5&#x00025; higher success rate is achieved when compared with other values between 5 and 10&#x000c5;. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004473-g009">Figure 9</xref> compares the predictions. The na&#x000ef;ve method based on the interaction patterns is inferior to Ligsite <sup>CSC</sup>, i.e., our success rate is about 10&#x00025; lower than that of Ligsite <sup>CSC</sup> for <italic>D</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2 to <italic>D</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10. This is not surprising since the four interaction patterns do not cover all protein-organic compound interactions as discussed above and since 29&#x00025; of the organic compounds bind to protein only through van der Waals contacts. We observe that both methods are superior to the random predictions. We also observe that adding the patterns concerning covalent bonds improves the success rates by 1 to 2&#x00025; across different <italic>D</italic> values, which shows that combining multiple patterns is helpful. This improvement is due to the inclusion of thiol of Cys, which potentially forms thioether and disulfide bonds.</p><fig id="pone-0004473-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004473.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Performance of blind binding site predictors including the pattern-based method, Ligsite<sup>CSC</sup>, and a random baseline predictor.</title><p>The <italic>y</italic> axis shows success rate, i.e., fraction of proteins with minimum distance between the top five predicted binding sites and any atom of a ligand in the native complex that is smaller or equal to the distance displayed on the <italic>x</italic> axis.

For example, for the Anguilla anguilla agglutinin protein (PDB entry 1K12), the 5 prediction generated by Ligsite <sup>CSC</sup> are at least 11 &#x000c5; away from the ligand, while one of our predictions is only 0.67&#x000c5; from the compound, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004473-g010">Figure 10</xref>. This motivated a hybrid approach in which predictions from the two methods are combined by taking the top two predictions from Ligsite<sup>CSC</sup> and the top three pattern-based predictions (on average the third best pattern-based prediction is better than third best prediction from Ligsite<sup>CSC</sup>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004473-g009">Figure 9</xref> shows that the results based on the merged predictions are better than the results from individual methods, especially for low values of <italic>D</italic>.

This study presents and investigates several frequently occurring interaction patterns for atomic-level protein-ligand interactions. The considered protein pocket-ligand complexes were grouped into four categories: protein-organic compound, protein-metal ion, protein-anion, and protein-inorganic cluster complexes. These groups cover 93.5&#x00025; of all protein-ligand complexes from PDB and we show that they are governed by different types of interaction forces. The protein-organic compound complexes are governed by the hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts and covalent bond. The protein-metal ion complexes are based on the electrostatic force and coordination bonds while the protein-anion complexes are governed by the electrostatic force, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. Finally, the protein-inorganic cluster complexes are established mostly due to the coordination bonds.</p><p>We present several frequently occurring interaction patterns, defined in terms of prevalent interactions between specific atoms of specific residue in the protein's pocket and specific atoms of the ligand, for the abovementioned four groups and for the specific types of interaction forces. We quantify relative abundance of specific interaction types and discuss their characteristic features such as commonly interacting amino acid types. Total of 10 interaction patterns that occur in 56&#x00025; of all considered complexes were found. For example, we show that 66.9&#x00025; of the protein-organic compound complexes involve hydrogen bonds and that 65.8&#x00025; of these hydrogen bonds are formed between the NH- group of the protein's residue and the oxygen atom of the organic compound. As a result, we believe that the geometric and electrostatic complementary, which are used for molecular recognition, should be supplemented by implementation of hydrogen bond(s) in the case of the protein-organic compound complexes. As another example, only four interaction patterns are sufficient to summarize significant majority, i.e., 73&#x00025;, of normal covalent bond interactions between proteins and ligands; they include the covalent bond between the thiol of Cys residue and the carbon atom of the ligand (thioether bond), the thiol of Cys residue and the sulfur atom of the ligand (disulfide bond), and the nitrogen atom of Lys residue and the carbon atom of the ligand. We also show that the AAs serve as donors for significant majority of these hydrogen bonds. We observe that most of the inorganic anions interact with positively charged AAs including Arg, His, and Lys.</p><p>We show that the organic compounds form hydrogen bonds more frequently with hydrophilic AAs when compared with hydrophobic AAs, which is consistent with results obtained for protein-DNA interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004473-Luscombe1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that the ability of AAs to establish hydrogen bonds could be an intrinsic characteristic of a given AA, which is independent of the ligand type. We also found that protein-organic compound binding pockets and protein-protein interaction interfaces share similar AA composition, which may imply that these interactions are determined by the same types of forces.</p><p>We also demonstrate a practical application of the abovementioned patterns in the context of blind prediction of binding sites for organic compounds. Our analysis reveals that a scanning method based on simple counts of the occurrence of the patterns provides predictions that complement existing methods that are based on the geometrical analysis of the protein surface.</p><p>To conclude, we show that for a given type (group) of ligands and a given type of the interaction force, majority of protein-ligand interactions are repetitive and could be summarized with several simple atomic-level patterns. These interaction patterns not only provide a comprehensive overview of protein-ligand interactions, but they also may have profound implications for development of molecular docking procedures and in building of binding site prediction methods.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0004473-Stelzl1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
