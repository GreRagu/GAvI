Two commercial IFN-&#x003b3; release assays (IGRAs), namely T-SPOT.<italic>TB </italic>and QuantiFERON<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-TB Gold In-Tube (QFGT), have been recently developed. These methods show acceptable diagnostic accuracy for active TB in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and have better correlation with tuberculosis exposure than the TSTs in contact tracing for revealing latent infections (LTBI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, pediatric data are limited, and studies evaluating the performance of IGRAs in children have been called for especially in low-incidence countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In Finland the incidence of TB is low, 5.6/100 000 inhabitants in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Only zero to six child TB diagnoses per annum has been registered during the last ten years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Universal BCG vaccination of newborns was practiced until 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]</p><p>Between September 2004 and January 2007 our laboratory adapted the tests to the general needs in Finland.

Firstly, the results were expressed as a number of reactive spots/million lymphocytes. The lymphocyte count from isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) preparation was calculated with an automated hematologic analyzer (Advia<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>60, Bayer, Germany). Secondly, duplicate ELISPOT wells were used for each antigen and media. Thirdly, Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used as an additional positive control. Fourthly, we adopted a double cut-off policy, i.e. the responses below 25 spot/million lymphocytes were considered as non-reactive according to the guidelines by the manufacturer; the responses between 25 and 55 spots were considered borderline and over 55 spots were interpreted as reactive.

In accordance with the SOP of our laboratory, stimulation of blood cells was done in tubes of the manufacturer. However, for measurement of IFN-&#x003b3; levels, we used EIA of PeliKine Compact human EIA (Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). This resulted in a steeper calibration curve and ensured more accurate result interpretation in the cut-off zone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Two cut-off levels were applied. The samples showing a net reactivity (the reactivity of a sample minus the reactivity of the nil control) &#x0003c; 0.35 IU/ml were interpreted as non-reactive. Those showing reactivity between 0.35 and 0.50 IU/ml were interpreted as borderline and those with a reactivity exceeding 0.50 IU/ml were interpreted as reactive. For the internal quality control, an artificially prepared IFN-&#x003b3; solution to simulate a low reactive sample was used.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Improvement of the calibration curve for IFN&#x003b3;-measurement</bold>.

The fourth case was a 9-year-old boy from a highly endemic area whose TST induration was 11 mm but the B-TbIFN&#x003b3; remained non-reactive. Because of the lack of the gold standard for LTBI, in the last three cases the diagnosis was based primarily on extensive exposure to TB and positive TST, in accordance with the recommendations in our country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Performance characteristics of the IGRA-methods.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">Parameter</td><td align="center">Sensitivity (95% CI<sup>&#x000a7;</sup>)</td><td align="center">Specificity 95% CI)</td><td align="center">PPV<sup>&#x02020; </sup>(95% CI)</td><td align="center">NPV<sup>&#x02021; </sup>(95% CI)</td><td align="center">Accuracy (95% CI)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Method</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Ly-TbSpot</bold></td><td align="center">0.85</td><td align="center">1.00</td><td align="center">1.00</td><td align="center">0.96</td><td align="center">0.96</td></tr><tr><td align="left">n = 72</td><td align="center">(0.64 &#x02013; 0.95)</td><td align="center">(0.93 &#x02013; 1.00)</td><td align="center">(0.82 &#x02013; 1.00)</td><td align="center">(0.87 &#x02013; 0.99)</td><td align="center">(0.88 &#x02013; 0.99)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>B-TbIFN&#x003b3;</bold></td><td align="center">0.92</td><td align="center">0.91</td><td align="center">1.00</td><td align="center">0.96</td><td align="center">0.91</td></tr><tr><td align="left">n = 41</td><td align="center">(0.67 &#x02013; 0.99)</td><td align="center">(0.77 &#x02013; 0.97)</td><td align="center">(0.76 &#x02013; 1.00)</td><td align="center">(0.84 &#x02013; 0.99)</td><td align="center">(0.80 &#x02013; 0.97)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* Pre-test probability, &#x02020; Positive predictive value, &#x02021; Negative predictive value, &#x000a7;Confidence interval.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Agreement between Ly-TbSpot, B-TbIFN&#x003b3; and the TST</title><p>The calculated data are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>.

The modifications were aimed to avoid false positive interpretations. Because no method can guarantee 100% sensitivity and specificity, we made a pragmatic decision to offer the best possible specificity even at the cost of sensitivity. Changing of the cut-off levels of the commercial IGRA methods has been suggested by other investigators. Lee at al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] suggested lowering the cut-off in the QFGT method. This change would have resulted in a drop of specificity from 91.6% to 87.0% which we, contrary to Lee, do not regard as a minimal loss. Arend et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] also recommended dropping the cut-off of the QFGT to achieve a detection rate of potentially infected persons similar to that of TST. The recommendation is not acceptable for the reason that TST is by no means a gold standard. The sensitivity of QFGT could instead be improved e.g. by using more sensitive EIA techniques. In fact, although there was high agreement between IGRAs and TST in our studies, three earlier studies found a lower agreement: two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] performed on pediatric samples in low risk countries observed concordant results between the IGRAs but inferior specificity of the TST, and one large cohort study of TB disease in African children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] found lower agreement with the TST. In another cohort study of contact tracing, performed on Gambian children, the clinical sensitivity of the TST was found superior to that of the ELISPOT in diagnosing LTBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In that study, however, the discordance between the tests was not significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In a recent study from Gambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] comparing the new IGRAs to TST in contact tracing, ELISPOT was found more sensitive than the QFGT in the diagnosis of TB disease while equally sensitive in the diagnosis of LTBI. That study showed no significant discordance between IGRAs but the results of the TST were influenced by the BCG vaccination status. The observed discrepancies in the estimation of the three methods are most probably attributed to the differences in the research population, their vaccination status and exposure to other mycobacteria, and most importantly, in the variability of the methods' performance using variable threshold levels.</p><p>Our study raises several important issues. When performing TST, intradermal inoculation of PPD in children exposed to <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>may produce an excessive delayed type hypersensitivity reaction. Secondly, demonstration of the test variability around the cut-off zone in real laboratory settings convinces that interpretation of immunodiagnostic methods should take into account the method imprecision and utilize a grey zone.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The sensitivity and specificity of IGRA methods compares well with TST but do not cause exaggerated delayed type hypersensitivity reactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>(TSTs): Tuberculin Skin Tests; (TU): Tuberculin Unit; (IGRA): Interferon Gamma Release Assays; (TB): Tuberculosis; (LTBI): Latent Tuberculosis Infection; (BCG): Bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin; (SOP): Standard Operation procedure; Positive (PPV) and (NPV): Negative Predictive Values; (CI): Confidence Intervals; (PA): Proportions of Agreement; (ELISPOT): Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Spot Assay; (Ly-TbSpot): Modified T-SPOT.<italic>TB</italic>; (ELISA): Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay; (QFGT): QuantiFeronGold in Tube; (B-TbIFN&#x003b3;): Modified QFGT; (NK): Natural Killer cells; (PHA): Phytohemagglutinin; (PPD): Purified Protein Derivative; (HIV): Human Immunodeficiency Virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ET carried out statistical analysis and interpretation of the data and was involved in the drafting of the manuscript; TT and IS have contributed to the conception and design of the study, drafting and revision of the manuscript; ES is a clinician who treated presented cases, she contributed to the acquisition of the data and drafting of the manuscript.
