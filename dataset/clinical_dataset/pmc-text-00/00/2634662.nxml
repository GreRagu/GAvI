It often results in major economic losses because of the high rates of illness and death associated with the disease. ASF has the potential to spread rapidly and since a vaccine is currently not available, control options are limited to rapid diagnosis of the disease and culling of infected animals and animals in contact with them.</p><p>ASF virus (ASFV) infects wildlife hosts and ticks of <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> spp<italic>.</italic>, and these can provide a reservoir of virus that is not possible to eliminate. In Africa, where ASF is widespread, the virus causes long-term, persistent infections&#x02014;but no clinical manifestation of disease&#x02014;in warthogs (<italic>Phacochoerus africanus</italic>) and bushpigs (<italic>Potamochoerus porcus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). In contrast, ASFV causes clinical disease and high numbers of deaths in wild boars (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>). The disease has been reported in pigs from most sub-Saharan countries and continues to spread to previously uninfected countries within the region. In 1998, ASF was reported in Madagascar for the first time; it is now considered to be endemic. At the end of 2007, ASF was introduced on a second Indian Ocean island, Mauritius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>).</p><p>Once introduced into countries, ASF is difficult to eradicate for several reasons, including the presence of wildlife reservoirs, lack of a vaccine, insufficient laboratory support for rapid and accurate diagnosis, and inadequate funding for veterinary services to enforce the appropriate control measures. This situation was amply demonstrated in Portugal and Spain, where the disease remained endemic until the 1990s, after its introduction into Portugal in 1957 and again in 1960. Other European countries, the Caribbean, and Brazil have had outbreaks of ASF, but extensive control programs have led to successful eradication, with the exception of Sardinia, where ASF has remained endemic since 1982 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>).</p><p>The genetic characterization of the viral strain associated with disease outbreaks is important for tracing possible sources of infection and ensuring that appropriate diagnostic reagents are used. ASFV isolates have previously been characterized by restriction enzyme site mapping or sequencing of different genome regions. Partial sequencing of the <italic>B646L</italic> gene encoding the major capsid protein p72 has so far led to the identification of 22 ASFV genotypes. Twenty-one of these genotypes were identified in isolates from domestic pigs or from wildlife hosts in eastern and southern Africa. The level of diversity between isolates from these regions is attributed to the long-term evolution of virus within wildlife hosts. In contrast to the other genotypes, genotype I predominantly comprises isolates from domestic pigs in West and Central Africa, Europe, the Caribbean, and Brazil obtained during a 40-year period since 1957. Isolates belonging to genotype I share considerably higher sequence identity across the p72 gene compared to isolates from the sylvatic cycle, which suggests that this genotype probably evolved from a single source introduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). PCR amplification and sequencing of more variable genome regions have been used to distinguish between closely related isolates and identify virus subgroups within several of the 22 genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). The additional genome regions that have been described thus far include the <italic>E183L</italic> and <italic>CP204L</italic> gene regions, encoding the p54 and p30 proteins, respectively, as well as the central variable region within the open reading frame (ORF) <italic>B602L</italic>.</p><p>ASFV can infect pigs by a variety of mechanisms, including direct contact between pigs, bites from infected ticks, indirect transmission by means of fomites, and ingestion of infected meat. The main route by which ASF infections spread over long distances is thought to be infected meat products. The transcontinental spread of ASF has been a relatively rare event, and it was unexpected when, in June 2007, cases of ASF affecting domestic pigs in the Caucasus region of the former Soviet republic of Georgia were confirmed by the OIE ASF reference laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). It has been suggested that the outbreak started in April 2007 near the Black Sea Port of Poti. Catering waste, including infected pig meat from ships in the port, is considered to be the most likely source of the infection. As of July 9, 2007, the outbreak had spread to 56 of 61 districts in Georgia. Reports to OIE indicated that &#x0003e;80,000 pigs had died or been destroyed in Georgia. Outbreaks of ASF were also reported in neighboring regions, including the autonomous republic of Abkhazia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>). On August 29, 2007, ASF was confirmed in Armenia and on November 4, 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>), in Nagorno-Karabakh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>), a de facto independent republic that is officially part of Azerbaijan and near its border with Armenia. On November 5, 2007, infection of a wild boar was confirmed in the Russian Republic of Chechnya near the border with Georgia. To control the spread of disease, wild boars were killed in 17 different regions in Chechnya, and the slaughter of the entire pig population was ordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Further outbreaks of ASF were reported in Nagorno-Karabakh in April 2008, where it is believed that &#x02248;8,500 pigs have died as a result of disease since the beginning of the outbreaks.</p><p>Here we describe the genetic characterization of the ASFV isolates implicated in the 2007 outbreak of the disease in Georgia. Results of the analysis showed that the Georgia isolates group within genotype II, which suggests that the virus is closely related to ASFV isolates typically found in Mozambique, Madagascar, and Zambia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Virus Isolates</title><p>In June 2007, samples were collected from 2 pigs that were showing clinical signs of ASF.

Five tissues samples were collected from each pig, including serum and samples from the kidney, spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. The samples were subsequently submitted to the OIE reference laboratory, Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright, United Kingdom. The presence of ASFV in these samples was confirmed by pathogen isolation on primary leukocyte cultures, real-time PCR, and ELISA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Viral DNA Extraction, PCR Amplification, and Sequencing</title><p>Viral DNA was extracted directly from cell culture isolates or from suspensions of clinical samples by using the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s guidelines.

Sequence analysis of this region from the <italic>B602L</italic> gene (also designated central variable region ORF9L, 9RL) of &#x0003e;100 ASFV isolates has shown that the number of tandem repeat tetramers in individual genomes may vary from 7 to 34.

The discrepancy in the size of the respective fragments is due to sequences encoding 2 arrays of amino acid repeats, which vary in number and sequence. The nucleotide sequence of the <italic>E183L</italic> gene from the Georgia 2007 isolate was identical to sequences from 5 Madagascar isolates obtained from outbreaks that in 1998&#x02013;2003 (Mad 1/98, Ampani/99, Tolagna/99, Chrome/01, and Antani/03) and 2 Mozambican isolates (Moz 1/02, Moz 2/02) (<xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD3">Appendix Figure 2</xref>).

The 4 regions of the genome&#x02014;<italic>B646L, E183L, CP204L,</italic> and the variable region within the ORF <italic>B602L</italic>&#x02014;were amplified by PCR. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of these ORFs from samples collected at 2 different geographic locations in Georgia were then compared with ASFV isolates from other regions of the world. Because all DNA and amino acid sequences for each genome region from all tissue samples obtained from Georgia that we tested were identical, we concluded that the ASF outbreaks in Georgia and the surrounding regions were probably due to a single introduction of the virus. Sequence analysis of the p72 gene region placed the Georgian isolate within genotype II together with isolates from Madagascar, Mozambique, and Zambia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). Genotype II occurred in Mozambique in outbreaks in 1998&#x02013;2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>) and affected the northeastern provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula (which were most recently affected in 2004), the northwestern province of Tete, and the southern province of Maputo (most recently in 2005) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). Three other genotypes of ASFV have also been identified as having occurred in Mozambique&#x02014;genotypes II, V, and VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>).</p><p>The genotype II Madagascar isolate, MAD 1/98, was obtained from a domestic pig in 1998 during the first outbreak of ASF that affected the island country. The more recent Madagascar pig isolates obtained in 1999&#x02013;2003 are presumed to have derived from this first introduction because they belong to the same genotype. Mozambique has been speculated to be the most likely source of infection for the 1998 ASFV outbreaks occurring in Madagascar because the isolates from Mozambique were genotype II and identical across the <italic>B602L</italic> region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>). Before 1998, the island of Madagascar was free of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>). The genotype II isolate from Zambia (Lus 1/93) was isolated from an infected domestic pig in 1991, whereas the viruses from Mozambique were isolated from domestic pigs during outbreaks of the disease along the eastern coast of the country in 2002&#x02013;2005.</p><p>Further sequence analysis was performed on 2 other conserved regions of the ASFV genome; the ORFs <italic>E183L</italic> and <italic>CP204L</italic>, which encode the structural proteins p54 and p30, respectively. Analysis of the <italic>E183L</italic> gene showed that the Georgia 2007 isolates were most closely related to 4 isolates from Madagascar, which were in circulation in 1999&#x02013;2003, and 2 isolates from Mozambique but distinguishable from the group II isolate Lus 1/93 and the Mozambique isolates Moz 1/03 and Moz 1/05. Similarly, analysis of the <italic>CP204L</italic> gene encoding p30 showed the Georgia 2007 isolates were distinguishable from all other isolates, although they were most closely related to the 4 isolates from Madagascar in circulation in 1999&#x02013;2003, the Zambian Lus 1/93 isolate, and one of the Mozambique isolates (2/02).</p><p>Fragment size analysis has identified <italic>B602L</italic> as the most variable genome region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>). The variable region of <italic>B602L</italic> contains amino acid tetramers that vary in number and type. Sequence analysis of the <italic>B602L</italic> gene from the Georgian isolates identified 5 different amino acid tetramer sequences encoded in this genome region. One of these tetramer sequences was CTST, which is one of the less common tetramer sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>). The sequence of the <italic>B602L</italic> variable region from the Georgian isolate grouped it with isolates in circulation in Madagascar (1999&#x02013;2003) as well as isolates from Mozambique from outbreaks in 1960, 1961, 1963, 1970, and 1998.</p><p>The first case of ASF in Georgia was observed in the Samegrelo region on the west coast, which suggests a possible connection to the port of Poti on the Black Sea. One possibility is that that the virus entered Georgia through meat products since ASFV may remain viable for long periods in infected pig tissues, meat, and processed pig products. Most pigs in Georgia are kept on a free-ranging, scavenging system, and so access to or swill feeding of dumped port waste is possible. However, several events would be required to cause an outbreak, making this a relatively rare event and providing an explanation for the relatively few incidents of transcontinental spread of ASFV. Our analysis showed that the Georgia strain is most similar to isolates from Madagascar. However, since few ASFV samples are submitted for genotyping, it is possible that viruses belonging to genotype II may be more widespread. However, it seems likely that the source of infection of the Georgia 2007 outbreak is from the eastern side of southern Africa or Madagascar rather than west or central Africa or Sardinia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Appendix Table</title><p>Summary of African swine fever isolates obtained from 1960 through 2007 and compared in this study</p></caption><media xlink:href="08-0591_appT-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="N0x1cdbf50N0x1c51350" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Appendix Figure 1</title><p>Amino acid sequence alignment of the central variable region of B602L from different African swine fever virus isolates previously identified in genotypes II, V, VI, VIII, XX, XIX, and XXI.
