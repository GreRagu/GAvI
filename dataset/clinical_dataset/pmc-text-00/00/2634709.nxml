No known association between 8-oxo-dG, disease progression and survival exists in colorectal cancer (CRC). We examined levels of 8-oxo-dG in sporadic CRC to determine its relationship with pathological stage and outcome. A total of 143 CRC patients and 105 non-cancer patients were studied. Nuclear and cytoplasmic 8-oxo-dG was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Double immunofluorescence using 8-oxo-dG and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) antibodies localised cytoplasmic 8-oxo-dG. Apoptosis was detected using TUNEL. Nuclear staining levels were similar in tumour tissue and matched normal mucosa in both epithelial (<italic>P</italic>=0.22) and stromal (<italic>P</italic>=0.85) cells. Epithelial cytoplasmic staining was greater in tumour tissue (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Double immunofluorescence localised cytoplasmic 8-oxo-dG to mitochondria. Epithelial and stromal nuclear 8-oxo-dG decreased with local disease spread, but highest levels were found in distant disease (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). Survival was related to epithelial nuclear and stromal staining in normal mucosa (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and tumour (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) but was unrelated to cytoplasmic staining. Normal control cells in tissue from cancer patients with high levels of 8-oxo-dG failed to undergo cell death. 8-oxo-dG may be an important biomarker of disease risk, progression and survival for CRC patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>8-oxo-dG</kwd><kwd>oxidative damage</kwd><kwd>colon</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>survival</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Colorectal cancer is one of the commonest cancers in the Western World (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Ferlay <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) and genetic events associated with tumour initiation and progression have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990</xref>).

It is associated with aging and implicated in a variety of disease processes including atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib22">Pacifici and Davies, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib16">Maritim <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib30">Valko <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib18">Minuz <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Endogenous sources of reactive oxygen species production include oxidative phosphorylation and inflammatory cell activation, and despite multiple conserved redox modulating systems, a proportion of reactive oxygen species continuously escape the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The significance of reactive oxygen species within antioxidant systems and its role in carcinogenesis is not fully understood. Enhanced antioxidant mechanisms in gastrointestinal tumour cells <italic>in vivo</italic> are associated with chemo-resistance, metastasis and poor prognosis, whereas many <italic>in vitro</italic> studies suggest that antioxidant enzymes have tumour-suppressing properties (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib11">Janssen <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib27">Toh <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), although the majority of conflicting results may be explained by reference to the net redox status of malignant cells (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib13">Kinnula and Crapo, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The DNA adduct, 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanine (8-oxo-dG) is formed by the reaction of OH radical with the DNA guanine base. It is a pro-mutagenic lesion that mispairs with adenine leading to GC to TA transversions. This oxidative DNA damage is repaired primarily by the base excision repair pathway incorporating the glycosylases OGG1, MYH and NUDT1 (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">Chow <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Few data are available on 8-oxo-dG levels in colorectal diseases (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Dincer <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) and the levels of 8-oxo-dG in relation to disease progression and survival has not been studied in colorectal tumours.

We also studied 105 consecutive patients (median age 45 years; range, 17&#x02013;87 years; 41 men, 64 women) undergoing colonoscopy for investigation of altered bowel habit and whose investigations were normal. These investigations included histological examination of colonic biopsies, haematological indices and biochemical inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein).</p><p>Following surgery, tumours were fixed in 1&#x00025; formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tumours were staged using the WHO classification (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib20">Morson, 1976</xref>). There were 13 Stage I, 46 Stage II, 39 Stage III and 45 Stage IV cancers. Colorectal mucosal tissue remote from the tumour and adjacent to histologically normal mucosa was obtained for 99 of the 143 cases. Patients were followed up at 6 monthly intervals and median follow up of patients alive at the end of study was 6.7 years. Ethical approval was granted by the St Vincent's Hospital Ethics and Medical Research Committee to conduct this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue microarray construction</title><p>For all cancer cases, haematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded colorectal tumour blocks were used to identify specific areas of the cancer.

This solution was heated in a pressure cooker (Menarini Diagnostics, Berkshire, England) with the lid off for 20&#x02009;min at full power in an 800&#x02009;W microwave. Slides were placed in the pressure cooker, lid sealed and heated at full power until the pressure valve popped up (5&#x02013;7&#x02009;min). Slides remained incubated at full power for a further 4&#x02009;min. The pressure cooker was removed from the microwave and the lid removed once the pressure equalised (takes approximately 10&#x02009;min). Slides were washed in PBS and 0.05&#x00025; Tween for 10&#x02009;min. Non-specific binding was blocked using 10&#x00025; casein in PBS for 10&#x02009;min at room temperature. 8-oxo-dG mouse monoclonal antibody (Genox, Baltimore, MD, USA) was diluted 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;40 in antibody diluent (Dako) and incubated on slides for 2&#x02009;h at room temperature in a humidified chamber.

Intensity was graded as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) and 3 (strong). The median value of each parameter was calculated from the results of the four cores. The scoring was by consensus review (JS and JOS).

Cytoplasmic staining was unrelated to stage (data not shown). Long-term survival was closely associated with tumour stage (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) (data not shown). In addition, poor outcome was related to high levels of 8-oxo-dG epithelial nuclear staining in normal non-adjacent mucosa (uncorrected log-rank test, <italic>P</italic>=0.0003 (corrected for age, gender and tumour stage in the proportional hazards model, relative risk 2.2; 95&#x00025; confidence intervals 1.3&#x02013;3.6, <italic>P</italic>=0.002)) and tumour tissue (uncorrected, <italic>P</italic>=0.002 (corrected, RR 1.7; 95&#x00025; CI 0.8&#x02013;3.4; <italic>P</italic>=0.15)).

Normal colonic cells in tissue from patients without colorectal cancer who have high levels of 8-oxo-dG are seen to undergo apoptosis (upper panels). However, normal colonic cells in tissue from cancer patients with high 8-oxo-dG levels fail to undergo apoptosis (lower panels).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Several methods have been developed to measure 8-oxo-dG levels in biologic samples. These include high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection, gas chromatography and <sup>32</sup>P postlabelling (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib10">Halliwell, 1999</xref>). However, results from these labour-intensive methods have been difficult to reproduce and there is disagreement both with regard to actual values and variability within cells and tissue specimens. Indeed, a European Standards Committee on Oxidative DNA Damage (ESCODD) has been established because of such discrepancies with identification of drawbacks associated with these methods (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib9">Gedik and Collins, 2005</xref>). In this study, we used immunohistochemical methods as it allowed us to localise 8-oxo-dG to different cell types without the risk of artifactual production of 8-oxo-dG associated with DNA extraction and hydrolytic processes. This antibody is specific to oxidised DNA and does not recognise RNA (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib28">Toyokuni <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p><p>We found substantial staining of 8-oxo-dG in both the epithelial and stromal nuclei of tissues from the normal colon of both control and cancer patients in addition to cancer tissues taken from the latter. High levels of 8-oxo-dG have previously been detected in the blood of patients with various cancers including oesophagus, lung and colon (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib6">Gackowski <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib7">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Breton <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) whereas oxidative stress is also linked to chronic inflammatory states including inflammatory bowel diseases, known to be associated with colorectal cancer risk (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib24">Pohl <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">Dincer <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Other risk factors for colorectal cancer include obesity and insulin resistance, themselves closely associated with oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib29">Urakawa <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and it is clear that these various interrelationships are complex. Mechanisms whereby oxidative damage could result in cancer development have been proposed and a system that includes oxidative damage and stress resulting in the formation of pro-mutagenic 8-oxo-dG with subsequent widespread G:C to T:A transversions supports the mutator phenotype hypothesis (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib15">Loeb <italic>et al</italic>, 1974</xref>). Such a hypothesis seems plausible, although still remaining speculative (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib21">Olinski <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>We studied 8-oxo-dG staining in the colonic tissues of a large number of patients without structural bowel disease and found no association between oxidative damage and age. In relation to our cancer cohort, we found that tumour tissues had higher levels of cytoplasmic 8-oxo-dG than non-adjacent colonic mucosa. However, the main finding from our study was that high levels of 8-oxo-dG were associated with poor survival, both in uncorrected analyses and when corrected for tumour stage. This remained true even when patients with metastatic disease were excluded in secondary analyses. It is also clear from a review of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that it was only those patients with the highest levels of nuclear 8-oxo-dG staining who were at increased risk and that those with medium staining levels behaved similarly to those with low staining levels.</p><p>Our cutoff points were constructed arbitrarily by dividing our cohort into tertiles, but it is probable that much more powerful associations with outcome would be found using additional discriminatory analyses such as the maximal log-rank test (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib23">Peto <italic>et al</italic>, 1977</xref>). Our findings relating to colorectal cancer have not been described earlier, but high levels of 8-oxo-dG have been associated with poor outcome in non small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib19">Miyake <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib25">Shen <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) whereas oxidative damage in non-cancerous liver tissues also appears to predict recurrence of hepatocellular cancer (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib17">Matsumoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>As survival was associated with 8-oxo-dG staining and also closely associated with anatomical spread, one might have expected a positive association between 8-oxo-dG staining and advancing tumour stage. However, this was not the case, especially in those undergoing curative surgery. If anything, 8-oxo-dG nuclear staining was relatively high in early disease and declined somewhat with advancing tumour stage until the development of distant metastases when there was a sharp rise again. Thus, the effect of intranuclear oxidative damage on clinical progression was clearly independent of pathological stage, especially in those without distant metastases, as confirmed by our multivariate analyses. In contrast, although we found considerable cytoplasmic staining in epithelial cells, and further identified it as mitochondrial in nature, it is clear that this widespread mitochondrial damage was unimportant with regard to both anatomical and clinical disease progression.</p><p>What is the pathophysiological explanation for our findings in patients with and without colorectal cancer? Previous studies suggest that 8-oxo-dG accumulation may be due to decreased DNA repair capacity (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib8">Gackowski <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). We found that colonic cells with high levels of nuclear 8-oxo-dG taken from non-colorectal cancer patients readily undergo apoptosis. However, in cancer patients, normal colonic cells with high levels of 8- oxo-dG did not undergo cell death and it is possible that the mutator phenotype (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib14">Loeb <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) may predispose these cells to further accumulation of mutations and genomic instability. As to our findings in the different colorectal cancer stages, it is possible that the high levels of nuclear oxidative damage found in early stage disease may contribute to this mutator phenotype with a subsequent decline as tumours progress locally. In those with distant metastases, the sharp rise in nuclear 8-oxo-dG levels may correlate with a more hypoxic tissue environment in late stage metastatic disease with upregulation of HIF-1 and VEGF levels (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib12">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and it is clear that rises also relate to clinical progression independent of tumour stage. Ultimately, the role of 8-oxo-dG and reactive oxygen species in colorectal cancer remains speculative, but numerous epidemiological, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> animal studies suggest that oxidative damage may be important in cancer initiation and progression and that antioxidants may be cytoprotective. It will be interesting to further assess the precise contribution made by 8-oxo-dG and similar compounds to these systems.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Darren Gibbons Foundation and the Ellie Brady Foundation.
