Reducing Protein 		Tyrosine Phosphatase1B (PTP1B) abundance not only enhances insulin sensitivity and improves glucose metabolism but also protects 		against obesity induced by high fat feeding. PTP1B inhibitors such as Formylchromone derivatives, 1, 2-Naphthoquinone 		derivatives and Oxalyl aryl amino benzoic derivatives may eventually find an important clinical role as insulin sensitizers in 		the management of Type-II Diabetes and metabolic syndrome. We have carried out docking of modified oxalyl aryl amino benzoic 		acid derivatives into three dimensional structure of PTP1B using BioMed CAChe 6.1. These compounds exhibit good selectivity for 		PTP1B over most of phosphatases in selectivity panel such as SHP-2, LAR, CD45 and TCPTP found in literature. This series of 		compounds identified the amino acid residues such as Gly220 and Arg221 are important for achieving specificity via H-bonding 		interactions. Lipophilic side chain of methionine in modified oxalyl aryl amino benzoic acid derivative [1b (a2, b2, c1, d)] 		lies in closer vicinity of hydrophobic region of protein consisted of Meth258 and Phe52 in comparison to active ligand. Docking 		Score in [1b (a2, b2, c1, d)] is -131.740Kcal/mol much better than active ligand score -98.584Kcal/mol. This information can be 		exploited to design PTP1B specific inhibitors.	                  </p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Drug design</kwd><kwd>docking</kwd><kwd>oxalyl aryl amino benzoic acid derivatives</kwd><kwd>PTP1B</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Type-II Diabetes mellitus is the most common form of diabetes. In this case, patients can still produce insulin, but they do not produce enough or their bodies can't use it properly. At present, there are about 125 million people affected by the disease globally. It has been projected by the year 2010; the no. of persons with diabetes will double. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>]Reversible protein phosphorylation is the predominant strategy used to control the activity of proteins in eukaryotic cells. Approximately 30&#x000a2; of 10,000 proteins in a typical mammalian cell are thought to be phosphorylated. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref>] Many cellular functions could be artificially manipulated if one could exogenously control the activity of protein kinases and phosphatases. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>] This has led to intense interest in identifying small molecules capable of inhibiting action of specific kinases.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>] Major goal of new therapies for Type-II Diabetes is to potentiate action of insulin. One of key proteins involved in insulin signaling is insulin receptor. When insulin binds to its receptor, changes in intracellular confirmation of receptor result in o-phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>] This serves as first step in insulin signaling and it is followed by a cascade of intracellular events that mediate the physiological effects of insulin. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>] There is compelling evidence that protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B is primarily responsible for dephosphorylation of insulin receptor and therefore acts to downregulate insulin signaling. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] A PTP1B inhibitor would be expected to increase the half life of phosphorylated insulin receptor and enhance the effects of insulin. The development of PTP1B inhibitors began in early 1990 and continues today.

For calculating energy BioMed CAChe provides classical mechanics, quantum mechanics and includes solvent effects of water by using COSMO (Conductor-like screening Model, which approximates the dielectric screening energy of a solvent by the method of image charges).
