Tissue specific stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue, were initially thought to have a differentiation capacity limited to the tissue of origin. However, recent studies have shown that these cells may have the ability to differentiate into cells of mesodermal, endodermal, and ectodermal origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The term "mesenchymal stem cell" most often refers to stem cells derived from the stromal fraction of bone marrow, but can also be applied to stem cells derived from adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is also derived from the mesenchyme and contains a supportive stroma that is easily isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Both adipose derived stem cells (ASCs) and bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs) can be easily harvested in significant numbers and exhibit stable growth and proliferation in culture.</p><p>MSCs have garnered increasing amounts of attention for their potential use in cell-based therapies and in regenerative medicine because of several attractive features: (1) they are easily isolated by bone marrow aspiration or liposuction under local anesthesia; (2) they can be extensively expanded in culture without loss of differentiation potential; (3) MSCs can differentiate into multiple cell types; (4) MSCs have the ability to seek out sites of tissue injury and repair the tissue by differentiating to replace injured cells or by creating an environment favorable for the repair of damaged tissue by endogenous cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The utilization of MSCs derived from the adipose tissue or bone marrow of mice is appealing for use in extensive studies in the field of adult stem cell research due to the low cost of maintaining mice. These murine MSCs (mMSCs) may be used to study stem cell properties in an <italic>in vivo </italic>setting for the purposes of evaluating therapeutic strategies that may have clinical applications in the future.</p><p>Whenever cells are to be used in a transplantation scenario, the question of how to track the engraftment, persistence, and differentiation of the administered cells arises. Tracking the cells should help determine whether a tissue is repaired by the transplanted stem cells, by activation of host stem cells, or by host cells recruited by the transplanted stem cells to the site of injury.</p><p>Several reporter gene or tracking strategies are currently being developed to assist investigators with experimental stem cell therapies. Cells can be transfected or transduced with vectors carrying a fluorescent transgene, but these methods are limited by the efficiency of gene transfer and retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Other reporter genes may encode enzymes such as &#x003b2;-galactosidase (lacZ), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and firefly luciferase. These enzymes require the addition of substrates to visualize labeled cells, which may lead to background staining if endogenous enzymes can also process the added substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Fluorescent DNA binding dyes such as bis-benzimide are also available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], but are also limited by binding efficiencies and background fluorescence from DNA released from dead cells. Transplanting cells harvested from a male donor into a female host and searching for the Y-chromosome is also a simple and effective strategy for tracking cells, but this technique cannot be utilized in living cells.</p><p>One solution to this problem is to transplant cells with an easily detectable or identifiable genetic reporter element. An ideal reporter gene would (1) cause no adverse effects to the stem cells or host development; (2) be ubiquitously expressed in all transplanted cells; (3) be precisely localized to transplanted cells; (4) be reliably detected in living cells, tissue mounts, and fixed and paraffin-embedded sections; and (5) be compatible with visualization of other markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. For these purposes, an ideal approach is to harvest stem cells from a transgenic mouse strain expressing a transgene marker. These cells can be transplanted into non-transgenic mice without the complication of background staining.</p><p>One such transgene marker is enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). eGFP is an excellent reporter because it can be visualized in living cells in culture and has already been useful in monitoring gene expression, protein-protein interactions, and trafficking and localization <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. eGFP-expressing transgenic mice are readily available and are a possible source for murine ASCs (mASCs) and murine BMSCs (mBMSCs) which constitutively express eGFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These mice are uniformly green with the exceptions of hair and red blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The efficiency of establishing stable cell lines with an integrated eGFP gene is normally low, therefore cells from eGFP transgenic mice may prove more useful and easier to culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, employing eGFP as a means of tracking cells has a couple drawbacks. One limitation is that eGFP/GFP is thought to induce cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Intense excitation of the protein <italic>in vitro </italic>for extended periods of time can generate toxic free radicals, and the presence of GFP may also lead to increased DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. eGFP was also designed to be expressed in the cytosol of a cell, which could lead to toxic effects if present in high concentrations. In spite of these potential obstacles, cell lines from transgenic mice often look normal and healthy even though they express significant amounts of eGFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>This study seeks to characterize and compare four different groups of mMSCs consisting of mASCs and mBMSCs derived from C57Bl/6 mice and mASCs and mBMSCs derived from eGFP transgenic C57Bl/6 mice (GFPTgASCs and GFPTgBMSCs). Characteristics such as differentiation potential, colony forming unit capabilities, cell surface marker profiles, and growth kinetics of these four groups of cells were evaluated in order to give future investigators a clearer understanding of the properties of eGFP transgenic mMSCs (GFPTgMSCs). Mesenchymal stem cells derived from eGFP transgenic mice may prove useful in future testing and development of stem cell therapies and regenerative medicine applications because of their inherent stem cell properties and constitutive expression of the fluorescent protein eGFP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Morphology of Transgenic mMSCs</title><p>The morphology of transgenic mMSCs is consistent with that of normal mMSCs in that they are fibroblastic in appearance. mBMSCs and GFPTgBMSCs seem to be more spindle-shaped than mASCs or GFPTgASCs, thus individual mASCs and GFPTgASCs require more surface area on the culture dish due to their larger and more flattened shape. GFPTgMSCs fluoresce when examined through a FITC filter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), and remained fluorescent and maintained morphology through passage 10 (data not shown).

However, the mMSCs produced little proteoglycans in response to chondrogenic differentiation media. The inability of mMSCs from C57Bl/6 and other strains of mice to undergo efficient chondrogenesis has been noted previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and may be attributed to the lack of murine specific cytokines.</p></sec><sec><title>FACS analysis</title><p>Flow cytometric analysis of cell surface markers revealed that all of the mMSCs and GFPTgMSCs were virtually identical in their patterns of expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

Only a small amount of bone marrow and adipose tissue is available per mouse and harvesting these tissues can sometimes be problematic. Often there is unwanted growth of non-mesenchymal cells that can take over the culture. However, these challenges can be overcome to develop murine mesenchymal stem cell lines with consistently similar biologic properties. This study focused on comparing adipose derived and bone marrow derived stem cells from eGFP transgenic C57Bl/6 mice and normal C57Bl/6 mice. Even though these cells were isolated from 3&#x02013;4 donors for each cell type, the characterizations of these four different cell types are relatively comparable with few differences.</p><p>mMSCs from eGFP transgenic mice are similar in their fibroblastic morphology and in differentiation capability to those from non-transgenic mice. However, when mASCs and GFPTgASCs are compared with mBMSCs and GFPTgBMSCs there are clear distinctions. mASCs and GFPTgASCs appear more flattened and wider in diameter when compared to mBMSCs and GFPTgBMSCs. Both types of mBMSCs undergo osteogenic differentiation more readily than mASCs or GFPTgASCs. These distinctions point to tissue-specific differences between murine stem cells derived from adipose tissue and bone marrow. Perhaps mASCs contain more adipogenic committed progenitor cells compared with mBMSCs, and mBMSCs contain more osteogenic committed progenitor cells compared with mASCs. Finally, the expression of eGFP does not seem to affect the ability to differentiate along adipogenic or osteogenic lineages, and cells retain their fluorescence even after undergoing differentiation.</p><p>All four cell types were also analyzed by flow cytometry for specific cell surface markers. Cells were tested for expression of markers such as CD106, Sca-1, CD34, CD11b, and CD45. All cells exhibited very low expression of epitopes generally associated with hematopoietic cells such as CD34, CD11b, and CD45 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These results suggest that the cultures were virtually free of hematopoietic cells. Approximately half of the cells expressed CD106, which is a marker generally associated with mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Most cells expressed Sca-1, which is a marker associated with MSCs and also with hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The cell surface marker profiles of these transgenic and non-transgenic mASCs and mBMSCs are very similar to those previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The presence of eGFP appeared to have no effect on surface marker expression. Interestingly, mMSCs derived from both bone marrow and adipose tissue had similar cell surface marker profiles. This is not surprising since both cell types are isolated from the stromal cell fraction of the original tissue and are isolated based on their adherence to plastic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Comparisons of growth curves from the four cell types yielded interesting results. First, the GFPTgMSCs seemed to grow more slowly than their non-transgenic counterparts. However, the differences were not statistically significant due to variation among donors. Perhaps increasing the sample size of donors would decrease the amount of variation and illustrate a significant difference in growth kinetics. Secondly, it seems that adipose-derived murine stem cells grow more slowly than those derived from bone marrow. Again, the differences were not statistically significant due to variation among donors. Perhaps the media used to culture mASCs should be customized to maximize growth potential.</p><p>Finally, all four cell types readily formed single-cell derived colonies when plated at low density. The presence of eGFP in the transgenic cells did not seem to affect the proliferative capacity of the cells after expansion in culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The availability of mesenchymal stem cells with the potential for the long-term stable expression of a genetic marker has important applications for the advancement of stem cell research.

The cells were then plated in an 8.8 cm<sup>2 </sup>culture plate and washed with media twice over a period of 6 hours to remove hematopoietic cells. CEM consists of Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 9% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA), 9% horse serum (HS; Hyclone Laboratories, Logan UT), 100 U/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 0.25 &#x003bc;g/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen), and 12 &#x003bc;M L-glutamine (Invitrogen).</p><p>Adherent cells were washed after 24 hours, and fresh CEM was added every 3 to 4 days until cells reached approximately 80% confluency. The cells were then washed with PBS and lifted by incubation with 0.5 ml 0.25% trypsin/1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Invitrogen) for 2&#x02013;5 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. The trypsin was neutralized in 5 ml CEM, and all the cells (passage 1) were replated into a 56.7-cm<sup>2 </sup>culture dish. The cells were either frozen in liquid nitrogen or expanded further. For freezing, the cells were re-suspended and frozen in 5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 15% FBS, and15% HS in IMDM by placement in a -20&#x000b0;C freezer for 1 hour, then a -80&#x000b0;C freezer for 1 hour, and finally stored in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>mASCs and GFPTgASCs were isolated from inguinal fat pads. The tissue was washed extensively with PBS containing 200 U/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 200 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 0.50 &#x003bc;g/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen). The fat was minced with sterile scalpels in 0.075% Collagenase Type I and incubated with the collagenase for 1 hour. The collagenase was then neutralized with CEM and the mixture was re-suspended with vigorous pipetting. The tissue was then washed with PBS and filtered through a 70 &#x003bc;m nylon mesh filter. The suspension was centrifuged at 400 &#x000d7; g for 4 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C, and the pellet was re-suspended in 2 ml CEM. The cells were then plated on a 20.8 cm<sup>2 </sup>culture dish, and the media was replaced after 24 hours. Adherent mASCs were cultured in the same manner as mBMSCs.</p></sec><sec><title>mMSC Differentiation</title><p>Cells were plated in 6-well plates at 1000 cells/well and incubated in CEM for 3 days. For osteogenesis, the cultures were then incubated in CEM supplemented with 20 mM glycerol phosphate, 50 ng/mL thyroxine, 1 nM dexamethasone, and 50 &#x003bc;M ascorbate 2-phosphate (all from Sigma, St Louis, MO). The media was changed 2 times per week for 2 weeks. The cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 20 minutes at RT and stained with Alizarin Red, pH 4.1 (Sigma) for 20 minutes at RT.</p><p>For the quantitative osteogenesis assay, cells were plated in 96-well plates at 100 cells/well and cultured as aforementioned for 2 weeks. The cells were then stained with Alizarin Red and de-stained with 10% cetylpyridinium chloride for 30 minutes. The amount of Alizarin Red was determined by measuring the optical density (OD) of the solution at 560 nm. The results were then normalized to the protein contents of the samples.</p><p>For adipogenesis, the cultures were incubated in CEM supplemented with 5 &#x003bc;g/mL insulin, 50 &#x003bc;M indomethacin, 1 &#x003bc;M dexamethasone, and 0.5 &#x003bc;M 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; all from Sigma). The medium was changed 2 times per week for 2 weeks. The cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 20 minutes at RT and stained with 0.5% Oil Red O (Sigma) in methanol (Sigma) for 20 minutes at RT.</p><p>For the quantitative adipogenesis assay, cells were plated in 96-well plates at 100 cells/well and cultured as aforementioned for 2 weeks. The cells were then stained with Oil Red O and de-stained with isopropyl alchohol. The amount of Oil Red O was determined by measuring the OD of the solution at 520 nm. The results were then normalized to the protein contents of the samples.</p><p>For chondrogenesis, a pellet culture system was used as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Approximately 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>mMSCs (passage 8 or lower) were placed in a 15-mL polypropylene tube (Falcon, Bedford, MA), and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was cultured at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in 500 &#x003bc;L chondrogenic media that contained 500 ng/mL bone morphogenic protein-6 (BMP-6; R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in addition to high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10 ng/mL transforming growth factor-3 (TGF-&#x003b2;3; R&#x00026;D Systems), 10<sup>-7 </sup>M dexamethasone (Sigma), 50 &#x003bc;g/mL ascorbate-2-phosphate (Sigma), 40 &#x003bc;g/mL proline (Sigma), 100 &#x003bc;g/mL pyruvate (Sigma), and 50 mg/mL ITS+ Premix (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA; 6.25 &#x003bc;g/mL insulin, 6.25 &#x003bc;g/mL transferrin, 6.25 ng/mL selenious acid, 1.25 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, and 5.35 mg/mL linoleic acid). The medium was replaced every 3 to 4 days for 21 days. For microscopy, the pellets were embedded in paraffin, cut into 5 &#x003bc;m thick sections and stained with Toluidine Blue Sodium Borate (Sigma).</p></sec><sec><title>FACS analysis</title><p>Cells (passage 9 or lower) were trypsinized, collected, washed with PBS, and incubated for 1 hour at 4&#x000b0;C with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibodies against Sca-1 (Beckton Dickinson [BD]), CD34 (eBiosciences), CD106 (vascular adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1]) (Abcam), CD11b (BD), CD45 (BD), IgG2&#x003b1; (BD), IgG2&#x003b2; (BD), or IgG1 (Chemicon). Excess antibody was removed by washing cells with PBS, and cells were fixed in 1% para-formaldehyde. Detection of PE labeling was performed on a FACScalibur cytometer (BD, San Jose, USA), and results were analyzed using FlowJo software.</p></sec><sec><title>Examination of Growth Rates</title><p>Cells (passage 9 or lower) were plated at 100 cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>in a 56.7 cm<sup>2 </sup>culture dish in triplicate in CEM and cultured for 12 days. The media was changed every 3 days, and cells were trypsinized and pelleted every 3 days to analyze fold increase in density with a hemacytometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Colony Forming Unit Assay</title><p>In order to perform a colony forming unit (CFU) assay, cells (passage 9 or lower) were plated at a density of 100 cells in a 56.7 cm<sup>2 </sup>culture dish (1.76 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>). The cells were cultured for 14 days with fresh media added after 7 days. The plates were then washed with PBS and stained with 3% Crystal Violet at room temperature for 30 minutes. All colonies greater than 2 mm in diameter were counted. The CFU assay was performed in triplicate for each donor from three different frozen vials of cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CR performed all experiments under the supervision of BB.
