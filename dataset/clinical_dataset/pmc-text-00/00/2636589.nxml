The detection of hydrogen peroxide <italic>in vivo</italic> is challenging because of low reactivity and low concentration. The imaging of hydrogen peroxide <italic>in vivo</italic> was recently accomplished using a new family of nanoparticles, termed peroxalate nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijn-3-471">Lee et al 2007</xref>). The peroxalate nanoparticles are composed of polymeric peroxalate esters and fluorescent dyes, and detect hydrogen peroxide via a three component chemiluminescent reaction between a peroxalate ester, hydrogen peroxide and a fluorescent dye. Peroxalate nanoparticles had a mean size of 550 nm and exhibited excellent sensitivity and specificity to hydrogen peroxide. They were also capable of imaging hydrogen peroxide generated in the peritoneal cavity of mice during inflammation, after a direct intraperitoneal injection. However, desptite their great potential, these peroxalate nanoparticles are unsuitable for intravenous applications because their large size will prevent their extravasation into tissues, and their hydrophobic surface will promote clearance by the reticular endothelial system (RES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijn-3-471">Allen and Cullis 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijn-3-471">Peer et al 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we present a new hydrogen peroxide contrast agent, termed peroxalate micelles, which have the physicochemical properties needed for intravenous injections. The peroxalate micelles are composed of peroxalate containing amphiphilic polynorbornene copolymers and fluorescent dyes. Amphiphilic polynorbornene copolymers were synthesized via ring opening metathesis polymerization and self-assembled with fluorescent dyes, generating peroxalate micelles, which have a mean size of 33 nm and a &#x02018;stealth&#x02019; polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating to enhance their circulation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijn-3-471">Torchilin 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijn-3-471">Allen and Cullis 2004</xref>). Similar to the peroxalate nanoparticles, the peroxalate micelles image hydrogen peroxide by undergoing a three component chemiluminescent reaction, catalyzed by hydrogen peroxide, which results in the emission of photons and, therefore, the detection of hydrogen peroxide. The small size and nanomolar sensitivity (&#x0003e;50 nM) of the peroxlate micelles make them potentially useful for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of hydrogen peroxide.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>5-Norbornene-2-methanol, oxalic chloride, 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid, monomethoxy PEG (Mn = 2,000) and Grubbs catalyst (1st generation) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (MO.

However, the application of peroxalate chemiluminescence for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of hydrogen peroxide is challenging because it requires sequestering fluorescent dyes and peroxalate esters within close proximity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Peroxalate micelles are designed to sequester peroxalate esters and fluorescent dyes in their core, enabling the three component peroxalate chemiluminescent reaction to occur in response to hydrogen peroxide. The peroxalate micelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-3-471">Figure 1</xref>) are composed of the amphiphilic polynorbornene copolymer <bold>3</bold> and rubrene, which was chosen as a fluorescent dye because of its high fluorescence quantum efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijn-3-471">Stevani et al 2000</xref>).</p><p>The copolymer <bold>3</bold> is composed of a hydrophobic polynorbornene backbone, which has peroxalate esters and PEG chains grafted to it. This amphilic graft copolymer is designed to self-assemble, in aqueous solutions, with hydrophobic fluorescent dyes, such as rubrene, generating micelles that have peroxalate esters and fluorescent dyes in their hydrophobic core and a PEG corona. The peroxalate micelles detect hydrogen peroxide through a two-step chemiluminescent process, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-3-471">Figure 1</xref>. First, hydrogen peroxide diffuses into the core of the micelles and reacts with peroxalate esters, immediately generating a high energy dioxetanedione intermediate, which then chemically excites encapsulated fluorescent dyes, through a CIEEL (chemically initiated electron exchange luminescence) mechanism, leading to photon emission and the detection of hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijn-3-471">Matsumoto 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijn-3-471">Koike et al 2006</xref>). One of unique features of the peroxalate micelles is their specificity to hydrogen peroxide. This is because peroxalae chemiluminescence requires the generation of a dioxetanedione intermediate, which can be formed only by hydrogen peroxide, and not by other reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijn-3-471">Lee et al 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Synthesis of amphiphilic polynorbornene copolymers</title><p>A major challenge in developing contrast agents based on peroxalate chemiluminescence is a lack of synthetic techniques for generating polymeric peroxalate esters. The only current methodology for the synthesis of linear polymeric peroxalate esters is through the reaction of oxalyl chloride with diols. However, this polymerization method is not suitable for the development of amphiphilic block copolymers that have well-defined structures. In this study, ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) was employed as a new route for the synthesis of amphiphilic peroxalate copolymers. A ROMP-based synthetic strategy was chosen because ROMP is an efficient and powerful method to synthesize amphiphilic copolymers which have a well-defined structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijn-3-471">Stubenrauch et al 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijn-3-471">Feng et al 2002</xref>). In addition, peroxalate esters which are unstable in the presence of nucleophiles and water can tolerate ROMP reaction conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-3-471">Scheme 1</xref>).</p><p>The copolymer <bold>3</bold> was synthesized via ROMP of the monomers <bold>1</bold> and <bold>2</bold> and had a molecular weight of 38,000 (PDI = 1.5). The ROMP monomer, bicyclo [2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-ylmethyl phenyl oxalate (<bold>1</bold>) was designed as the peroxalate ester component of the micelles and was prepared in 40% yield from the reaction of norbornene-methanol, phenol, and oxalyl chloride. <bold>1</bold> is a mixed peroxalate ester, containing an aromatic and an aliphatic peroxalate ester. A mixed peroxalate ester was chosen as the hydrogen peroxide sensing moiety of <bold>1</bold> because of its straightforward synthesis and potential higher stability in aqueous solutions. The hydrophilic component of the peroxalate micelles was generated from the macromonomer &#x003b1;-norbornenylpoly(ethyleneglycol), <bold>2</bold>, which was synthesized from a reaction of 5-norbornene-2-carboxylic acid and monomethoxy PEG (Heroquez et al 1996; Heroquez et al 1997). Norbornenylp oly(ethyleneglycol) macromonomers have been used previously to synthesize amphiphilic branched copolymers that self-assemble into micelles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijn-3-471">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The vast majority of peroxalate esters used for peroxalate chemiluminescence are based on aromatic peroxalate esters such as diphenyl oxalate and trichlorophenyl oxalate. These phenolic based peroxalate esters react exceptionally well with hydrogen peroxide because of their low pKas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijn-3-471">Rauhut 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijn-3-471">Hadd et al 1999</xref>). The peroxalate ester used in this study is a mixed peroxalate ester (<bold>1</bold>) containing both an aromatic group and an aliphatic group, which has not been commonly investigated for peroxalate chemiluminescence. A potential limitation of using <bold>1</bold> for peroxalate chemiluminescence is its lower reactivity to hydrogen peroxide in comparison to aromatic peroxalate esters such as diphenyl oxalate, due to the higher pKa of aliphatic alcohols. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of <bold>1</bold> to hydrogen peroxide, we investigated the chemiluminescence quantum yield of <bold>1</bold> and compared it to diphenyl oxalate. The quantum efficiency of <bold>1</bold> and diphenyl oxalate was obtained at a concentration of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M with a large excess of rubrene. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijn-3-471">Table 1</xref> demonstrates, under these experimental conditions, the quantum efficiency of <bold>1</bold> is comparable to that of diphenyl oxalate, suggesting that <bold>1</bold> has potential for hydrogen peroxide detection.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of peroxalate micelles</title><p>The peroxalate micelles were formulated from the copolymer <bold>3</bold> via a solvent displacement method. The solvent displacement method was chosen for micelle formation because it has been extensively used to generate micelles in the range of 20~50 nm in diameter. Micelles of this size are particularly useful in biological applications because of their long circulation time in the blood and great potential for extravasation into tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijn-3-471">Gao et al 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijn-3-471">Nasongkla et al 2006</xref>). The copolymer <bold>3</bold> (20 mg) and fluorescent dye rubrene (1 mg) were dissolved in acetone, followed by mixing with a large volume of water, generating micelles that had a mean size of 33 nm in diameter, as determined by dynamic light scattering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-3-471">Figure 2a</xref>). The chemiluminescent emission spectrum of the micelles was obtained in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (10 &#x003bc;M). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-3-471">Figure 2b</xref> demonstrates that hydrogen peroxide initiates peroxalate chemiluminescence within the micelles, leading to photon emission at 560 nm, which is similar to the fluorescence emission wavelength of rubrene.</p></sec><sec><title>Sensitivity of the peroxalate micelles to hydrogen peroxide</title><p>The ability of the peroxalate micelles to detect hydrogen peroxide was investigated by measuring their chemiluminescence intensity in the presence of hydrogen peroxide at various concentrations in the range of 0&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;M. The intracellular concentration of hydrogen peroxide appears to be in the range of 1 nM to 700 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijn-3-471">Stone 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijn-3-471">Miller et al 2005</xref>). The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-3-471">Figure 3</xref> demonstrates that the peroxalate micelles have excellent sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and exhibit a linear correlation between chemiluminescence intensity and hydrogen peroxide concentration. The peroxalate micelles were capable of detecting hydrogen peroxide at concentrations as low as 50 nM (18603 RLU/s at 50 nM vs 252 RLU/s at 0 nM), suggesting great potential for the detection of hydrogen peroxide at physiological concentrations. The half-life of peroxalate chemiluminescence was approximately 1.5 min in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Interestingly, the peroxalate micelles have a sensitivity for hydrogen peroxide that is 5-fold greater than the larger peroxalate nanoparticles (50 nM vs 250 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijn-3-471">Lee et al 2007</xref>). We speculate that the enhanced sensitivity of the peroxalate micelles is partially due to their smaller size and higher surface area, which should enhance the diffusion of hydrogen peroxide into the micelles.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this report, we present a new contrast agent for hydrogen peroxide, termed peroxalate micelles, which are composed of amphiphilic peroxalate copolymers and rubrene.

The peroxalate micelles have a mean diameter of 33 nm and were capable of detecting hydrogen peroxide at concentrations as low as 50 nM. Peroxalate micelles have great potential for imaging of hydrogen peroxide <italic>in vivo</italic>, given their physicochemical properties and nanomolar
