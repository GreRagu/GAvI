After adjustment for a lead time of 2.4 years and for the increased use of hormone replacement therapy, they found 39&#x00025; excess.</p><p>We have reservations about adjustments for lead time (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Zahl <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Correction for lead time should only be done for those cancers that would have been diagnosed at a later time in the absence of screening. But many screen-detected cancers would not have come to the women's attention in their remaining lifetime, if they had not attended screening and are by definition overdiagnosed. If these cancers are not excluded from the calculation of lead time, the lead-time distribution will be artificially right-skewed, and the average lead time will appear to be much longer than it really is. <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Duffy <italic>et al</italic>, (2008)</xref> did not exclude such cancers from the calculation of lead time, but counted all excess cancers detected in a randomised trial as advanced diagnoses, when some of them were in fact overdiagnosed cases. They have therefore overestimated the lead-time effect.</p><p><xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Duffy <italic>et al</italic> (2008)</xref> recognise that the detection of non-overdiagnosed cancers should give rise to a drop in incidence when the women leave the screening programme. Quantifying such a compensatory drop is a less bias-prone method for adjusting the incidence increase for lead-time effects, as it makes no assumption about the average lead time. It is also very simple to use (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib6">Zahl <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>We have done a systematic review of incidence trends in countries with organised mammography screening that presented data on breast cancer incidence for both screened and non-screened age groups for at least 7 years before screening and 7 years after screening had been fully implemented (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">J&#x000f8;rgensen and G&#x000f8;tzsche, 2008</xref>). We were able to include data from United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Sweden and Norway. We found that compensatory drops in the older age groups were small or absent, although major drops would have been expected if the lead time of 2.4 years were true. When we adjusted for these drops, we found 36&#x00025; overdiagnosis of invasive breast cancer, in good agreement with the results of <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Duffy <italic>et al</italic> (2008)</xref>, and 51&#x00025; when we included carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Duffy <italic>et al</italic> (2008)</xref> mention that after prolonged follow-up of the Malm&#x000f6; randomised screening trial, an overdiagnosis of 7&#x02013;8&#x00025; was reported and they find this estimate considerably more plausible than their own estimate of 39&#x00025;. However, they have overlooked that the former estimate is seriously flawed (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Zahl <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). There was substantial opportunistic screening in the control group and after adjustment for this, the overdiagnosis estimate in the Malm&#x000f6; trial is 24&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib2">G&#x000f8;tzsche and J&#x000f8;rgensen, 2006</xref>).</p><p>It is asserted that after adjustments, overdiagnosis estimates will be smaller than many rates quoted in the past (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib1">Duffy <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). We disagree, as most &#x02018;rates quoted in the past' have been too small (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">G&#x000f8;tzsche and Nielsen, 2006</xref>). On the basis of randomised trials, the overdiagnosis is 30&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib3">G&#x000f8;tzsche and Nielsen, 2006</xref>), and it becomes 44&#x00025; if adjusted for opportunistic screening in the control groups (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">J&#x000f8;rgensen and G&#x000f8;tzsche, 2008</xref>). The low rates in the past have been too low for the very reason that they have been based on flawed lead-time models (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">J&#x000f8;rgensen and G&#x000f8;tzsche, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="bib5">Zahl <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). We believe the most reliable estimate for organised mammography screening is 51&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="other" rid="bib4">J&#x000f8;rgensen and G&#x000f8;tzsche, 2008</xref>). This means that one in three breast cancers detected in a population offered organised mammography screening are overdiagnosed. Many women are therefore harmed substantially by screening, as practically all detected carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> cases and invasive cancers are treated, at great physical and psychological costs.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Duffy</surname><given-names>SW</given-names></name><name><surname>Lynge</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Jonsson</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ayyaz</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Olsen</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Complexities in the estimation of overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening</article-title><source>Br J Cancer</source><year>2008</year><volume>99</volume><fpage>557</fpage><lpage>562</lpage><!--PubMed citation query: 'Br J Cancer||99|557||bib1|'--><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18665179</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><citation citation-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>G&#x000f8;tzsche</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name><name><surname>J&#x000f8;rgensen</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Estimate of harm/benefit ratio of mammography screening was five times too optimistic</article-title><year>2006</year></citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><citation citation-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>G&#x000f8;tzsche</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Screening for breast cancer with mammography</article-title><source>Cochrane Database Syst Rev</source><year>2006</year><supplement>Issue 4</supplement><fpage>CD001877</fpage></citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><citation citation-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>J&#x000f8;rgensen</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name><name><surname>G&#x000f8;tzsche</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Overdiagnosis in publicly organised mammography screening programmes: systematic review of incidence trends</article-title><source>BMJ</source><year>2008</year>(in press)</citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zahl</surname><given-names>PH</given-names></name><name><surname>J&#x000f8;rgensen</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name><name><surname>M&#x000e6;hlen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>G&#x000f8;tzsche</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Biases in published estimates of overdetection due to screening with mammography</article-title><source>Lancet Oncol</source><year>2008</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>199</fpage><lpage>201</lpage><!--PubMed citation query: 'Lancet Oncol||9|199||bib5|'--><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18308246</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="bib6"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zahl</surname><given-names>PH</given-names></name><name><surname>Strand</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name><name><surname>M&#x000e6;hlen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Breast cancer incidence in Norway and Sweden during introduction of nation-wide screening: prospective cohort study</article-title><source>BMJ</source><year>2004</year><volume>328</volume><fpage>921</fpage><lpage>924</lpage><!--PubMed citation query: 'BMJ||328|921||bib6|'--></citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
