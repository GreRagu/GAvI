This pathway is characterized by the generation of an enzymatically active, transient intermediate, meizothrombin, that has increased chromogenic substrate activity but poor clotting activity. The heavy chain of factor Va contains an acidic region at the COOH terminus (residues 680&#x02212;709). We have shown that a pentapeptide from this region (DYDYQ) inhibits prothrombin activation by prothrombinase by inhibiting meizothrombin generation. To ascertain the function of these regions, we have created a mutant recombinant factor V molecule that is missing the last 30 amino acids from the heavy chain (factor V<sup>&#x00394;680&#x02212;709</sup>) and a mutant molecule with the <sup>695</sup>DYDY<sup>698</sup> &#x02192; AAAA substitutions (factor V<sup>4A</sup>). The clotting activities of both recombinant mutant factor Va molecules were impaired compared to the clotting activity of wild-type factor Va (factor Va<sup>Wt</sup>). Using an assay employing purified reagents, we found that prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sup>&#x00394;680&#x02212;709</sup> displayed an &#x0223c;39% increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>, while prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sup>4A</sup> exhibited an &#x0223c;20% increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for the activation of prothrombin as compared to prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sup>Wt</sup>. Gel electrophoresis analyzing prothrombin activation by prothrombinase assembled with the mutant molecules revealed a delay in prothrombin activation with persistence of meizothrombin. Our data demonstrate that the COOH-terminal region of factor Va heavy chain is indeed crucial for coordinated prothrombin activation by prothrombinase because it regulates meizothrombin cleavage at Arg<sup>271</sup> and suggest that this portion of factor Va is partially responsible for the enhanced procoagulant function of prothrombinase.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi800593k</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2008-00593k</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Blood coagulation is initiated at the site of vascular injury and results in the activation of prothrombin to &#x003b1;-thrombin by the prothrombinase complex. Prothrombinase is composed of the enzyme factor Xa bound to its cofactor, factor Va, on a phospholipid surface in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). Prothrombin and &#x003b1;-thrombin have two distinct exosites (anion binding exosite I, ABE-I,<xref rid="fn4" ref-type="fn">1</xref> and anion binding exosite II, ABE-II) that are responsible for the functions of the molecules. The role of (pro)exosite I of prothrombin within prothrombinase is dependent on the incorporation of factor Va into the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Two pathways for prothrombin activation are possible: membrane-bound factor Xa alone activates prothrombin following initial cleavage at Arg<sup>271</sup> followed by cleavage at Arg<sup>320</sup>, while the fully assembled prothrombinase complex activates prothrombin following the opposite pathway, initial cleavage at Arg<sup>320</sup> followed by cleavage at Arg<sup>271</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup>. Activation of prothrombin via this latter pathway is characterized by the generation of an intermediate, meizothrombin, that has proteolytic activity and results in a significant increase in the catalytic efficiency of factor Xa with respect to &#x003b1;-thrombin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>).<fn id="fn4"><label>1</label><p>Abbreviations: PS, <sc>l</sc>-&#x003b1;-phosphatidylserine; PC, <sc>l</sc>-&#x003b1;-phosphatidylcholine; PCPS vesicles, small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles composed of 75% PC and 25% PS (w/w); SDS&#x02212;PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate&#x02212;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; ABE-I, anion binding exosite I; ABE-II, anion binding exosite II; DYDYQ, pentapeptide from factor Va heavy chain with the sequence Asp<sup>695</sup>-Tyr<sup>696</sup>-Asp<sup>697</sup>-Tyr<sup>698</sup>-Gln<sup>699</sup>; factor V<sup>Wt</sup>, wild-type recombinant human factor V; factor Va<sub>IIa</sub><sup>Wt</sup>, wild-type recombinant human factor V activated with &#x003b1;-thrombin; factor Va<sub>RVV</sub><sup>Wt</sup>, wild-type recombinant human factor V activated with RVV-V activator; factor V<sup>&#x00394;680&#x02212;709</sup>, recombinant human factor V missing amino acid residues 680&#x02212;709; factor Va<sub>RVV</sub><sup>&#x00394;680&#x02212;709</sup>, recombinant human factor V missing amino acid residues 680&#x02212;709 activated with RVV-V activator; factor V<sup>4A</sup>, recombinant human factor V with the <sup>695</sup>DYDY<sup>698</sup> &#x02192; AAAA mutations; factor Va<sub>IIa</sub><sup>4A</sup>, recombinant human factor V with the <sup>695</sup>DYDY<sup>698</sup> &#x02192; AAAA mutations activated with &#x003b1;-thrombin; factor Va<sub>RVV</sub><sup>4A</sup>, recombinant human factor V with the <sup>695</sup>DYDY<sup>698</sup> &#x02192; AAAA mutations activated with RVV-V activator; factor V<sub>IIa</sub><sup>PLASMA</sup>, plasma-derived human factor V activated with &#x003b1;-thrombin; factor Va<sub>RVV</sub><sup>PLASMA</sup>, plasma-derived human factor V activated with RVV-V activator; factor Va<sub>IIa/CG</sub>, plasma-derived factor V activated with &#x003b1;-thrombin and treated with cathepsin G; factor Va<sub>IIa/NN</sub>, plasma-derived factor V activated with &#x003b1;-thrombin and treated with the purified enzyme from the venom of the snake <italic>Naja nigricollis nigricollis</italic>.</p></fn></p><p>Human factor V circulates in plasma as a 330000 molecular weight, single-chain protein that consists of three domains in the order A1&#x02212;A2&#x02212;B&#x02212;A3&#x02212;C1&#x02212;C2. Proteolytic cleavage of the cofactor by &#x003b1;-thrombin occurs sequentially at Arg<sup>709</sup>, Arg<sup>1018</sup>, and Arg<sup>1545</sup> to produce a heterodimer consisting of a heavy chain (<italic>M</italic><sub>r</sub> &#x0223c; 105000) and a light chain (<italic>M</italic><sub>r</sub> &#x0223c; 74000) associated via divalent metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The heavy chain of the cofactor contains an acidic amino acid region that has been shown to be important for cofactor function (amino acids 680&#x02212;709) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Earlier data have suggested that factor Va interacts with meizothrombin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) and that this acidic region is implicated in the productive interaction of factor Va with prothrombin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). Various proteases can cleave this acidic region to produce a cofactor with a truncated heavy chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Gerads et al. first showed that it is possible to selectively eliminate the acidic region from factor Va heavy chain by an enzyme purified from the venom of the snake <italic>Naja naja oxiana</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Using proteins of bovine origin, the authors demonstrated that while elimination of the COOH-terminal region of factor Va results in a molecule with severely impaired clotting activity, incorporation of the truncated cofactor molecule into prothrombinase resulted in an increased <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for the activation of prothrombin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). The same authors also showed that cleavage of the human factor Va heavy chain by the same enzyme results in a cofactor with impaired clotting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). Subsequently, Bakker et al. using the same purified enzyme identified the cleavage site of the enzyme at His<sup>682</sup> in the human factor Va heavy chain [this amino acid is conserved in the bovine cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>)] and demonstrated that prothrombinase assembled with a human factor Va molecule missing the Asp<sup>683</sup>&#x02212;Arg<sup>709</sup> portion has an increased <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for the activation of prothrombin as compared to the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of prothrombinase assembled with the plasma cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Afterward, Camire et al. using cathepsin G (CG) and human neutrophil elastase demonstrated that prothrombinase assembled with factor Va molecules missing the COOH-terminal domain of the heavy chain results in enzymes that consistently express higher <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values, suggesting that these molecules are &#x0201c;more active&#x0201d; cofactors than purified plasma factor Va activated with &#x003b1;-thrombin in an assay using purified reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). Surprisingly, and in line with the initial findings of Gerads et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>), the same factor Va molecules exhibited a significant decrease in clotting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). More recently, using a purified enzyme from the snake venom of <italic>Naja nigricollis nigricollis</italic>, we have also shown that a factor Va molecule missing a portion of the COOH terminus of the heavy chain has decreased clotting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Altogether, these studies reveal that removal of the acidic COOH-terminal portion of factor Va heavy chain results in a cofactor molecule that is deficient in its clotting activity. However, prothrombinase assembled with these truncated cofactor molecules produces significantly higher <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values for prothrombin activation when assessed in assays using purified reagents and a chromogenic substrate specific for &#x003b1;-thrombin. A molecular explanation for these paradoxical observations has not yet been provided.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Mutants of human factor V.

This increase in the esterase activity of &#x003b1;-thrombin was concomitant with a decrease in its clotting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Subsequently, Franza et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), Morita et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>), and Kornalik and Blomb&#x000e4;ck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) reported that meizothrombin (and meizothrombin desfragment 1) generated by a component purified from the venom of <italic>Echis carinatus</italic> has poor clotting activity and high esterolytic activity toward TAME. Franza et al. specifically demonstrated that the meizothrombin species generated by <italic>E. carinatus</italic> has esterolytic activity toward TAME &#x0223c;30% higher than that of &#x003b1;-thrombin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Concomitantly, Myrmel et al. provided concrete evidence demonstrating that addition of fragment 2 to &#x003b1;-thrombin increases significantly the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme toward TAME, compared to the efficiency of &#x003b1;-thrombin alone against the same substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). All these findings were later corroborated by two independent studies using either TAME or S-2238 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>), and it was hypothesized that there may be subtle but significant differences between the active sites of &#x003b1;-thrombin and meizothrombin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). This conclusion was strengthened by earlier findings demonstrating that while DAPA, a specific noncovalent active site inhibitor of &#x003b1;-thrombin, interacts with prethrombin 2 with an affinity that is &#x0223c;30 times lower than that for &#x003b1;-thrombin, the inhibitor does not bind prothrombin and prethrombin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>), and by data obtained using electron spin resonance to probe the active sites of meizothrombin and &#x003b1;-thrombin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). Collectively, the findings suggest an important effect of cleavage at Arg<sup>271</sup> on the progressive formation of the active site of &#x003b1;-thrombin, resulting in significant conformational differences between the active sites of &#x003b1;-thrombin and meizothrombin. More recently, structural data obtained from the only crystal structure of meizothrombin available in the literature [bovine meizothrombin desfragment 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>)] have established that the molecule is impaired in its clotting activity because it has not yet exposed ABE-II (which is covered by fragment 2). However, it is important to note that comparison of the structural data of various &#x003b1;-thrombin molecules provided in the literature with the crystal structure of meizothrombin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>) does not allow for a definite conclusion about the differences between the active site conformations of the two enzymes.</p><p>We have recently used overlapping peptides from region 680&#x02212;709 of the factor Va molecule to show that an acidic pentapeptide with the sequence DYDYQ inhibits prothrombin activation by prothrombinase in a competitive manner with respect to substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). We have further demonstrated that DYDYQ inhibits prothrombinase activity by inhibiting meizothrombin generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). Using data obtained with recombinant proteins, Toso and Camire have recently suggested that the COOH-terminal region of the factor Va heavy chain has no detectable effect on prothrombinase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). This conclusion was surprising and inconsistent with their findings since their data showed that (1) prothrombinase assembled with recombinant factor Va molecules missing a portion or the entire hirudin-like carboxyl-terminal end of the heavy chain (amino acid residues 678&#x02013;709) had an increased <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for the activation of prothrombin (from 129 to 150%) compared to prothrombinase assembled with the wild-type molecule in an assay using purified reagents and a chromogenic substrate specific for &#x003b1;-thrombin; (2) initial velocity measurements using the same assay demonstrated a 20&#x02212;25% increase in the rate of &#x003b1;-thrombin formation by prothrombinase assembled with the same recombinant mutant cofactor molecules that were truncated at their carboxyl-terminal end; and (3) a recombinant factor Va molecule that is missing 17 amino acids from the carboxy-terminal portion of the heavy chain had decreased clotting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). All these data are in complete accord with all earlier findings using plasma-derived factor Va molecules truncated at the carboxy-terminal end of their heavy chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) and demonstrate a crucial but yet undetermined contribution of the acidic COOH-terminal region of the heavy chain of the cofactor to prothrombinase activity during prothrombin activation.</p><p>It has been well established that while meizothrombin has poor clotting activity, its amidolytic activity is increased compared to that of &#x003b1;-thrombin toward small fluorescent and chromogenic substrates specifically used to assess &#x003b1;-thrombin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). A logical hypothesis for reconciling all the findings described above is that the acidic COOH terminus of factor Va heavy chain, and more precisely the sequence DYDYQ, regulates meizothrombin concentration during the factor Xa-catalyzed prothrombin activation by prothrombinase. Thus, activation of prothrombin by prothrombinase assembled with a cofactor that is missing the acidic region will result in enhanced and stable meizothrombin production. This result will be translated by a factor Va molecule that is deficient in its clotting activity but produces an increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> when introduced into prothrombinase. In contrast, in the presence of an excess of the acidic region [represented by DYDYQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>)], no meizothrombin is produced by prothrombinase, resulting in the generation of &#x003b1;-thrombin through the alternative pathway characterized by initial cleavage of prothrombin at Arg<sup>271</sup> and transient formation of prethrombin 2. This work was undertaken to test these hypotheses and to elucidate the role of the acidic COOH-terminal portion of the factor Va heavy chain during activation of prothrombin by prothrombinase.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Materials, Reagents, and Proteins</title><p>Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), <italic>O</italic>-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD), <italic>N</italic>-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-<italic>N</italic>&#x02032;-2-ethanesulfonic acid (Hepes), Trizma (Tris base), and Coomassie Blue R-250 were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Under the conditions that were employed, prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sub>RVV</sub><sup>Wt</sup> activates prothrombin quickly, with meizothrombin as a short-lived intermediate as demonstrated by the brief half-life of fragment 1&#x000b7;2-A (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Scanning densitometry demonstrated a peak of meizothrombin early in the reaction at 80 s, and no meizothrombin was detected following 180 s (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). In contrast, in the presence of prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sup>&#x00394;680&#x02212;709</sup>, prothrombin is consumed with a rate that is approximately 3-fold slower than the rate of consumption of prothrombin by prothrombinase assembled with the wild-type molecule (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), with persistence of meizothrombin as indicated by the lingering of fragment 1&#x000b7;2-A even at the late time points of the reaction (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Scanning densitometry demonstrated a peak of meizothrombin late in the reaction at 250 s. Meizothrombin was more concentrated and persisted for up to 6 min (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). In addition, the rate of appearance of the B chain is also delayed (by approximately 3-fold) when prothrombin is activated by prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sup>&#x00394;680&#x02212;709</sup>, compared with the rate of appearance of the B chain obtained following incubation of prothrombin with prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sub>RVV</sub><sup>Wt</sup>. Similar results were obtained with factor Va<sub>IIa/CG</sub> (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of DYDYQ, no meizothrombin is observed following prothrombin activation by prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sup>&#x00394;680&#x02212;709</sup>, and &#x003b1;-thrombin is formed through the alternate pathway characterized by initial cleavage at Arg<sup>271</sup> and formation of prethrombin 2 as the intermediate (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Overall, the data demonstrate that elimination of amino acid region 680&#x02212;709 from factor Va results in a cofactor molecule that when incorporated into prothrombinase produces an enzyme responsible for both delayed prothrombin activation and persistence of meizothrombin during activation of prothrombin.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Reaction profiles for the activation of prothrombin by prothrombinase. Progress curves for products and reactants for the activation of prothrombin by prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sup>Wt</sup> (A) or factor Va<sup>&#x00394;680&#x02212;709</sup> (B) were obtained by quantitative scanning densitometry of gels shown in panels A and B of Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, as described in <xref rid="sec2"/>.

To understand the properties of this molecule and the effect of the mutations on cofactor activity, we used the same preparation of recombinant protein to perform three different experiments. Factor V<sup>4A</sup> was first activated with &#x003b1;-thrombin, and the solution was split into three separate samples. One sample was used for assessment of clotting activity, one sample was used to measure the kinetic parameters of prothrombinase assembled with a saturating concentration of factor Va<sub>IIa</sub><sup>4A</sup>, and the third sample was used for analysis of prothrombin activation by gel electrophoresis. The results reveal that while factor Va<sub>IIa</sub><sup>4A</sup> is severely impaired in its clotting activity (&#x0223c;22% of that of factor Va<sub>IIa</sub><sup>Wt</sup>), prothrombinase assembled with the mutant molecule shows a 19.7% increased <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Gel electrophoresis followed by scanning densitometry analysis demonstrated that prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sub>IIa</sub><sup>4A</sup> cleaves prothrombin with a rate that is approximately 3.8-fold slower than the rate of cleavage of prothrombin assembled with factor Va<sub>IIa</sub><sup>Wt</sup> or factor Va<sub>IIa</sub><sup>PLASMA</sup> (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D,E and Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Scanning densitometry of several gels studying prothrombin activation by prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sub>IIa</sub><sup>4A</sup> revealed a peak of meizothrombin at approximately 240 s with significant amounts of meizothrombin remaining for up to 10 min (not shown). The data also showed more meizothrombin formed and delayed B chain formation by prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sup>4A</sup> as compared to the levels of meizothrombin produced by prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sup>Wt</sup>. Similar data were obtained with factor Va<sub>RVV</sub><sup>4A</sup> (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). These findings strongly support our previous conclusion suggesting that amino acid sequence 695&#x02212;699 regulates meizothrombin formation by prothrombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). These data also demonstrate that, in the presence of prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sup>4A</sup>, the excess meizothrombin formed as assessed functionally by clotting assays can compensate for the absence of &#x003b1;-thrombin in the assay using purified reagents because the increased amidolytic activity of meizothrombin toward the chromogenic substrate is read as &#x003b1;-thrombin activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Role of the Acidic COOH-Terminal Portion of the Factor Va Heavy Chain: A Potential Mechanism</title><p>The data obtained thus far studying plasma-derived prothrombin activation by prothrombinase assembled with the mutant cofactor molecules suggest that meizothrombin formation is not greatly delayed but rather that meizothrombin accumulates to higher and more persistent levels and lingers throughout the time course (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). The appearance of the B chain of &#x003b1;-thrombin is also delayed when prothrombin is activated by prothrombinase assembled with the mutant cofactor (Figures <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These data indicate that one or both of the two prothrombin activation cleavages are impaired (affected) when prothrombinase is assembled with a cofactor molecule missing the acidic COOH terminus of the heavy chain or with factor Va<sup>4A</sup>. To verify if under the conditions employed, cleavage at Arg<sup>320</sup> in prothrombin is delayed when prothrombinase is assembled with factor Va<sub>IIa</sub><sup>4A</sup> as compared to cleavage of prothrombin at the same site by prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sub>IIa</sub><sup>Wt</sup>, we studied prothrombin cleavage during the first 90 s of the reaction. Quantitative scanning densitometry of the gels revealed no differences in the rate of plasma-derived prothrombin consumption by prothrombinase assembled with either factor Va<sub>IIa</sub><sup>4A</sup> or factor Va<sup>Wt</sup> during this period of time (not shown). These data combined with the data shown in Figures <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> illustrating delayed prothrombin consumption which is accompanied by an increase in the concentration of meizothrombin (up to &#x0223c;20%) in the case of the activation of prothrombin by prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sup>&#x00394;680&#x02212;709</sup> as compared to the concentration of meizothrombin produced following activation of prothrombin by prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sup>Wt</sup> suggest that delayed initial cleavage at Arg<sup>320</sup> in plasma-derived prothrombin is not a direct consequence of the mutation in factor Va, but rather the result of product inhibition by the accumulating meizothrombin. This inhibition is observed only late in the reaction when sufficient meizothrombin accumulates, as clearly demonstrated by our combined results.</p><p>It is important to note that during the course of the assay using plasma-derived prothrombin we are measuring the sum of meizothrombin and &#x003b1;-thrombin. A more rigorous test to verify which cleavage in prothrombin is affected by the deletion at the COOH terminus of factor Va heavy chain involves the study of the activation of a prothrombin molecule that cannot be cleaved at Arg<sup>271</sup> such as rMZ-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). In addition, while cleavage of rMZ-II can be followed by gel electrophoresis, generation of rMZ-IIa can be also assessed with the chromogenic substrate used to assess &#x003b1;-thrombin formation. We thus followed activation of rMZ-II by prothrombinase assembled with either factor Va<sub>RVV</sub><sup>&#x00394;680&#x02212;709</sup> or factor Va<sub>RVV</sub><sup>Wt</sup> by gel electrophoresis (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A) and activity assays using Spectrozyme-TH (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). Both sets of data demonstrate that there are no significant differences between the rates of activation of rMZ-II by either enzyme. The rates of rMZ-II consumption were similar as determined by scanning densitometry of the gels depicted in Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, and the profiles of both titrations are coincident [similar <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> values and similar <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values of 91 &#x000b1; 9 and 121 &#x000b1; 18 &#x003bc;M (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B)]. Comparable results were found in three independent measurements using two different preparations of recombinant factor Va molecules and two separate preparations of rMZ-II. The data confirm our overall findings with plasma-derived prothrombin and demonstrate that prothrombinase-mediated cleavage at Arg<sup>320</sup> in prothrombin is not affected by the COOH-terminal portion of the factor Va heavy chain.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Analysis of the activation of rMZ-II.

We next compared the rate of cleavage of FPR-meizothrombin by prothrombinase assembled with various factor Va molecules (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

Altogether, these findings demonstrate that while the rate of the first cleavage in prothrombin (i.e., Arg<sup>320</sup>) is not significantly affected by the deletion of the COOH-terminal portion of the factor Va heavy chain, the rate of cleavage of meizothrombin at Arg<sup>271</sup> by prothrombinase appears to be regulated by the acidic hirudin-like COOH-terminal portion of the heavy chain. Our data show that prothrombinase assembled with factor Va<sup>PLASMA</sup> or factor Va<sup>Wt</sup> cleaves FPR-meizothrombin with a rate that is 4&#x02212;5-fold higher than the rate of cleavage of FPR-meizothrombin by factor Xa alone or by prothrombinase assembled with the mutant molecules. These findings are in complete accord with earlier data demonstrating that incorporation of factor Va into prothrombinase results in a 3&#x02212;5-fold increase in the rate of cleavage of meizothrombin at Arg<sup>271</sup> as compared to the rate of cleavage at the same site by factor Xa alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we have demonstrated that formation of meizothrombin by prothrombinase assembled with the plasma-derived cofactor is inhibited in the presence of low concentrations of an acidic region from the carboxyl-terminal portion of factor Va (represented by pentapeptide DYDYQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). The combined findings demonstrate that amino acid sequence 695&#x02212;698 is responsible for the regulation of meizothrombin processing and suggest that peptide DYDYQ inhibits meizothrombin generation by prothrombinase by accelerating the rate of cleavage at Arg<sup>271</sup> by the enzyme, thus practically alleviating the factor Va cofactor effect within prothrombinase. As a result, in the presence of DYDYQ, cleavage of prothrombin by prothrombinase becomes virtually independent of factor Va. These findings are in complete accord with our recent data demonstrating that DYDYQ significantly increases the rate of cleavage of prothrombin consumption by membrane-bound factor Xa alone because of acceleration of the cleavage at Arg<sup>271</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). Indeed, membrane-bound factor Xa/DYDYQ, in the absence of factor Va, cleaves prothrombin with a rate that is &#x0223c;5-fold slower than the rate of cleavage of prothrombin by prothrombinase (ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>) and Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), while membrane-bound factor Xa alone cleaves prothrombin with a rate that is &#x0223c;250-fold slower than the rate of cleavage of the substrate by prothrombinase. However, it is noteworthy that in the presence of an excess of DYDYQ, prothrombin cleavage by prothrombinase is significantly inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). Altogether, these findings warrant the need for further investigation of the mode of action and site of interaction with prothrombin of the pentapeptide as well as of the molecular mechanism of inhibition of prothrombinase by DYDYQ.</p><p>Blood clotting enzymes, with the exception of factor IX and prothrombin, are activated following single proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). It is thus assumed that results obtained following the activation of a zymogen either by gel electrophoresis or by assays that measure the generation of enzymatic activity with chromogenic substrates should be concordant. However, prothrombin activation is different from the activation of other zymogens because (1) prothrombin can be activated through two different pathways that have different requirements and significantly different rates and (2) activation of prothrombin through the meizothrombin pathway generates an intermediate that has higher amidolytic activity than &#x003b1;-thrombin toward chromogenic substrates that are commonly used to assess &#x003b1;-thrombin generation. Thus, while following prothrombin activation by both gel electrophoresis and activity assays simultaneously may appear to be a duplication of the same result, drawing conclusions from activity assays alone without analyzing the pathway to prothrombin activation and the intermediates formed is an oversimplification that can lead to erroneous conclusions.</p><p>Two assays are used worldwide for the determination of factor Va cofactor activity: a clotting assay using factor V-deficient plasma and a prothrombinase assay using purified reagents. The former assay is performed at low (limiting) concentrations of factor Va, while the latter assay is conducted with high (saturating) concentrations of factor Va with respect to factor Xa. Both assays indirectly report on factor Va cofactor activity through the activation of prothrombin to &#x003b1;-thrombin. The clotting time measures the level of fibrin formation in factor V-deficient plasma, while the prothrombinase assay measures &#x003b1;-thrombin&#x02019;s amidolytic activity as it is generated toward a chromogenic substrate. Initial cleavage of prothrombin at Arg<sup>320</sup> by prothrombinase, which is absolutely factor Va-dependent, results in rapid meizothrombin generation. However, depending on the ratio of meizothrombin to &#x003b1;-thrombin formed at the moment the measurement is taken, the results reflect the clotting or amidolytic activity of either &#x003b1;-thrombin or meizothrombin or the sum of both. Thus, if generation of &#x003b1;-thrombin is delayed compared to the formation of meizothrombin, the measurements will mostly reflect the properties of meizothrombin (i.e., impaired clotting and increased chromogenic activity).</p><p>Work performed independently in several laboratories worldwide has demonstrated that while elimination of the COOH-terminal acidic region of factor Va heavy chain results in a cofactor molecule with poor clotting activity (retaining 20&#x02212;40% of the clotting activity of normal factor Va), the same molecule as part of prothrombinase produces a substantial increase in the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of the enzyme in an assay using a chromogenic substrate to assess &#x003b1;-thrombin generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Similar results were recently obtained with recombinant factor Va molecules missing portions of the COOH terminus of the factor Va heavy chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). All these results could be partially explained if the truncated cofactor molecules had weakened binding capabilities for membrane-bound factor Xa. However, previously reported data demonstrated that all truncated factor Va molecules have <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values for factor Xa similar to that of the plasma-derived cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>), and recent experiments with recombinant factor Va molecules missing the entire hirudin-like COOH-terminal portion of the factor Va heavy chain (amino acids 679&#x02212;709, rFVa<sup>678</sup>) confirm our findings shown in Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A with factor Va<sup>&#x00394;680&#x02212;709</sup> and demonstrate that the recombinant mutant cofactor binds factor Xa with an affinity similar to that of the wild-type molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). Thus, while every study was remarkably consistent in showing poor clotting and increased <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for the same truncated factor Va molecules [up to &#x0223c;50% higher <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>) (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>)], no satisfactory explanation has been yet provided to explain this seeming paradox at best (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>), or at worst the observations were simply discarded as relatively modest changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). Our data, put in the context of the literature, provide a logical explanation for these observations and demonstrate that the acidic COOH-terminal portion of the factor Va heavy chain controls the rate of &#x003b1;-thrombin generation by factor Xa within prothrombinase by controlling the rate of meizothrombin cleavage at Arg<sup>271</sup>. Our findings are thus consistent with the interpretation that amino acid sequence <sup>695</sup>DYDY<sup>698</sup> of the heavy chain of the cofactor is a significant contributor to the macromolecular substrate recognition of prothrombin by prothrombinase.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Summary of Results Obtained with Factor Va Molecules Truncated at the COOH Terminus of the Heavy Chain in a Clotting Assay and in a Prothrombinase Assay</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border:none;" align="center">&#x000a0;</th><th style="border:none;" align="center">impaired clotting<xref rid="tbl2-fn1" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></th><th style="border:none;" align="center">increased <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub><xref rid="tbl2-fn2" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">Gerads et al.
