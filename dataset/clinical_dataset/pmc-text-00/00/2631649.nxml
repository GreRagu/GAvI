INTRODUCTION</title><p>Bacterial  vaginosis (BV) is the most frequent  vaginalinfectious disorder in women of childbearing age with prevalences ranging from10% to 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition to the physiological burden that induces BV, it can causeserious sequelae such as preterm birth and facilitate the acquisition ofsexually transmitted diseases. The cause of BV remains poorly understood, andno specific infectious agents have been identified. However, the disorder ischaracterized by modifications of the genital tract microflora, including areduction in or absence of lactobacillus colonization and overgrowth of severalanaerobic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The vaginal ecosystem in healthy premenopausal women harbors amicrobiota dominated by <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], that is, being increasingly recognized as protecting it from invadingpathogens, including those that cause urinary tract infections and sexuallytransmitted diseases. Different mechanisms are potentially involved in theactivity of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> againstpathogens, including the competitive exclusion of genitourinary pathogens fromreceptors present on the surface of the epithelial cells. Under healthyconditions, cervicovaginal cells are constantly exposed to the normal vaginalmicrobiota.</p><p>The recommended treatment regimens for vaginal infectionsare oral or intravaginal antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], but these conventional treatments are associated with frequentrecurrences. Alternative therapeutic agents need to be sought, and it has beensuggested that the administration of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> can restore ecological balance in the vagina by controlling the infectivity ofpathogenic microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], but the treatment is still a subject of debate. Several clinicaltrials have been performed to investigate the effects of specific strains,mainly with <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> and <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], but no definitive conclusions as to whether these probiotics representan effective and safe method for treating women with BV can be drawn. Thebehavior of the probiotics in the vaginal tract is likely to be strain specificand therefore, it is important to determine the characteristics of the strainto be used as a therapeutic agent. The most relevant properties in this contextare likely to be adhesion to cervicovaginal cells and adequate pathogen growthinhibition. In vitro studies assessing these properties might not be able tofully simulate the in vivo behavior, but they could be reliable indicators whenselecting the probiotic strain. The purpose of this study was to determine thein vitro adherence of a well characterized <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> probiotic strain, Lcr35 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and its ability to inhibit growth of three vaginosis-associatedpathogens. We used immortalized morphologically and functionally distinctepithelial cell lines from normal endocervix, ectocervix, and vagina tocharacterize Lcr35 epithelial interactions pertinent to the lower femalegenital tract and determined its antimicrobial activity against <italic>Prevotella bivia</italic>, <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, and <italic>Candidaalbicans</italic> in coculture experiments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="subsec2.1"><title>2.1. Adhesion assay</title><p>Adhesion assays were performed with epithelial cells fromnormal human vagina (VK2/E6E7 ATCC-CRL-2616), ectocervix (Ect1/E6E7ATCC-CRL-2614), and endocervix (End1/E6E7 ATCC-CRL-2615), immortalized byexpression of the E6 and E7 genes of human papillomavirus type 16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The morphological and immunocytochemical characteristics of theimmortalized lines closely resembled those of their tissues of origin andprimary cultures and are likely to represent the different compartments of thevaginal tract.</p><p>The cell lines were maintained in keratinocyte serum-freemedium (Gifco BRL 17005-042) supplemented with human recombinant EGF (0.1 ng/mL),bovine pituitary extract (0.05 mg/mL), and calcium chloride (0.4 mM) at 37&#x000b0;Cwith a 5%  CO<sub>2</sub> in air atmosphere.</p><p>Adhesion of the Lcr35 was assayed by seeding cell lines in24-well tissue culture plates at 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> epithelial cells/well andallowing them to grow to complete confluence (10<sup>5</sup> cells/well). After gentle washing of the cell monolayer,the adhesion capacity of Lcr35 was determined by adding 10<sup>5</sup> multiplicity of infection(MOI,1), 10<sup>6</sup> (MOI, 10), and 10<sup>7</sup> (MOI, 100) bacteria froman overnight culture in de Man, Rogosa, Sharpe (MRS) agar medium. Bacterial cells were previously washed inphosphate buffered saline and resuspended in the cell culture medium. Adhesionwas monitored after 1 and 3 hours of incubation carried out at 37&#x000b0;C under 5%  CO<sub>2</sub>. The monolayers were washed three times with 1 mL of Dulbecco's phosphatebuffered saline, detached by addition of 0.1% TritonX-100 solution and the numberof viable bacteria determined by plating serial dilutions of the suspensionsonto MRS agar plates. For qualitative analysis, the cell monolayers and thebacteria were methanol fixed and stained by addition of a 10% Giemsa solution.</p></sec><sec id="subsec2.2"><title>2.2. Growth inhibition ofvaginosis-associated pathogens</title><p>The effect of Lcr35 on the growth of three pathogens wasinvestigated using the following strains: Candida albicans ATCC10231, <italic>Prevotella bivia</italic> ATCC29303, and <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> ATCC14018. Coculture assays were performed in either Sabouraud broth (Candida) or brainheart infusion supplemented with yeast extract (1%), maltose (0.1%), glucose(0.1%), and horse serum (10%) (<italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Gardnerella</italic>). Each pathogen (10<sup>8</sup> UFC) was incubated alone (control) and with the Lcr35 (10<sup>8</sup> UFC) at37&#x000b0;C under anaerobic conditions for the two vaginosis-associated bacteria(AnaeroGen, Oxo&#x000ef;d). Aliquots were removed after 4, 8, and 24 hours ofincubation, serially diluted and plated on appropriate media (Sabouraud,Gardnerella, or MRS) to determine the bacterial colony counts of both thepathogens and Lcr35. Statistical analyses of the data were performed using the Mann-Whitney test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec3"><title>3. RESULTS</title><sec id="subsec1.1"><title>3.1. Adhesion of Lcr35 to cervical and vaginal cells</title><p>The ability of Lcr35 to adhere to vaginal and cervicalcells is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Whatever the MOI and the cell line, the probioticstrain was able to adhere to the cell surface monolayer. The highest number ofadherent bacteria was observed with the vaginal cell line, with an average of4.75 10e5 CFU per cm<sup>2</sup> after 1 hour of incubation. No majordifference was observed between the levels of adhesion obtained after 1 hourand 3 hours of incubation (data not shown), suggesting that adhesion occursrapidly after the initial contact between the cells and the bacteria. Microscopical observations of Giemsa-stained preparation showed typical chainsof Lcr35 randomly dispersed on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="subsec3.2"><title>3.2. Growth inhibition ofvaginosis-associated pathogens</title><p>The antagonist effect of Lcr35 against three mainpathogens, <italic>P. bivia</italic>, <italic>G. vaginalis</italic>, and <italic>C. albicans</italic>, was assessed in coculture assays and compared with thegrowth ability of each pathogen in the same culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Adecrease in the cell division rate of the three microorganisms tested wasobserved from 4 hours of coincubation. When the viable bacteria in the mixedsuspension were counted over a longer period of time, bactericidal activity wasdetected between 8 and 24 hours of incubation for all pathogens with the <italic>Prevotella</italic> strain being the mostsusceptible (4-log10 units decrease in the number of viable cells). In no casethere was a bactericidal effect against <italic>Lactobacilli</italic>;the number of viable Lcr35 cells was either constant over the incubation period(coculture with <italic>C. albicans</italic>) orincreased (coculture with <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> and <italic>P. bivia</italic>) (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec4"><title>4. DISCUSSION</title><p>				<italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species in the female urogenital system act as a barrierto infection and  contribute to the control of the vaginal microbiota bycompeting with other microorganisms for adherence to epithelial cells,displacing pathogen biofilm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and/or inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Hence the use of probiotic strains of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> is potentially interesting both as preventive andcurative agents.</p><p>Unlike the use of vaginal epithelial cellscollected from healthy premenopausal women, assaysperformed  with immortalized  epithelial cell lines, which closely resemble theepithelial differentiation patterns of normal human tissues, are more accuratefor standardizing tested bacterial adherence and allow comparison of differentresearch approaches. The three epithelial cell lines tested in this study weredeveloped from normal human vagina, ectocervix, and endocervix tissue, andtheir characteristics closely resembled those of their tissues of origin andprimary cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We can thus speculate that adhesion assays performed with thismaterial reproduce more faithfully the in vivo situation than experimentsperformed with any cell line derived from human carcinoma of the lower genitaltract mucosa. This is particularlyimportant when comparing bacterial strains belonging to the complex <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genus that includesbacterial strains with highly specific characteristics. Using these cell lines,we observed specific adhesion of an <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> strain, Lcr35, previously selected for its probiotic features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Adhesion occurred even at a low MOI (1:1) and within less than 1 hourof contact, which corresponds to a highly dynamic process.</p><p>Adhesion of Lcr35 to vaginal epithelial cellswould allow colonization of the vaginal mucosa and therefore could limit theovergrowth of pathogens, but the second main property of a potential probioticused as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic microorganisms is direct impairmentof their growth. In this study, we demonstrated that Lcr35 showed bactericidalactivity against both <italic>P. bivia</italic> and <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> in the range of killingstipulated for the bactericidal activity of antimicrobial activity (&#x0003e;2log-unit). In a previous study, Atassi et al. demonstrated that thebactericidal activity of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> toward these two vaginal bacterial pathogens was strain dependent and occurredwithin the first hours of coculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In our experiments, a longer incubation time was required to observebactericidal activity, probably because of the different experimentalparameters used in the two assays. We previously showed that the Lcr35probiotic strain was also able to kill several pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The mechanism(s) underlying this activity has not been elucidated butis likely to be multifaceted and probably includes the production of hydrogenperoxide, lactic acid, and antibacterial compounds. It has been recently shownthat <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> organized inbiofilms is moreresistant to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and lactic acid than planktoniccultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> is thepredominant species observed within biofilms present on the vaginal epitheliumin bacterial vaginosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and Saunders et al. recently showed that strains of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> were able to disrupt <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> preformed biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It would therefore be interesting to test the biofilm activity ofLcr35 against <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> and todetermine if the sessile form of Lcr35 also exhibits antibacterial activityagainst <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> in mixed biofilmassays.</p><p>The antagonist activity of Lcr35 was not limited tobacterial pathogens since the strain was also able to reduce the viability of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Several strains of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> have shown inhibitoryeffects against <italic>C. albicans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], which is the species most often associated with candidiasis. Byinterfering with <italic>Candida</italic> overgrowthin the patients' intestinal or vaginal tract, <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> could provide colonization resistance and maintain lownumbers of yeasts, especially when administered together with antibiotics.</p><p>Relevant clinical trials have suggested thatintravaginal or oral administration of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> strains is able toincrease the numbers of vaginal <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> and restore the vaginal microbiota to normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Lcr35 was isolated from a human intestinal and not vaginal microbiotaand does not belong to the four main species of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> considered to be predominantly linked to the vaginalmicroflora, <italic>L. crispatus</italic>, <italic>L. jensenii</italic>, <italic>L. gasseri</italic>, and <italic>L. iners</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but it has been shown to survive within the human gastrointestinaltract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, Petricevic and Witt recently showed in a clinical studythat topical  administration of Lcr35 enhances the restoration of the vaginalflora after antibiotic treatment of BV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, it might be an excellent candidate for use as a prophylacticagent, taken orally or applied topically. In vivo studies to evaluate itsfeasibility as such are in progress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec5"><title>5. CONCLUSION</title><p>Maintenance or reconstruction of the normal composition ofthe vaginal microflora by applying properly selected <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> may be of prophylactic value in preventing or curinggenitourinary system infections in women. In the light of our experiments, itseems that the probiotic strain <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> Lcr35 would be a good candidate as a protective agent againstboth bacterial vaginosis and <italic>Candida</italic> vaginitis since it was able to adhere to vaginal and cervical cells and toantagonist the growth of vaginosis-associated pathogens. Clinical studies arenow required to assess the in vivo efficacy of such a therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
