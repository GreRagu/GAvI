The mechanism by which cocaine causes neurological damage is very complex and involves several neurotransmitter systems. For example, cocaine increases extracellular levels of dopamine and free radicals, and modulates several transcription factors. NF-&#x003ba;B is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression involved in cellular death. Our aim was to investigate the toxicity and modulation of NF-&#x003ba;B activity by cocaine in PC 12 cells. Treatment with cocaine (1 mM) for 24 hours induced DNA fragmentation, cellular membrane rupture and reduction of mitochondrial activity. A decrease in Bcl-2 protein and mRNA levels, and an increase in caspase 3 activity and cleavage were also observed. In addition, cocaine (after 6 hours treatment) activated the p50/p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B complex and the pretreatment of the cells with SCH 23390, a D1 receptor antagonist, attenuated the NF-&#x003ba;B activation. Inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activity by using PDTC and Sodium Salicilate increased cell death caused by cocaine. These results suggest that cocaine induces cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) and activates NF-&#x003ba;B in PC12 cells. This activation occurs, at least partially, due to activation of D1 receptors and seems to have an anti-apoptotic effect on these cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cocaine is a drug of abuse with a prevalence of 2.8% in USA and 0.3% worldwide. Cocaine is the second highest drug of abuse in USA, according to the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime (UNODC) (source: World Drug Report, 2007; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unodc.org/pdf/research/wdr07/WDR_2007.pdf"/>).</p><p>Cocaine inhibits dopamine transporter (DAT) in plasma membrane causing an increase in extracellular dopamine levels. This results in the stimulation of the brain reward pathway that can lead to the development of addiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Addiction is a chronic relapsing disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and its treatment is the most expensive of the neuropsychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] mainly due to the costs of healthcare, productivity loss and crime (Office of National Drug Control Policy, 2004; United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2007).</p><p>Along with addiction, cocaine can also induce neurological impairment (deficits in cognition, motivation, insight and attention), behavioral disinhibition, emotional instability, impulsiveness, and movement disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Clinical and pre-clinical studies have demonstrated the occurence of learning and memory impairment and movement disorders in cocaine abusers, even after a long period of drug withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Although the cellular mechanisms underlying this deficit have not been identified yet, several lines of investigation suggest that either necrotic or apoptotic neuronal death may account for drug-of-abuse-induced neurological impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Necrotic cell death involves loss of membrane integrity and selective permeability, whereas apoptotic cell death is characterized by membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation and fragmentation. The apoptotic changes are often accompanied by caspase activation and cytochrome c release into cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins (Bax, Bak, Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and others) regulate mitochondrial integrity and cytochrome c release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and so are important determinants of cell death or survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Cocaine neurotoxicity has been associated with induction of apoptosis such as activation of caspase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], loss of mitochondrial potential, and cytochrome c release into cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and alteration of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Cocaine-induced expression of immediate early genes (c-fos, c-jun) and transcription factors (CREB) has been reported by several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and it is suggested that changes in gene transcription may contribute to the development of adaptative responses induced by the use of cocaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) is a transcription factor found in a variety of cell types including neurons and microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B can be activated by pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as pathogen-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cytokines (TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;) and reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B, comprised members of Rel/NF-&#x003ba;B family of proteins, forming homo-and heterodimers through combination of the p65 (or RelA), p50, p52, c-Rel or RelB subunits. It is constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm where it is bound to I&#x003ba;B, a protein that masks the nuclear localization signal of NF-&#x003ba;B thereby retaining it in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Inducers of NF-&#x003ba;B act through intracellular signaling cascades that activate the I&#x003ba;B kinases (IKKs), which phosphorylate two specific N-terminal serines of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; resulting in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; polyubiquitination and degradation in the 26S proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. When I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; is degraded, NF-&#x003ba;B migrates to the nucleus and modulates transcription of target genes involved in cell death. To further understand cocaine-induced neurotoxicity we tested whether cocaine induces cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) and activates NF-&#x003ba;B in PC12 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), bovine serum, horse serum, trypsin, penicillin and streptomycin were provided by Cultilab (Campinas, Brazil).

The remaining supernatants containing nuclear proteins were stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Protein concentration was determined using the BioRad protein reagent. EMSA for NF-&#x003ba;B was performed using a gel shift assay kit from Promega. NF-&#x003ba;B double-stranded consensus oligonucleotide (5'-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3') was end-labeled with &#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by passing the reaction mixture through a Sephadex G-25 spin column (Amersham-Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Purified <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probe (30,000 cpm) was incubated in 20 &#x003bc;L with 5 &#x003bc;g nuclear extracts in a binding reaction mixture containing 50 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 4% glycerol, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.05 &#x003bc;g poly (dI-dC) for 30 min at room temperature.

Supershift assay analysis indicated that cocaine increased the p50/p65 NF-&#x003ba;B complex content. In agreement with our results, others showed activation of NF-&#x003ba;B by cocaine in different models. Chronic administration of cocaine induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation in nucleus accumbens of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Cocaine-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation was also observed in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], human brain endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and in PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Imam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] showed that 24 hours of exposure to low concentrations of cocaine (5&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;M) caused an increase of NF-&#x003ba;B activity in PC12 cells and, in agreement with our results, higher concentrations of this drug did not show significant alteration of this transcription factor after 24 hour treatment.</p><p>So, none of these studies investigated the mechanism of cocaine-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation. This is the first report that investigates the mechanism linking activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and cell death induced by cocaine.</p><p>The involvement of dopaminergic receptors in the activation of this transcription factor by cocaine was also investigated in PC 12 cells. Pre-incubation with a D1 antagonist, SCH 23390, caused a partial reduction in cocaine-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation, suggesting the participation of these receptors in this process. Others have also investigated the participation of dopamine receptors in the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B. Dopamine D1 receptor raised the expression of immediate early genes (such as, c-fos, c-jun, junB and zif-268 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]) that act as positive modulators of transcription factors, including NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Han and col. (2007) suggested that the increase in NF-&#x003ba;B activity caused by dopamine occurs by its interaction with D1 receptors leading to the activation of G protein, increased levels of intracellular cyclic AMP and stimulation of the phospholypase C/PKC pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. These events would lead to the activation of MAP kinases, which in turn could activate NF-&#x003ba;B. Yang et al. (2003) reported that in human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells transiently expressing human D2 receptors, dopamine-induced activation of NF-&#x003ba;B is mainly dependent upon c-Src activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. These investigators also presented evidence that the PI3K and the MEK-ERK pathways are involved in dopamine-induced activation of NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>Dopamine readily oxidizes to form reactive oxygen species (ROS), free radicals, and quinones, a process that can occur either spontaneously in the presence of transition metal ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] or via an enzyme catalyzed reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Activation of dopamine receptor can also increase peroxide hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) formation by protein kinase C (PKC), subsequently leading to activation of p38 MAPK and JNK, that stimulate NF-&#x003ba;B activation as showed by Lee et al. (2006) in mouse embryonic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In the neuronal cell line, NG108-15, the D2 receptor-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation depends upon the MEK-ERK pathway, rather than p38 MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Therefore, multiple mechanisms have been reported to be responsible for mediating the effects of dopamine on NF-&#x003ba;B activation in different cell types.</p><p>NF-kB is a transcription factor activated in response to cellular stress that is involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Depending on the cell type and the apoptotic agent, NF-&#x003ba;B has been reported to mediate or prevent apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The cell death process induced by cocaine was initiated at 6 hours being more pronounced after 24 hours of exposure. We also observed that both necrosis and apoptosis are involved in the induction of cell death by cocaine as observed by rupture of the cell membrane and DNA fragmentation in agreement with finding by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>To further investigate the role of NF-&#x003ba;B in cocaine induced-cytotoxicity NF-&#x003ba;B cell permeable inhibitors were used. The inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B significantly increased the cell death promoted by cocaine treatment, suggesting that this transcription factor plays a protective role in cocaine treated PC12 cells. Lee and colleagues showed an anti-apoptotic effect of NF-&#x003ba;B in PC12 cells death induced by auto-oxidized dopamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. High constitutive NF-&#x003ba;B activity mediates resistance to oxidative stress in neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and, agents that inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B activation induced apoptosis in response to several neurotoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p><p>Cocaine caused a reduction in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein level but no change in pro-apoptotic Bax altering, therefore, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, which triggers cellular apoptosis. The reduction of Bcl-2 levels after exposure to cocaine has also been reported in fetal rat myocardial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. However an increase in Bax levels was observed after 30 minutes and 1 hour of exposure to cocaine (1.5 &#x003bc;M) in locus coerulus cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], whereas no change was found herein. These results demonstrate that different concentrations of cocaine and time of exposure can differently regulate the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.</p><p>In addition, study of caspases, which are also important regulators of apoptosis, revealed that exposure of PC12 cells to cocaine increased caspase-3 activity of and the cleavage of caspase-3 precursors. Several studies have reported the induction of caspase-3 by cocaine both in <italic>vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>] and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Cocaine also caused &#x003b1;-spectrin cleavage in fragments that correspond to the degradation mediated by caspase-3, suggesting that calpain is not involved in the &#x003b1;-spectrin fragmentation process induced by this drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. This data, together with the increase observed in the caspase-3 activity, suggest that cocaine induced apoptosis in PC12 cell by caspase-3 activation.</p><p>An increase of BDNF mRNA levels was found after 6 hours of treatment with cocaine only, indicating a transitory augment of this neurotrophin. Le Foll and colleagues also observed a transitory increase of BDNF mRNA levels in frontal cortex of rats after a single injection of cocaine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. BDNF regulates the differentiation and apoptosis of neurons and glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], and the increase in BDNF may be considered as a line of defense against the apoptosis process caused by cocaine in our model. In fact, the increase in BDNF mRNA levels could be linked to the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. The protective role of NF-&#x003ba;B in cocaine treatment of PC12 cells observed herein may be associated to expression of anti-apoptotic genes, such as BDNF. However the compensatory mechanisms to cell death induced by cocaine were ineffective to abolish the apoptosis process.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The exposure of PC12 cells to cocaine decreased the ratio Bax/Bcl-2, reducing the levels of Bcl-2, and leading to activation of caspase-3 that can act as a modulator of the apoptosis process observed after 24 hours of exposure to the drug (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Moreover, cocaine activated NF-&#x003ba;B (p50/p65) in a concentration and time dependent manner and this effect was partially mediated by D1 receptors. The activation of this transcription factor may represent a compensatory mechanism to limit cell death.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of neurotoxic action of cocaine in PC12 cells</bold>. The treatment of PC 12 cells with cocaine can alter the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, reducing the Bcl2 levels, which could lead to activation of caspase 3 and the trigger of cell death process, seen after 24 hours of treatment. On the other hand, to protect the cell from cocaine-toxic effects activation of NF-&#x003ba;B occurs through D1 receptors. The activation of this transcription factor could lead to transcription of anti-apoptotic genes, such as BDNF that tries to mimitaze the process of cell death.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1756-6606-2-3-7"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that, except for income received from my primary employer, no financial support or compensation has been received from any individual or corporate entity over the past three years for research or professional service and there are no personal financial holdings that could be perceived as constituting a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LBL: participated in all of the experiments, have made substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data; have been involved in drafting the manuscript or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and have written the manuscrip to be published.</p><p>CDM: have made substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data; have been involved in drafting the manuscript or revising it critically for important intellectual content, have given final approval of the version to be published.</p><p>EMK: have made substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data; have given final approval of the version to be published.</p><p>LMY: participated in the design of the study and performed the statistical analysis; have given final approval of the version to be published.</p><p>LSL: particpated in the performance of the experimental (cell culture, Gel Shifts assay)</p><p>MFB: carried out the FACS assay and have given final approval of the version to be published.</p><p>TML: carried out the FACS assay and have given final approval of the version to be published.</p><p>RC: participated in the design of the study and performed the statistical analysis; have given final approval of the version to be published.</p><p>CSP: have made substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data; have been involved in drafting the manuscript or revising it critically for important intellectual content, have given final approval of the version to be published.</p><p>CS: have made substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data; have been involved in drafting the manuscript or revising it critically for important intellectual content, conceived of the study, and participated in its design and coordination.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' information</title><p>This work is part of studies regarding the PhD thesis of LBL.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de S&#x000e3;o Paulo (FAPESP) (C.
