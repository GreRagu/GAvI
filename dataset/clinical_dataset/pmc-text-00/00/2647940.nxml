About 200 cases have been described in the literature to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This syndrome is characterized by multiple enchondromas, hemangiomas and, less often, lymphangiomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Enchondromas are benign cartilaginous tumors that may develop in any site, are most frequently found in phalanges and long bones, but may also affect the tibia, fibula, humerus, ribs or cranium. Soft tissue tumors usually develop with the bone lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>This congenital mesodermal hyperplasia is nonhereditary, and patients are usually asymptomatic at birth. Symptoms usually develop in puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The risk of malignant change is about 25%. Sarcomatous transformation may be seen in bones and soft tissue lesions, but is more frequently found in enchondromas, and its incidence ranges from 15 to 57% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>This report describes the case of a 29-year-old patient with a diagnosis of Maffucci syndrome with malignant transformation and a tumor in the right thigh diagnosed as retiform hemangioendothelioma.</p></sec><sec><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 29-year-old white woman presented with a tumor that had appeared on the right thigh two years before. Physical examination revealed a hard nodule about five centimeters in diameter with no signs of inflammation. Ultrasound showed a heterogeneous tumor measuring 5.0 &#x000d7; 6.5 &#x000d7; 4.5 cm and coarse calcifications within the tumor. Because of hemangiomas in upper extremities, the initial hypothesis was thrombosed hemangioma.</p><p>Histopathological analysis of excisional biopsy specimen showed fusiform and vasoformative tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis suggested a well-differentiated myxoid liposarcoma.</p><p>After the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma, complete tumor staging was performed using chest radiographs and CT, which showed lytic bone lesions in fourth and seventh anterior ribs, and nuclear MRI of right thigh, which showed a large, predominantly cystic and heterogeneous lesion. Therefore, radical tumor resection was performed. Material was sent to the Mayo Clinic, and the final diagnosis was a low-grade vascular neoplasm consistent with retiform hemangioendothelioma and not liposarcoma, as previously thought.</p><p>After one-year follow-up, the patient noticed a new tumor on the right thigh and inguinal region, and biopsy confirmed lymph node metastasis. Chest CT revealed several lung lesions, but etiology was not confirmed by biopsy. Chemotherapy with doxorubicin was initiated, and full clinical response was achieved.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Maffucci syndrome is a rare clinical entity characterized by multiple enchondromas, hemangiomas and, less often, lymphangiomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The disease often develops in puberty (78%), but symptoms are present at birth or are observed in the first year of life in 25% of the cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the case described here, the patient reported that symptoms were first noticed at the end of the second decade of life, an unusual age, but already reported in other cases.</p><p>Bone changes are caused by congenital defects in endochondral ossification and lead to deficits in final bone growth and bone irregularities. Enchondromas are more often found in hand phalanges, metacarpal bones, foot bones, tibia, fibula, radius and ulna [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Distribution is asymmetric, and bone lesions may range from painless edema to pathological fractures. Other bones may be affected, although not as often, as in the case described here, in which ribs were primarily affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]</p><p>Hemangiomas are usually found along soft tissues as bluish nodules, but may also be found in internal organs and mucous membranes, particularly in the brain, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Pathological fractures are found in 26% of the cases; other possible complications are hemorrhage, short stature, pleural effusion and cranial nerve paralysis due to endochondral compression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis from Ollier disease should be established because, although chondrodysplasia is found in both, Maffucci syndrome is associated with risk of malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Sarcomatous transformation occurs in 25% of the cases, mainly in enchondromas, and may also occur in soft tissues and bones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The case reported here showed malignant change to retiform hemangioendothelioma, a rare form of soft tissue sarcoma.</p><p>Retiform hemangiomas (RHE) are extremely rare low-grade variations of well-differentiated angiosarcoma, characterized by high recurrence rates and low metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the case described here, the patient had lymph node metastasis in addition to a rare sarcoma. The treatment of choice in such case is surgical excision with tumor-free margins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Treatment should aim at symptom relief and early detection of malignancies. Surgical procedures consist of osteotomy and curettage of bone lesion. Other therapeutic options are sclerotherapy, irradiation and vascular lesion surgery. Excision is the procedure of choice for soft tissue tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Bone and soft tissue lesions that grow or become painful without a history of trauma should be examined for malignancy and biopsied. No treatment is indicated for asymptomatic patients without malignant transformation, and prognosis is usually good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FTL carried out overall design of the manuscript and was responsible for the writing of the report.
