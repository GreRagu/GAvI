In whole cells, TRPM2 activity requires intracellular ADP ribose (ADPR) and intra- or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but the mechanism and the binding sites for Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation remain unknown. Here we study TRPM2 gating in inside-out patches while directly controlling intracellular ligand concentrations. Concentration jump experiments at various voltages and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of steady-state single-channel gating kinetics provide unprecedented insight into the molecular mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation. In patches excised from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes expressing human TRPM2, coapplication of intracellular ADPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated &#x0223c;50-pS nonselective cation channels; K<sub>1/2</sub> for ADPR was &#x0223c;1 &#x000b5;M at saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of TRPM2 steady-state opening and closing rates (at saturating [ADPR] and low extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>) reveals that Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation is a consequence of tighter binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the open rather than in the closed channel conformation. Four Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions activate TRPM2 with a Monod-Wymann-Changeux mechanism: each binding event increases the open-closed equilibrium constant &#x0223c;33-fold, producing altogether 10<sup>6</sup>-fold activation. Experiments in the presence of 1 mM of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the extracellular side clearly show that closed channels do not sense extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but once channels have opened Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering passively through the pore slows channel closure by keeping the &#x0201c;activating sites&#x0201d; saturated, despite rapid continuous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free wash of the intracellular channel surface. This effect of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> on gating is gradually lost at progressively depolarized membrane potentials, where the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is diminished. Thus, the activating sites lie intracellularly from the gate, but in a shielded crevice near the pore entrance. Our results suggest that in intact cells that contain micromolar ADPR a single brief puff of Ca<sup>2+</sup> likely triggers prolonged, self-sustained TRPM2 activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>TRPM2 belongs to the melastatin-related subfamily of transient receptor potential proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nagamine et al., 1998</xref>) and forms a cation-selective ion channel, which is permeable to Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sano et al., 2001</xref>). It is abundantly expressed in the brain and in immune cells of the monocytic lineage and is activated under conditions of oxidative stress. TRPM2 activity plays important roles in the respiratory burst of neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages and in delayed neuronal cell death after ischemic stroke (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nilius et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The TRPM2 protein is 1,503 amino acids long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nagamine et al., 1998</xref>) and forms homotetrameric channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Maruyama et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to the canonical TRPM family sequences, TRPM2 contains a 270&#x02013;amino acid C-terminal NUDT9-H domain homologous to the ubiquitous mitochondrial NUDT9 enzyme that hydrolyzes ADP ribose (ADPR) into AMP and ribose-5-phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>). TRPM2 channel currents are activated by intracellular ADPR and the isolated NUDT9-H domain is an active ADPR hydrolase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2003</xref>). Many other adenine nucleotides have been implicated in channel regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kolisek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grubisha et al., 2006</xref>); and oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) also leads to TRPM2 activation in intact, TRPM2-expressing cells, although it is still a matter of debate whether H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> acts directly on TRPM2 or by perturbing adenine nucleotide metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wehage et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Perraud et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Buelow et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Early work has shown that activation of TRPM2 by ADPR is strongly potentiated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>). Biochemical studies have shown that calmodulin (CAM) binds to the TRPM2 protein; thus, CAM might be involved in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tong et al., 2006</xref>). Both intra- and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhance TRPM2 currents in whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, but intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays a more prominent role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McHugh et al., 2003</xref>). A recent extensive study on Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of TRPM2 whole-cell currents has led to the postulation of an extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site on the channel that is involved in its activation when intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Starkus et al., 2007</xref>). The mechanism by which Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulates TRPM2 activity is not understood.</p><p>A caveat to the interpretation of most TRPM2-related studies to date is the limited suitability of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hamill et al., 1981</xref>) for studying the biophysics of gating of a channel primarily affected by ligands from the intracellular side. In such studies each experiment is limited to the use of a single composition of intracellular (pipette) solution that gradually dialyzes the cell interior. First, because the rate of current development is limited by the slow time course of this diffusional equilibration (which occurs over tens of seconds), such experiments provide no information on the kinetics of single-channel gating, thus precluding dissection of molecular mechanisms. Second, to construct a dose&#x02013;response curve, each ligand concentration is tested in a different cell, while channel expression varies from cell to cell. Third, the assumption that the cytosolic face of TRPM2 channels experiences a solution identical to the pipette solution is not necessarily true, given that the majority of the cellular machinery is still in place, including enzymes that produce or metabolize ADPR, compartments that can rapidly take up or release Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as well as plasma membrane pumps, and channels that may alter submembrane [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] despite strong exogenous buffering. Thus, because of the complexity of the entire cell it is hard to distinguish direct effects on TRPM2 itself from indirect effects that alter some intracellular factor involved in the regulation of the channel.</p><p>To study TRPM2 gating more directly, and at a single-molecule resolution, we have established a system for expressing TRPM2 in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes and for selective recording of TRPM2 currents in excised inside-out patches in which the concentrations of ligands bathing the cytosolic surface of the channels can be directly and rapidly controlled. With combined analysis of steady-state, single-channel recordings and macroscopic concentration jump experiments at various voltages we have elucidated the mechanism of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation and the spatial location of the binding sites for activating Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions on the TRPM2 channel. Our results firmly establish that these &#x0201c;activating sites&#x0201d; are found intracellularly of the gate, but not on the protein surface. Rather, they are buried in a shielded vestibule in immediate vicinity of the mouth of the pore. The affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> is higher in the open channel state, and binding of four Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions results in an overall &#x0223c;10<sup>6</sup>-fold activation that is well described by the Monod-Wymann-Changeux (MWC) model. Our findings bear important implications for our understanding of how TRPM2 channels respond to metabolic signals in intact cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Molecular Biology</title><p>The full-length human TRPM2 cDNA clone, inserted into pCMV6-XL4, was purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc.

To obtain various levels of channel expression, 0.1&#x02013;10 ng of hTRPM2 cRNA was injected in a constant 50-nl volume and recordings were done 2&#x02013;3 d after injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Calibration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> Concentrations</title><p>To determine free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the micromolar range, we used Ca-Green 5N (Invitrogen) fluorescence (excitation, 505 nm; emission, 535 nm). Apparent binding parameters of this dye at 25&#x000b0;C and pH 7.1 were obtained by stepwise titration with CaCl<sub>2</sub> (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200810109/DC1">http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200810109/DC1</ext-link>). Using these parameters we then measured a free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] of 4.4 &#x000b5;M in our 140-mM sodium gluconate&#x02013;based bath solution in the absence of high-affinity chelators and without added Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Careful two-way titrations revealed a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for calcium gluconate of &#x0223c;20 mM (Fig. S2) at 25&#x000b0;C and pH 7.1.

The back of the pipette, containing the electrode, was filled with a solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH. The bath solution (140 mM sodium gluconate, 2 mM magnesium gluconate<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.1, with NaOH) was supplemented with 0 &#x000b5;M, 32 &#x000b5;M, 100 &#x000b5;M, 320 &#x000b5;M, 1 mM, or 3.2 mM calcium gluconate<sub>2</sub> to obtain 4.4, 7.6, 14.8, 43.6, 125, and 398 &#x000b5;M free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], respectively. To obtain 8 nM, 30 nM, 100 nM, 300 nM, and 1 &#x000b5;M free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], we added 1 mM EGTA and 0, 70, 240, 500, and 760 &#x000b5;M Ca(gluconate)<sub>2</sub>, respectively, and readjusted the pH to 7.1. Na<sub>2</sub>-ADPR (Sigma-Aldrich) was added from a 32-mM aqueous stock solution. Patches were excised and transferred into a custom-made micromanifold accommodating eight flow lines, connected to the bath electrode through a 140-mM KCl-agar bridge, where the cytoplasmic surface was continuously superfused at 25&#x000b0;C with standard bath solution containing various test substances. This flow chamber had a dead volume of &#x0223c;8 &#x000b5;l and the flow rate of the bath solution was &#x0223c;0.5 ml/min. Switching between solutions was implemented by computer-driven electric valves (HEKA) and occurred with minimal mixing; the kinetics of solution exchange was characterized by a delay of &#x0223c;1 s (because of the dead volume), followed by an abrupt transition period. To measure solution exchange rate, endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel currents were activated by application of 1 mM of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of a NaCl-based intracellular solution, and the rate of decay of this Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current upon rapid removal of intracellular Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) was fitted by a single exponential, yielding an estimate of 58 &#x000b1; 10 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 16) for the rate of solution exchange.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Basic properties of human TRPM2 channels expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes.

These data indicate that the rundown in excised patches, observed in the presence of saturating [ADPR] and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, reflects progressive, irreversible inactivation of channels gating with high P<sub>o</sub>, rather than a graded decline in channel open probability.</p><p>A closer observation of patches with smaller numbers of channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>) exposed to saturating ligand concentrations (&#x0003e;40 &#x000b5;M [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and 32 &#x000b5;M ADPR) confirmed that the rundown indeed consisted of a progressive irreversible loss of active channels over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, red arrows), while the remaining channels continued to gate with a high P<sub>o</sub> approaching unity (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, right, expanded segments on bottom).

Intriguingly, we invariably observed an &#x0223c;20 times faster macroscopic current decay upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>), suggesting that the closing rate might also be affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but with an apparent affinity too high for its detection in steady-state records because channels cease to open at submicromolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.</p><p>To measure closing rate at such submicromolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, we resorted to macroscopic concentration jump experiments using a series of bath solutions in which free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was buffered to 8 nM (our &#x0201c;zero-Ca<sup>2+</sup>&#x0201d; solution), 30 nM, 100 nM, 300 nM, or 1 &#x000b5;M using EGTA. We repeatedly activated macroscopic TRPM2 currents using 125 &#x000b5;M Ca<sup>2+</sup>, followed by a sudden switch to these test Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The rate of current relaxation to a new equilibrium, elicited by a sudden change in the rates of gating, is given by the sum of the opening and the closing rate under the new condition. Because opening rates are extremely low at &#x0003c;5 &#x000b5;M [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], the staircase-like current decay seen in these test segments (see expanded traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>, bottom) reflects channel closing rate, given by the inverse of the time constant of a fitted single exponential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>, top, colored lines, time constants are in milliseconds). Our extended dose-response curve for channel closing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, closed diamonds) clearly showed a dose-dependent acceleration of channel closure by lowering [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the submicromolar range. Importantly, for 4.4 &#x000b5;M [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, the concentration jump experiments yielded an estimate of closing rate similar to that obtained from steady-state single-channel analysis.</p><p>A simple mechanism by which a ligand can activate a channel is if the binding site has a higher affinity for the ligand in the open than in the closed channel conformation: by microscopic reversibility, ligand binding will then stabilize the open state. Because the apparent affinities for affecting opening and closing rate reflect the ligand-binding affinity of the closed and open channel, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Csan&#x000e1;dy and Adam-Vizi, 2004</xref>), the kinetic results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 (B and C)</xref> are compatible with such a mechanism. The fourfold symmetry of homotetrameric TRPM2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Maruyama et al., 2007</xref>) implies at least four Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites, prompting us to consider the MWC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Monod et al., 1965</xref>), a simple application of the aforementioned concept to a multimeric protein. In this model the channel retains its fourfold symmetry at all times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>): the four subunits transit between open (circles) and closed (squares) conformations in a concerted manner. Ligand binding to individual subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>, black symbols) are independent events and additively affect the energetics of the open-closed equilibrium by virtue of the difference in ligand dissociation constants of the open (<italic>K</italic><sub>do</sub>) and the closed channel (<italic>K</italic><sub>dc</sub>). In essence, each binding event alters the unliganded closing rate (&#x003b1;) and opening rate (&#x003b2;) by some constant factor (<italic>f</italic> and <italic>g</italic>, respectively). We performed an ensemble fit (see Materials and methods) of the three dose-response curves for opening rate, closing rate, and P<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;C</xref>, closed circles) using the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref> and obtained an excellent fit to all three curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;C</xref>, solid lines; predicted midpoints are plotted in each panel). Thus, in the presence of saturating ADPR, activation of TRPM2 by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is well described by the MWC model with the kinetic parameters printed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>. The fact that the time courses of channel closure are reasonably fitted by single exponentials even in the 100-nM range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>), where the population of open channels is likely distributed between several different open states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>, bottom states), suggests that, at least for open channels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding/unbinding is in rapid equilibrium compared with the rates of channel closure.</p></sec><sec><title>Closed Channels Do Not Sense Millimolar Extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup></title><p>Because extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> strongly potentiates TRPM2 whole-cell currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McHugh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Starkus et al., 2007</xref>), we performed experiments similar to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, but in the presence of 1 mM of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the extracellular (pipette) solution.

This strongly suggests that the activating sites are located on the intracellular side of the channel gate, where as soon as a channel closes, any local elevation in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], caused by prior Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the open pore, is instantaneously (within &#x0223c;2 &#x000b5;s; see Discussion) eliminated by the rapid vectorial flow of the bath solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Closure of Open Channels Is Slowed by Millimolar Extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup></title><p>Closing rate is a property of the open channel but, in contrast to opening rate, TRPM2 closing rate is not sensitive to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the micromolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, closed circles). Therefore, the fact that 1 mM of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> failed to affect steady-state closing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, open circles) does not preclude the possibility that the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> might elevate local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] around the activating sites of an open channel caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions entering through the pore.

Once channels have closed, the activating sites, which are located intracellularly of the gate, are cut away from Ca<sup>2+</sup>, hence channels remain shut. Note a few occasional reopening events in the right current trace in A, which typically follow brief closures (e.g., blue arrow), suggesting that some fraction of very brief closed events is too short to allow dissociation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the activating sites. Such occasional reopenings might explain why in the presence of 1 mM of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 4.4 &#x000b5;M [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> the macroscopic current relaxations yield a slightly smaller estimate of closing rate than the steady-state data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, white circle vs. diamond for 4.4 &#x000b5;M [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JGP_200810109_RGB_Fig6"/></fig> Again, like in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, TRPM2 currents decayed as a staircase, with almost no channel opening events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>, right trace and blue single-exponential fit line), but the time constant of channel closure was dramatically prolonged compared with that seen in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>, left trace and red single-exponential fit line).

This suggests that the activating sites are not on the protein surface but in a deep vestibule, in the immediate vicinity of the cytosolic mouth of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). In the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, top), sudden removal of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> results in immediate loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the activating sites, followed by channel closure at the fast rate (&#x0223c;20 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) characteristic of nonliganded channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>, pathway marked by solid arrow). In contrast, when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present on the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, bottom), Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions arrive through the pore as long as the gate is open and maintain a high local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] around the activating sites, keeping them saturated and allowing the channel to close at the slow rate of &#x0223c;1 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> characteristic of fully liganded channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>, pathway marked by dotted arrow).

The present study is the first in which TRPM2 channel gating has been scrutinized at the single-channel level in a cell-free system.</p><p>The apparent affinities we have found for activation of TRPM2 by both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ADPR greatly differ from those established in whole-cell experiments (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lange et al., 2008</xref>). We have tested whether differences in our recording conditions could have affected channel activation, but have found that neither our lower [ADPR] nor the use of Na<sup>+</sup> as the intracellular cation were responsible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). One possible explanation for the discrepancy could be a potential loss of some regulatory factor upon patch excision. However, a second possible explanation is that whole-cell TRPM2 currents do not saturate at &#x0223c;1 &#x000b5;M [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], similar to large-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels that are activated in living cells by micromolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> from sparks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rothberg and Magleby, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">P&#x000e9;rez et al., 2001</xref>). This is because the effect of high micromolar intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> on TRPM2 whole-cell currents has never been tested and so it cannot be excluded that further activation would have been obtained in such experiments. (Of note, our gating model [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>] also predicts an &#x0223c;100-fold increase in P<sub>o</sub> between [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> values of 8 nM and 2 &#x000b5;M, because of a decrease in channel closing rate; and the reliability of the &#x0201c;plateau-ing&#x0201d; seen at &#x0223c;1 &#x000b5;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> in whole-cell dose-response curves is somewhat limited by the fact that in such experiments each individual ligand concentration is tested in a different cell.) An example supporting such a possibility is the homologue TRPM4, for which a K<sub>1/2</sub> value for Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of 320 nM was estimated from whole-cell current responses restricted to a range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> between 100 nM and 1 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Launay et al., 2002</xref>), whereas a K<sub>1/2</sub> of 20 &#x000b5;M was obtained for the same channel from whole-cell currents assayed over a range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> between 100 nM and 100 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ullrich et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, it remains a possibility that in intact cells the local ligand concentrations that the channels experience might differ from the bulk cytosolic concentrations and that the concentration of one ligand influences the local concentration of the other, such that these remain poorly defined in whole-cell experiments. As an example, the almost all-or-none type activation by intracellular [ADPR] (n<sub>H</sub> of &#x0223c;9) found in whole cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>) is at large with our findings in inside-out patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>) and, if taken at face value, would be hardly explained by any reasonable molecular mechanism. It seems more likely that, through the stimulation of TRPM2 open probability, increasing [ADPR] increasingly elevates local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] around the activating sites, yielding apparent positive feedback. Also along these lines, we found no evidence for voltage dependence of gating in symmetrical Na<sup>+</sup>-based solutions, suggesting that such a phenomenon, reported in whole cells loaded with Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Perraud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>), was caused by voltage-dependent alteration of some cellular parameter involved in TRPM2 regulation. Thus, although whole-cell studies have outlined TRPM2 as a channel regulated by a multitude of diverse factors in an extremely complex manner, further biophysical studies in cell-free patches will need to sort out which of those factors really act on the TRPM2 protein itself.</p><p>Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hill et al., 2006</xref>), TRPM2 activity runs down in excised patches. Although all our efforts to prevent this rundown have so far failed, our detailed kinetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) revealed that the rundown consists of a progressive irreversible decline in the number of active channels, rather than of a graded decline in open probability. In the face of this technical challenge we have developed a significant collection of novel analytical tools to extract single-channel gating parameters using both noise analysis of macroscopic patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> and Fig. S4) and ensemble maximum likelihood fitting of sets of dwell-time histograms (Fig. S5). These tools will prove useful for further studies of TRPM2 gating.</p><p>Through a combination of steady-state single-channel recordings and macroscopic concentration jump experiments we established [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dependence of single-channel gating parameters, including closing rates in the submicromolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] range in which the channels do not open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The MWC model, with four postulated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites, provides an excellent framework for understanding the dependence of these parameters on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the presence of saturating ADPR. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of more than four Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites (Fig. S5), no more than four sites were required to fit the kinetic parameters of gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Our fit parameters suggest that binding of a single Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion to an activating site, by virtue of its tighter binding in the open conformation, increases the open-closed equilibrium constant by a factor of &#x0223c;33 (<italic>g</italic>/<italic>f</italic>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>), equivalent to an energetic stabilization of the open state by &#x0223c;3.5 kT or &#x0223c;8.6 kJ/mol. Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to all four sites activates TRPM2 &#x0223c;10<sup>6</sup>-fold corresponding to a &#x0223c;14-kT reduction of the open state free energy. As a comparison, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the best studied ligand-gated channel, contains only two ligand-binding sites, and a comparable overall activation (&#x0223c;10<sup>8</sup>-fold) requires much larger effects (&#x0223c;10<sup>4</sup>-fold) of the two individual ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jackson, 1986</xref>).</p><p>The rate of our solution exchange, estimated from the rate of decay of endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current upon sudden removal of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) was &#x0223c;50 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, less than &#x0223c;3 times faster than the fastest TRPM2 closing rates we have measured (&#x0223c;20 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, closed diamonds). It is therefore likely that this maximal closing rate of unliganded TRPM2 is slightly underestimated. Steady-state analysis of the small number of openings we could collect from segments of record at 8 nM of intracellular and &#x0223c;4 &#x000b5;M of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, from 14 patches with very large numbers of channels, gave an estimate for closing rate of 27 &#x000b1; 5 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Nevertheless, this potential inaccuracy does not affect the conclusions of our study.</p><p>Our experiments have outlined the probable location of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites on the TRPM2 channel responsible for activation of gating. The clear demonstration that these binding sites sense extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> when the pore is open, but not when the pore is closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), allows us to assign them with great confidence to a location intracellularly of the gate. This conclusion is further corroborated by our demonstration that membrane depolarization, which slows the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through the open pore, reduces the effect of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the activating sites of an open channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). In contrast, the dramatic slowing by external Ca<sup>2+</sup> of channel closure upon removal of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>) suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions entering through the pore are able to keep the activating sites saturated as long as the pore remains open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, bottom). This is intriguing because, at a molecular level, the rate at which the cytosolic surface of the channels was superfused with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution can be designated at best as extreme. From the 18-nm diameter of the TRPM2 channel structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Maruyama et al., 2007</xref>) and the &#x0223c;1-cm/s flow rate of our bath solution we calculate that the entire solution volume in contact with the channel surface is continuously displaced by fresh Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution every &#x0223c;2 &#x000b5;s. Note that this rate of continuous rinsing is much faster than the rate of solution exchange, which reflects the rate of passage over the patch of a thin layer of solution of mixed composition (requiring &#x0223c;20 ms; see Materials and methods). We estimate that despite this extremely intensive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free surface wash the activating sites of an open channel experience high micromolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] when extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present and the membrane potential is negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C</xref>). These sites must therefore be buried in some deep crevice, shielded from the protein surface, near the intracellular mouth of the pore. The recent, low-resolution electron microscopic reconstruction of TRPM2 revealed a bell-shaped channel structure, consisting of a small compact half-dome pointing toward the extracellular side and a large, sparse intracellular domain containing multiple internal cavities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Maruyama et al., 2007</xref>). Based on our functional results we consider these cavities as the most likely candidates for the location of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites responsible for TRPM2 activation.</p><p>The broader significance of our dissection of the biophysical properties of single TRPM2 molecules is that these provide important clues for understanding the regulation of TRPM2 activity in intact cells. Although TRPM2 channels are believed to act as coincidence detectors of simultaneous rises in intracellular [ADPR] and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], our results suggest that these two ligands regulate TRPM2 with very different dynamics. In our inside-out patches exposed to a flowing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution activating Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions were washed away as soon as a channel closed; hence extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> alone was insufficient to maintain steady-state gating. In contrast, under the static conditions of an intact cell (even in the presence of strong exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering!) the local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] around the activating sites of a TRPM2 channel, resulting from Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions entering through its pore, is unlikely to be completely dissipated before that channel reopens. This allows extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> alone to maintain steady-state TRPM2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McHugh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Starkus et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, it is likely that channels sense some of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering through the pores of nearby channels. Thus, in an intact cell, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> provides robust positive feedback to TRPM2 activation. Our results suggest that in living cells that contain as little as a few micromolar ADPR a single puff of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is sufficient to trigger prolonged, self-sustained TRPM2 activity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank D&#x000f3;ra Mayer for oocyte isolation and injection.</p><p>L.
