A number of isolated mushroom constituents have been shown to modulate immunity. Five commonly consumed edible mushrooms were tested to determine whether whole mushrooms stimulate the immune system <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The white button (WB) extracts readily stimulated macrophage production of TNF-&#x003b1;. The crimini, maitake, oyster and shiitake extracts also stimulated TNF-&#x003b1; production in macrophage but the levels were lower than from WB stimulation. Primary cultures of murine macrophage and ovalbumin (OVA) specific T cells showed that whole mushroom extracts alone had no effect on cytokine production but co-stimulation with either lipopolysacharide or OVA (respectively) induced TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-1&#x003b2; while decreasing IL-10. Feeding mice diets that contained 2% WB mushrooms for 4 weeks had no effect on the <italic>ex vivo </italic>immune responsiveness or associated toxicity (changes in weight or pathology of liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract). Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) stimulation of mice that were fed 1% WB mushrooms were protected from DSS induced weight loss. In addition, 2% WB feeding protected the mice from transient DSS induced colonic injury.

The <italic>in vivo </italic>effects of edible mushrooms required a challenge with DSS to detect small changes in TNF-&#x003b1; and transient protection from colonic injury. There are modest effects of <italic>in vivo </italic>consumption of edible mushrooms on induced inflammatory responses. The result is not surprising since it would certainly be harmful to strongly induce or suppress immune function following ingestion of a commonly consumed food.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>There are thousands of different mushroom species and about 700 species have been reported to have significant pharmacological properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Medicinal mushrooms have a long history of use in traditional Oriental therapies. Hot-water-soluble fractions of medicinal mushrooms have been used as medicine in the Far East [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, mushroom extracts have begun to be sold as dietary supplements with a world-wide market value of around 5&#x02013;6 billion US dollars per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Isolated mushroom constituents have been shown to have beneficial effects on experimental cancer. Efforts have been made to isolate and purify the active and protective components of mushrooms. Many of these compounds are large polysaccharides or &#x003b2;-(1&#x02192;6)-branched &#x003b2;-(1&#x02192;3)-linked glucans. The &#x003b2;-glucans have been shown to inhibit tumor growth <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The &#x003b2;-glucans lentinan from <italic>Lentinus edodes</italic>, schizophyllan (sonifilan) from <italic>Schizophyllum commune</italic>, grifolan from <italic>Grifola frondosa</italic>, and extracts from <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum </italic>all have anti-tumor activity. Intratumor injection of an acid-treated fraction of <italic>Agaricus blazei </italic>inhibited tumor growth of that tumor as well as other tumors at remote sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. An extract from the <italic>Phellinus rimosus </italic>mushroom extended the life span of mice by 96% following injection of tumor cells in an experimental Dalton's lymphoma ascites model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Injection of a methanol crude extract from <italic>Lepista inversa </italic>also increased life span by 50% in a lymphocyte leukemia model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Extracts of multiple varieties of mushrooms have been shown to be protective in experimental cancer models; presumably because in part they boost anti-tumor immunity. Whether these same benefits of mushrooms can be derived from whole mushrooms instead of the isolated components is not known.</p><p>There is considerable information and research on identifying the biologically active components of medicinal mushrooms and using them as therapies and immune system modulators. What is less clear is whether the active components of edible mushrooms are present in adequate amounts to show benefits when consuming whole mushrooms or using extracts from whole mushrooms <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, there are concerns about the toxicologic side effects of whole mushrooms especially the <italic>Agaricus </italic>species that might counter-indicate recommending eating mushrooms. The aims of the present study were 1) to determine what the effects of whole mushroom extracts were on the cytokine profile of macrophage and T cell cultures <italic>in vitro</italic>, 2) to determine whether feeding mice diets that contained 1&#x02013;2% whole mushrooms resulted in measurable changes in immunity, and 3) to determine whether 2% whole mushrooms diets led to pathologic findings in tissues likely to be affected (liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; in RAW 264.7 cells by extracts of commonly consumed mushrooms</title><p>The mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) was treated with mushroom extract (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) or the vehicle DMSO. Cell viability was high following treatment (90&#x02013;95%). Lipopolysacharide (LPS) was used as a positive control to induce production of TNF-&#x003b1; from RAW cells. The white button (WB) mushroom extracts readily stimulated TNF-&#x003b1; production from RAW 264.7 cells at levels comparable to the LPS stimulated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The crimini, maitake, oyster and shiitake extracts all stimulated TNF-&#x003b1; production from the RAW 264.7 cells; however, the amount of TNF-&#x003b1; produced was significantly less than stimulation with the WB mushroom extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Production of TNF-&#x003b1; by RAW 264.7 cells</bold>.

The data from WB mushroom extracts is shown since the highest TNF-&#x003b1; secretion from RAW 264.7 cells was found in the WB stimulated cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The BMDM cells are untransformed mouse macrophage that produce a variety of cytokines. Three cytokines produced by macrophage were picked for analysis: TNF-&#x003b1;, interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-1&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). BMDM cells plus DMSO (control) cultures did not produce TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-10 or IL-1&#x003b2; (data not shown). Like the results from the RAW 264.7 cell line, WB extracts alone stimulated TNF-&#x003b1; production. LPS stimulation also induced TNF-&#x003b1; and the combined effect of WB plus LPS was additive for TNF-&#x003b1; secretion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). For IL-1&#x003b2; production, WB stimulation alone had no effect, LPS stimulation alone induced IL-1&#x003b2; and WB plus LPS increased the secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). WB stimulation induced a small amount of IL-10, while LPS stimulated a robust IL-10 response and interestingly enough WB addition to the LPS containing cultures inhibited IL-10 production (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). BMDM were also treated with crimini and shiitake extracts and the results were similar to those shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> for WB mushrooms (data not shown). The data suggest that WB, crimini and shiitake mushrooms had similar effects on cytokine production from BMDM.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cytokine production by primary BMDM</bold>.

T cell receptor transgenic (OT II) mice were used as a source of antigen (ovalbumin, OVA) specific T cells. The lymphocytes from the spleen of OT II mice were isolated and stimulated with OVA plus DMSO (control), or OVA plus mushrooms. In the absence of OVA stimulation the splenocytes did not produce cytokines. OVA stimulation (control) induced IL-10 production that was inhibited by crimini, shitake and oyster mushroom extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Conversely, interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; secretion was induced by crimini, shiitake and oyster mushroom extracts in two experiments and unaffected by mushroom extracts in another (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). IL-4 was undetectable in all of the supernatants tested. The experiment was repeated using OVA stimulation alone (DMSO control) or WB stimulation. IFN-&#x003b3; secretion was 2058 &#x000b1; 60 pg/ml in the controls and 2534 &#x000b1; 154 pg/ml in the WB stimulated cultures while IL-10 was 3500 &#x000b1; 50 pg/ml in the controls and 1200 &#x000b1; 135 pg/ml in the WB stimulated cultures (control IL-10 values are significantly higher than WB IL-10 values P &#x0003c; 0.05). The data suggest that in these mixed cell cultures all 4 types of mushrooms either increased IFN-&#x003b3; or had no effect.

The weight curves show that WB mushroom containing diets (2% by weight) did not negatively affect body weight and instead the mice continued to grow over the 4 weeks of the study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Histopathology sections of the stomach, intestine, kidney, and liver showed that feeding WB mushrooms for 4 weeks was not associated with any pathology in these tissues (data not shown). Unchallenged mice had undetectable levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-10 and IL-1&#x003b2; in the colon or blood whether or not they were fed WB mushrooms (data not shown). Splenocytes were removed from the WB and oyster fed mice and cell surface staining showed that there was no change in the percentage of CD4+, CD8+, B cells, and macrophage as a result of including mushrooms in the diet (data not shown). The splenocytes from the WB, oyster and control fed mice were stimulated <italic>in vitro </italic>with the T cell mitogen concanavalin (Con) A or the macrophage/B cell mitogen LPS.

Con A stimulation induced IL-10 in cultures from all 3 groups of mice but there was no effect on IL-10 production as a result of the mice consuming mushrooms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). LPS stimulation induced considerably more IL-10 than Con A but still all 3 groups of mice produced IL-10 and there were no significant differences across the groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

Like LPS, DSS stimulates the innate immune system. DSS initiates mucosal epithelial cell damage by disrupting barrier function, leading to ulceration, bleeding, and transient shortening of the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The damage to the gut mucosa begins to repair following removal of the DSS from the water. Consistent with the acute colitis induced by DSS the control fed mice showed a drop in weight after 4 d of DSS treatment and then the mice recovered in weight almost completely by 10 d post-DSS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Weight loss in the oyster fed mice was not different from the control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Conversely, the WB fed mice did not lose as much weight as the other 2 groups (significantly different at d4, d5, and d6 and not different at d10, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Additional groups of mice were fed control, 1% WB and 1% oyster diets but were not exposed to DSS.

The standard approach has been to purify the components and then to test them for efficacy. It is likely that mushrooms possess multiple immunoregulatory components including the selenium, B vitamins and polysaccharides that when ingested together or mixed <italic>in vitro </italic>together would have effects that differed from the isolated components. <italic>In vitro </italic>WB, crimini, shiitaki, and oyster extracts reduced IL-10 production and increased IL-1&#x003b2;, and TNF-&#x003b1; production by macrophage. The activation of the macrophage with the mushroom extracts preferentially stimulated T cell production of TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; and very little IL-10. This pattern of immuno-regulation by mushrooms is consistent with a model whereby whole mushroom consumption would induce a modest but important boost in immune responses that would improve anti-cancer immunity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In macrophage, the inhibition of IL-10 and activation of IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and TNF-&#x003b1; would result in an activated phenotype for the macrophage that would induce production of T cell and macrophage cytokines like IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; that are important in clearance of tumorogenic cells, pro-inflammatory signaling, and killing of infectious organisms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In RAW 264.7 cells the induction of TNF-&#x003b1; production was highest in LPS and WB stimulated rather than the crimini, maitake, oyster, or shitake stimulated cells. The differences might be a result of differences in the quantity of the immunomodulatory substance or substances and or differences in solubility of mushrooms in the DMSO used to produce the extracts. However, the direction of the changes (increase <italic>versus </italic>decrease) were not different among the mushroom treatments. The lack of differential effects on cytokine secretion by the mushroom extracts suggests that the whole mushrooms must share a common component(s) that act to regulate immune function.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Model of the effects of whole mushrooms on anti-cancer immunity</bold>. Whole mushrooms contain active components that can induce TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2; <italic>in vitro </italic>while inhibiting IL-10 production. Consuming mushrooms in the diet also had an effect on immune function but that effect is evident only when the immune system is challenged. The change in the immune response induced by whole mushrooms is consistent with a potentially important improvement in cancer surveillance and anti-microbial killing while increasing inflammation and perhaps autoimmunity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2172-10-12-7"/></fig><p>Feeding mice diets that included up to 2% WB mushrooms over 4 weeks had no effect on a number of immune parameters including percentage of T and B cells, Con A and LPS stimulated cytokine production and colonic expression of a panel of cytokines including IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-10, TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;. This is consistent with data by Wu et al. that showed that WB mushroom feeding at much higher doses (2&#x02013;10%) and for 10 weeks did not affect T cell, B cell, NK cell, and macrophage cell numbers or affect Con A and LPS induced cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This is not completely unexpected since it would certainly be harmful to have a commonly present dietary component induce or suppress normal immune function.</p><p>DSS is normally used to cause transient colonic injury and as a model of acute colitis. WB feeding was protective for some parameters of DSS colitis; early weight loss and colonic shortening. It is unclear by what mechanism the WB feeding would protect from colonic injury. When challenged with DSS the WB mushroom fed animals transiently produced more TNF-&#x003b1; in the colon but showed no other changes in immune function. TNF-&#x003b1; production is negatively associated with colitis symptoms in the DSS model. Therefore the increased local production of TNF-&#x003b1; and decreased colitis injury following WB intake are paradoxical. The improvement in colitis symptoms is unlikely to be related to the increased production of TNF-&#x003b1; but instead might reflect a change in the composition of the bacterial microflora that has been shown to impact disease symptoms in the DSS model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The data show that WB mushrooms are protective against colonic injury and the mechanisms underlying the protective effects would be an area worthy of future investigation.</p><p>Agaritine, a natural compound found in the <italic>Agaricus </italic>species of mushrooms, has been implicated as a carcinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Even though animal studies do not show agaritine to be a carcinogen at physiological doses there is still a possible concern regarding toxicity at high intake levels of mushrooms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. WB mushrooms are <italic>Agaricus </italic>mushrooms and are the most commonly consumed mushrooms in the US. Toxicity might be expected in tissues that come into contact with the agaritine like the stomach or intestines and those tissues that might break down or excrete absorbed agaratine like the liver or kidney. Based on the normal growth curves of mice fed 2% WB mushrooms for 4 weeks and data by Wu et al. showing that intake as high as 10% WB mushrooms for 10 weeks did not affect body weight we can conclude that there are no gross effects of feeding mice agaritine containing mushrooms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, histopathology sections of the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver and kidney from mice fed WB mushrooms showed no changes that might indicate an affect of increased agaritine intakes over the 4 weeks of the study. While it still might be possible that longer term intake of agaritine containing mushrooms might prove toxic, the present data using moderate doses of mushrooms does not support the claim.</p><p>Mushrooms contain a significant amount of protein, vitamins and minerals in addition to a large amount of carbohydrate much of which are polysaccharides that are indigestible by humans and therefore are considered dietary fiber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It is possible that differences in the cultivation of mushrooms in different regions and by different growers may affect the composition of an important immunomodulatory factor. One of the limitations of the present study is that the results presented may only reflect results of mushrooms grown in Pennsylvania and more specifically by the manufacturers of those mushrooms in Pennsylvania. Future research should sample mushrooms from different suppliers of the same species for comparison of immunomodulatory functions.</p><p>Several major substances have been isolated from mushrooms and shown to be immunomodulatory. What has not been considered is that mushrooms have a number of bacteria, yeasts and molds associated with them. In fact microorganisms are required for initiation of fruit body formation. Normal healthy mushrooms have high bacterial populations associated with them with the numbers ranging from 6.3&#x02013;7.2 log CFU/g of fresh mushrooms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The bacteria associated with mushrooms are predominately the pseudomonads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The pseudomonads have been shown to activate the innate immune response by interactions with the Toll like receptors (TLR), especially TLR-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is likely that the microbiota ingested with the mushrooms are triggering the mucosal innate immune response through the TLR. More research is required to determine the relative contributions of bacteria, <italic>versus </italic>nutrient and other components of mushrooms as immune system regulators.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Whole mushrooms have a number of components that are potentially immuno-modulatory. The <italic>in vitro </italic>data show that whole mushroom extracts regulate macrophage and T cell production of cytokines in a way that is predicted to be beneficial for boosting anti-tumor immunity. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the immuno-regulatory functions of edible mushrooms are harder to detect. Following challenge with DSS there is a transient protection from colonic injury and a modest increase in TNF-&#x003b1; production locally in the colon. Whether the increase is an effect of known immuno-modulatory nutrient components or as a result of bacteria like the psuedomonads that are associated with mushroom cultivation is not known.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>OTII (OVA specific T cell receptor transgenic) C57BL/6 and control C57BL/6 mice were bred and maintained at the Pennsylvania State University (University Park, PA). The mice were fed synthetic diets made in the laboratory as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In one experimental design the mice were either control fed or fed diets that included 2% powdered mushrooms for 4 weeks (8&#x02013;10 mice per group). In a second design mice were fed control, 1% or 2% WB or oyster mushrooms for 1 week prior to, and continuing through the DSS treatment (4&#x02013;8 mice per group). Controls included additional mice that were fed the same diet but were not treated with DSS (3&#x02013;4 mice per group). Experimental procedures were approved by the Office of Research Protection, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Pennsylvania State University.</p></sec><sec><title>Mushroom extracts</title><p>Commercially available and commonly consumed mushrooms were used for this study. <italic>Agaricus bisporous </italic>or common name WB, brown <italic>Agaricus bisporous </italic>or common name crimini, <italic>Grifola frondosa </italic>or common name maitake, <italic>Lentnula edodes </italic>or common name shiitake, and <italic>Pleurotus eryngii </italic>common name king oyster mushrooms were obtained from Modern Mushroom Farm, Inc. (Toughkenamon, PA). The whole mushrooms were freeze-dried and ground into a fine powder. For the <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments, 10 mg of mushroom powder was suspended in 1 ml dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and sonicated (Branson Ultrasonic Corporation, Danbury, CT) for 8 min at room temperature. The crude unfiltered extracts were used for the experiments below. Mushroom extracts were tested for LPS levels (Limulus Ameobocyte Lysate assay, Cambrex, Walkersville, MD). There was a low level of LPS contamination of the extracts (3 ng/ml in WB and 3.2 pg/ml or less in the other extracts). The final concentration of LPS from the WB extracts added to the cultures was 30 pg/ml LPS. This concentration of LPS was well below the level of LPS required to stimulate cells in vitro. Although commercially produced according to standardized methods, there are likely to be important differences between mushrooms grown in different areas and under different conditions. Thus, freeze-dried mushrooms and extracts will be provided upon request.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and 10<sup>6 </sup>cells per well were cultured in the presence of 100 &#x003bc;g of mushroom extracts or equal concentrations of DMSO (0.1 &#x003bc;l/ml) alone for 72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/L penicillin, 100 mg/L streptomycin and 4 mmol/L glutamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
