It is a common malignancy affecting both children and adults and is continuing to increase rapidly. In the Middle East, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has a high incidence contributing to 7% of total cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] as compared to 4% in USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In Egypt, lymphoma represented 11.66% of all diagnosed cancer cases at the NCI-Cairo University during the period 2003&#x02013;2004 according to the Cancer Pathology Registry, with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma constituting 76.5% of these cases. The B-phenotype comprised 81.1% while T-phenotype represented 9.8% while 9.1% of the cases were non-specified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The advent of immunophenotyping of samples from patients with lymphoproliferative disorders has added much to proper diagnosis and classification and better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the development of these disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the context of lymphoma diagnosis, immunohistochemistry (IHC) has the advantage that the cells of interest are identified morphologically and it is applicable retrospectively to fixed tissues, though fixation might lead to loss of some cells and/or cellular antigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, only a single marker is routinely used on tissue sections, which permits examination of about 100 cells only. Moreover, there is a reported difficulty in demonstrating immunoglobulin light chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>On the contrary, flow cytometry (FCM) allows a more precise definition of individual cell types since the cells of interest are identified by a combination of physical characteristics and the use of multiple antibodies directly conjugated with different fluorochromes. It also has the ability to assess monoclonality through detection of immunoglobulin light chain expression and the results can be available within few hours after receiving the specimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In addition, flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) has become a widely used laboratory procedure for diagnosis and sub-typing of lymphoma. It is an objective and quantitative diagnostic tool that allows quick multiparametric analysis of a very large number of cells (20.000&#x02013;50.000 cells per sample) which could be obtained from small tissue sample (0.1 cm<sup>3 </sup>or even smaller). Meanwhile, analysis of such small samples is facilitated by applying dual &#x00026; triple markers that permit in a single experiment, the detection of expression of combination of 2 or 3 antigens respectively on the same cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]</p><p>Several studies have supported the usefulness of FCI in diagnosing lymphoma in fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples as well as in staging and follow up of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>However, only few reports are available regarding the role of FCM in tissue diagnosis and typing of lymphoma. Morse et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] reported that 9 out of 16 cases (56%) were diagnosed by FCI alone as lymphoma or carcinoma and 4 (25%) were consistent with a final diagnosis of normal or reactive hyperplasia whereas, 3 cases only had histologic evidence of malignancy on biopsies that escaped detection by FCM. Moreover, Dunphy, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] reported that FCI data contributed significantly to, or was consistent with the final tissue diagnosis in 94% of a large series including 373 cases. Furthermore, Martinez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported that FCI diagnosed 218 cases of NHL out of 250 cases with negative predictive value 0.52 and positive predictive value 1.</p><p>In 2000 mayall et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], Dunphy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] reported that FCI in combination with touch imprint cytomorphology was useful in excluding diagnosis of lymphoma and non lymphomatous tumors &#x00026; showed 100% concordance with histopathologic results.</p><p>Regarding Ig light chain detection by FCM, Leers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] estimated the clonality of lymphoproliferative disorders by FCI &#x00026; IHC. They pointed out a major drawback of immunohistochemical detection of monoclonality in B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders which was the lack of contrast between surface-immunoglobulin staining and extracellular immunoglobulin staining. Monoclonality was established in 9 out of 10 NHL cases by FCI while only 6 of 9 cases were conclusive by IHC.</p><p>The present study was conducted to assess the diagnostic role of FCM for immunophenotyping of lymphoma on freshly excised tissue biopsies by comparing the results of FCI to routine histopathology and immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study included 57 freshly excised lymph node specimens obtained from patients who attended to the National Cancer Institute clinics, Cairo University during the period 2003&#x02013;2006 complaining of localized or generalized lymphadenopathy.

Each specimen was divided into three parts, the first part was used for the preparation of touch imprints stained by modified PAP to assess the presence of malignant lymphoma cells and facilitate diagnosis, the second was used to prepare single cell suspension by mechanical dispersion for FCI, and the third was put in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and processed routinely for histologic diagnosis and immunohistochemistry for lymphoma sub-typing.</p><sec><title>Flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI)</title></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry (IHC)</title><p> FCI results were correlated with histopathologic / immunohistochemical  immunophenotyping results  performed on paraffin-embedded material according to standard protocols using the following antibodies (all from Dako Ltd., Cambridge, UK): CD45 (LCA, T29), CD20 (L-26), CD79acy (HM57), CD3 (PC3), CD45RO (UCHL1), CD5 (CD5/45/F6), CD4 (OPD4), CD8 (C8), CD10 (SS2/36), CD56 (NK1), CD15, CD30, ALK-1.</p><sec><title>Preparation of a single cell suspension</title><p>Cells from affected nodes were dispersed by squeezing the tissues against nylon or metal mesh (pore size 50&#x02013;70 &#x003bc;m) into a glass beaker. Tissues were always kept wet by adding sterile phosphate buffered saline solutions (PBS) or serum to maintain cell viability. The suspension was then centrifuged 4&#x02013;5 min at 1200&#x02013;1400 rpm, the supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml PBS. Part of the suspension was used for assessing cell viability by staining with trypan blue and cell counting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The percentage viability was calculated, the required total number is around 10<sup>6</sup>/ml and the optimum acceptable percent of viable cells is about 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The rest of the suspension was subjected to staining for FCI analysis. Cell surface antigen staining was performed using specific directly conjugated fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies which were assembled in panels according to case requirement. The monoclonal antibodies used were CD45, CD45RO, CD 20, CD19, CD3, CD10, CD5, CD23, CD30, CD15, bcl-2, anti-&#x003ba;, anti-&#x003bb;, CD4 and CD8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Antibody panels design</title><p>Isotype control IgG1-FITC/IgG2a-PE was used at the start of each run.

Briefly, 20 &#x003bc;l of each of the used monoclonal antibodies were added to 100 &#x003bc;l of the cell suspension in separate tubes and mixed by vortexing. This was followed by 30 min incubation at room temperature (RT) in the dark, washed twice in 2 ml of PBS and centrifugation for 5 min at 300 &#x000d7; g.

Negative isotype control was run first to identify the position of the negative and the positive populations. At least two plots were drawn during the acquisition of each tube; one of them displayed forward scatter (FSc) on X axis versus side scatter (SSc) on Y axis to identify the size and granularity of cells and to exclude debris and dead cells. The second plot displayed the antibody marker on X axis versus FSc or the other marker in case of dual markers on Y axis.</p></sec><sec><title>Data storage</title><p>Data was stored in the list-mode where the raw data for each parameter on every analyzed cell were sequentially stored in a list to allow reanalysis at any time including redrawing gates, different population gating and new histogram drawing.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample analysis</title><p>Analysis of sample tubes was performed as follows: setting cursors for differentiating positive and negative populations (Isotype control plot analysis) so that &#x02265; 98% of the cells are negative.

The fluorescence intensity was determined by using a log scale of dot plot as follows: the population which lies in region 10&#x000b0;-10<sup>1 </sup>was considered negative, region 10<sup>1</sup>-10<sup>2 </sup>was considered weak, region 10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>3 </sup>was considered moderate and region &#x0003e; 10<sup>3 </sup>was considered strong.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of B-cell monoclonality</title><p>This was determined by overlay of histograms of both anti-kappa and anti-lambda and measuring the difference between them using the Cell Quest software of the machine.

A negative (isotype) reagent control was used with each specimen to determine non-specific binding of the mouse monoclonal antibody to the cells and to allow setting of markers for distinguishing fluorescence-negative and fluorescence-positive cell populations. The marker set on the negative control plot was copied on each analyzed plot of dual markers plots, so dividing it into 4 quadrants.</p><p>Analysis of the population in each quadrant was as follows: the lower left quadrant; double negative to both markers, the lower right quadrant; positive for X axis marker only, the upper left quadrant; positive for Y axis marker only, and the upper right quadrant; positive to both markers.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Sensitivity and specificity of FCI as compared to histopathologic findings were calculated.

These calculations were performed to evaluate the application of FCI in diagnosis and characterization of NHL, HL, RH and NLT.

The positive predictive value for diagnosis of NHL by FCI was 1 and the negative predictive value was 0.87. Within the group of HL, the sensitivity of FCI was 40% only (2 out of 5 HL cases were identified by FCI). However, the specificity was 100%. The positive predictive value was 1 and the negative predictive value was 0.94. Within the group of RH, the estimated sensitivity was 100% and the specificity was lower (89.1%).

However, FCI technique is not reliable in excluding the diagnosis of HL as its sensitivity is only 40%. This could be attributed to the small number of studied HL cases.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>FCI has been applied in the diagnosis of lymphoma in lymph node biopsies as well as in extra-nodal sites. However, it requires fresh specimens to maintain viability and avoid loss of antigenicity through the process of fixation. So, processing of fresh tissue within minutes or few hours is mandatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we investigated the role of FCM in tissue diagnosis and classification of lymphoma. The results of the study showed 88% concordance between FCI aided by touch imprints and histopathology/IHC in the diagnosis of lymphoma. The diagnostic categories were NHL, HL, NLT and RH. Our results are consistent with Mandacova et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] who found a concordance between FCI and histopathology in 89% of cases suspected to be lymphoma and Martinez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] who demonstrated that 218 out of 250 lymphoma cases (87.2%) were successfully diagnosed by FCI. A slightly higher concordance rate (94.1%) was reported by and Dunphy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] who stated that FCI data were consistent with histopathologic diagnosis of 373 lymph node specimens examined.</p><p>A slightly lower percentage of concordance was estimated by Dong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] who assessed the ability of FCM to diagnose and sub-classify lymphoma in 139 cases and found that it was successful in 75% of the cases.</p><p>The role of FCI in diagnosing bone marrow infiltration by B-cell NHL was also assessed. Carulli et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] reported that 89.5% of 114 cases studied were concordant in both FCI and histopathologic examination.</p><p>In the present work, we used a large panel of markers which resembles the panels utilized by other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It is also consistent with the panel established by the clinical cytometry society with the exception of the additional use of CD2 and CD7 for aberrant T-cell expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The large number of markers used in the present study was compromised by using dual and triple markers that detect simultaneous expression of 2 or 3 antigens on the same cell leading to a decrease in the number and quantity of used reagents and hence decrease in the cost/benefit value of the test.</p><p>In the present work, the studied cases were categorized into 7 groups (A-G) based on the results of FCI and histopathology/IHC. In the first group (A), FCI revealed 100% concordance with IHC in the sub-typing of all FCM-diagnosed B-cell lymphoma cases (32 cases) except for a single case which was diagnosed as DLBCL by FCI and was FL by histopathology although this case showed medium to large FSc denoting a large cell size By FCM and IHC was inconclusive for CD10 and negative for BCL-2.</p><p>In the second group, 3 cases were diagnosed as T-cell NHL by both FCI and IHC. These results were consistent with those of Chung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] who illustrated that T-cell surface markers are predominantly expressed in all T-cell lymphomas upon FCM analysis. However, Mayall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] mentioned that FCI is not helpful in the diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma since the CD4/CD8 ratio is not usually restricted in T cell lymphomas and loss of pan-T cell antigens was seen in some T-cell lymphomas. In their study, 4 out of 6 cases of T-cell lymphomas were successfully diagnosed by FCI whereas sub-typing was different in one case which was diagnosed as PTCL by FCI and ALTCL by IHC as it showed positive immunostaining for CD30. In FCI, this case was negative for CD30. However, this controversy in a single case can not be evaluated statistically due to small number of cases. Moreover, Jones et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] demonstrated that CD30 is not expressed in 2% of ALTCL lymphoma cases.</p><p>In the third group 2 cases were successfully diagnosed as HL by both FCI and IHC whereas in the fourth group 3 cases were diagnosed as reactive hyperplasia by FCI and as HL, mixed cellularity type by histopathology. This could be attributed either to an error in the gating technique since the RS cells are CD45- and the chosen gate was adjusted to select CD45+ve cells only or due to loss of the large, fragile CD15+ cells during processing. Also touch imprint didn't show RS-like cells. The same results were reported by Witzig et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and Segal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] who also illustrated that the large neoplastic cells are fragile and are therefore lost during mechanical dispersion and preparation of the samples. In addition, <bold>Braylan </bold>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] mentioned that the neoplastic cells in HL might escape detection by FCM due to their focal distribution in the lymph node.</p><p>In this regard, Young et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] studied 107 FNA of suspected lymphoid lesions by cytology and FCM. Three out of these cases were HL but none of them showed RS cells in the FNA samples. On the other hand, FCI of these 3 cases showed polyclonal populations and they were diagnosed as RH. Similarly, Mayall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and Dong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] provided evidence that FCI is not helpful in diagnosing HL since they identified HL by FCI in 33.3% only of cases and 44% (7 out of 16 HL cases) respectively. These data were confirmed by The Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Lymphoma which was approved by the National health and medical research council in Australia in 2005. According to these guidelines FCM findings are non-contributory in HL because the neoplastic cell population is scanty (1% of the total number of cells in suspension) and the neoplastic RS cells are CD45 negative.</p><p>In the fifth group, there was 100% concordance between FCI and histopathology/IHC results in non-lymphomatous tumors (4/4 cases). However, the exact typing of these tumors by FCM was not possible as it requires additional markers which were not used in this study. These results confirm the previously published data in this regard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Similarly the sixth group showed a 100% concordance (4/4 cases) between FCI and histopathology/IH in the diagnosis of benign lymphoid lesions however the exact varieties of these lesions could not be categorized by FCI. Our results in this regard are in agreement with Jeffers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] who reported that 4 cases were diagnosed as RH by combining data from FNAC and FCI. Two cases were histopathologically diagnosed as RH and the other two cases were defined as Kikuchi's disease. Similarly, Laane et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] demonstrated that 97% of 172 cases of reactive hyperplasia showed concordance between FCI was concordant with the morphologic diagnosis. However, Dunphy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] mentioned that in hyperplastic disorders the classic morphologic criteria are considered more useful in the differential diagnosis.</p><p>In the current study 2 cases (4%) of pathologically-confirmed NHL were diagnosed as RH by FCM. Both cases were TCRBCL and the reason for the discordance was the presence of numerous mature T-cells and failure to detect the monoclonal B-cells population. This is consistant with the results of both Morse et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and Jeffers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Mayall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] showed that only 2 out of 73 cases were confusing because the cytology showed a malignant tumor with highly atypical cells mixed with benign looking lymphoid cells and the FCI showed no evidence of light chain restriction. However, paraffin embedded sections and immunohistochemistry showed that the large highly atypical cells were positive for CD45 and CD20 and negative for cytokeratin, S100, and CD3. Thus, a diagnosis of T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma was made. They assumed that the neoplastic B-cells were not strongly expressing light chains or they were masked by a population of reactive B-cells.</p><p>In this research, B-cell monoclonality was detected by FCI in 100% of FCM-diagnosed B-NHL however, these were not assessed by IHC. It has been reported that IHC does not usually provide a clear evidence of surface LCR due to the large amount of background immunoglobulin in the interstitial spaces of tissues which obscures the relatively weak monoclonal immunoglobulins on the surface of B-cells. The cell isolation and washing; usually required for FCM analysis; allows unambiguous assessment of light chain expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Similarly, Martinez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] showed that LCR was successfully detected in 90.5% of B-cell lymphoma cases (91 cases) whereas it was evaluated in 41.8% of the cases only by IHC.</p><p>In addition, Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] demonstrated that Ig light chain restriction was successfully detected by FCM in 15 of 17 88% of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (primary or secondary), compared to 37% only by IHC. This was attributed to the fact nearly one-third of these cases were histologically suspicious but difficult lesions due to processing artifact, mixed cellular infiltrate, or paucity of abnormal cells. Moreover, Gomyo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] reported that FCI determined monoclonal B-cell population in 14 out of 92 (15.2%) bone marrow biobsies which were considered as negative samples by morphological examination.</p><p>In the present study, the estimated sensetivity and specificity of FCI in diagnosing NHL were 94.9% and 100%; respectively whereas the positive predictive value was 1 and the negative predictive value was 0.87. Comparable estimates were reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Das, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] denoted that combined morphology &#x00026; FCI has a sensitivity &#x00026; specificity of 100%</p><p>Although recent studies demonstrated the significance of using modern techniques such as immunohistochemistry with tissue microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], c-DNA microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and molecular pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] in the proper diagnosis of lymphoma as well as in the prediction of patient's outcome. The use of FCM has the advantage of quick multiparametric analysis of a very large number of cells (20.000&#x02013;50.000) cells and a better statistical representation of the population of interest. The choice of the appropriate antibody combinations, gating strategy and multiparametric analysis plays a key role in diagnosis of lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>FCM analysis offers another advantage over other techniques, where dual and tripple markers could be applied to detect co-expression of 2 or 3 antigens respectively on the same cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Also, FCM has the ability of precise detection of immunoglobulin light chain expression and so assessing the monoclonality of lymphoid populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>FCI has been applied in the diagnosis of lymphoma in lymph node biopsies as well as in extranodal sites. However, it requires fresh specimens to maintain viability and avoid loss of antigenicity through tissue fixation, immediate suspension in chilled nutritional medium after surgical excision followed by processing of fresh tissue within minutes or few hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, Immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue is limited by poor antigen preservation and difficulties in defining antigens restricted to cell surfaces, being lost through fixation, which include the majority of lymphoid markers. Sufficient antibodies have been developed for the identification of B- and T-cell populations on paraffin-embedded tissue. Yet, immunoglobulin light chains are not reliably demonstrated on cell surfaces by this method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>It has been reported that IHC does not usually provide a clear evidence of surface light chain restriction due to the large amount of background immunoglobulin in the interstitial spaces of tissues which obscures the relatively weak monoclonal immunoglobulins on the surface of B-cells.

The false negative results of FCI could be attributed to the presence of heterogeneous populations of lymphocytes that might be present in special situations such as partial involvement of the lymphoid tissue by lymphoma cells, the presence of a follicular lymphoma with normal lymphoid cells in-between the neoplastic follicles, or the presence of numerous residual non-neoplastic lymphocytes among the neoplastic cells of diffuse lymphomas as in T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma. Thus, in highly suspicious cases IHC is still required if no FCI abnormalities were detected. However, FCI has a definite role in detection of monoclonality (light chain) of NHL.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.     </p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AM carried out the preparation of samples, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data.   </p><p>AA carried out the correlation between FCI results and histopathologic/ IHC findings and drafted the manuscript.   </p><p>MH participated in the design of the study, supervision and revision of data interpretation and helped to draft the manuscript   </p><p>SMS conceived of the study, and participated in its design and revised the manuscript critically for important intellectual content.   </p><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.  </p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Lawati</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Santhosh-Kumar</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohammed</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Jaffer</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cancer incidence in Oman, 1993&#x02013;1997</article-title><source>East Mediterr Health J</source><year>1999</year><volume>5</volume><fpage>1035</fpage><lpage>1041</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10983545</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ries</surname><given-names>LAG</given-names></name><name><surname>Eisner</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name><name><surname>Kosary</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name></person-group><source>SEER cancer statistics review, 1973&#x02013;1999</source><year>2002</year><publisher-name>National Cancer Institute</publisher-name></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mokhtar</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Gouda</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Adel</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><source>Cancer pathology registry (2003&#x02013;2004)</source><year>2006</year><publisher-name>National Cancer Institute &#x02013; Cairo University</publisher-name></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Biesemier</surname><given-names>KW</given-names></name><name><surname>Dent</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name><name><surname>Pryzwansky</surname><given-names>KB</given-names></name><name><surname>Folds</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A Comparative Study of Frozen-Section Immunoperoxidase and Flow Cytometry for Immunophenotypic Analysis of Lymph Node Biopsies</article-title><source>Clin Diagn Lab Immunol</source><year>1994</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>299</fpage><lpage>303</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7496966</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B5"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dunphy</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Contribution of flow cytometric immunophenotyping to the evaluation of tissues with suspected lymphoma</article-title><source>Cytometry</source><year>2000</year><volume>42</volume><fpage>296</fpage><lpage>306</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11025488</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1002/1097-0320(20001015)42:5&#x0003c;296::AID-CYTO7&#x0003e;3.0.CO;2-X</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B6"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bauer</surname><given-names>KD</given-names></name><name><surname>Duque</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Shankey</surname><given-names>TV</given-names></name></person-group><source>Clinical flow cytometry.
