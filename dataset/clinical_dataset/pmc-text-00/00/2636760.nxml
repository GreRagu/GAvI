By one estimate, based on an analysis of several studies, one third of the direct medical costs and three quarters of the total costs of asthma can be attributed to uncontrolled disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. For patients with persistent asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are considered to be the most effective controller medications currently available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A range of different molecules and inhaler devices are marketed, and more are regularly being developed, often resulting in several options for ICS delivery.</p><p>Each type of inhaler device has its advantages and disadvantages together with cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and each requires a different inhalation technique. In a recent review of inhaler devices by Virchow et al (2008), device characteristics were compared. Virchow et al suggested that the choice of inhaler may be one reason why asthma remains poorly controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Patient training for each device and regular checking of inhalation technique are, therefore, considered to be essential for optimal treatment delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In fact, many believe, and asthma management guidelines reinforce, that an inhaler should not be prescribed without confirming that the patient knows how to use the device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Prescription cost-containment measures are increasing in many countries and, as more devices become available, there may be pressure to switch patients to a cheaper inhaler device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Indeed, in some countries, such a substitution is mandated by current regulations, and patients who do not accept the substitution have to pay the difference in cost. However, acquisition cost savings from a substitution could be offset by costs related to deterioration in asthma control if the patient is unable or unwilling to use the inhaler device properly.</p><p>The purpose of this retrospective database analysis was to evaluate the impact on asthma control of inhaler device switching without an accompanying consultation in general practice in the United Kingdom (UK). Our hypothesis was that, for patients with asthma, switching inhaler device without a consultation is associated with worsened clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This 2-year retrospective matched cohort study included a baseline period of 1 year before the date of ICS device switch (index date) and an outcome period of 1 year after the index date. Patient data were drawn from 1990&#x02013;2004 records in the General Practice Research Database (GPRD), a large computerized database of anonymized longitudinal medical records from primary care in the Uk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The years of the switch and matched cohort analyzed in this study are 1992 to 2003. This database includes information for over 13 million patients, including 3.4 million active patients for whom data are currently being gathered. Reports for each patient include demographic data and event history, including date and type of event with a description of the event and the corresponding code. Information about the reason for a switch in device is not recorded. Ethical approval was received from the GPRD Scientific and Ethical Advisory Committee (Protocol 706R, 26.4.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Patients eligible for inclusion in this analysis were receiving ICS, were 6&#x02013;65 years of age on the index date, and had a recorded diagnosis of asthma and no record of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We used the GPRD to identify primary care practices where ICS inhaler devices were switched without an accompanying consultation on the same day for five or more patients within a 3-month period. Patients had to be registered at the practice for at least 1 year before and 1 year after the index date. We included switches to inhaler devices that require training to use, namely, from a dry powder inhaler to a metered-dose inhaler, another brand of dry powder inhaler, or a breath-actuated inhaler or from a breath-actuated to a metered-dose inhaler or another brand of breath-actuated inhaler. Patients changed to a device recorded as 'generic' were excluded.</p><p>Each patient included in the analysis was individually matched to another patient (from any practice) who was receiving the same ICS device on the index date and met the following six criteria: same sex, age within 5 years, same smoking status, match on presence or absence of rhinitis history, and, during the prior year, same number of oral corticosteroid prescriptions and hospitalizations for asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcome measures were analyzed for the year before (baseline period or year 1) and the year after the index date (outcome period or year 2). The primary outcome measure was a composite measure of asthma control, as defined in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Secondary outcome measures included several individual elements of asthma-related health resource utilization. The number of prescriptions/patient per year was analyzed for inhaled short-acting &#x003b2;-agonist and oral corticosteroids; in addition, the number of doses/day of short-acting &#x003b2;-agonist was determined for each patient based on the number of inhalers prescribed/year and an assumed standard dose of salbutamol 200 &#x003bc;g and terbutaline 500 &#x003bc;g. We also analyzed the number of general practice consultations (physician and practice nurse) for asthma, the number of hospital admissions for asthma, and the number of hospital admissions for possible asthma, which were defined as nonspecific hospitalization code and asthma-related code within a 1-week window.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Definition of asthma control &#x02013; a composite measure &#x02013; over 12 months</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="3">Assessment of Asthma Control*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Criterion for the Composite Measure</td><td align="center">Successful Treatment<break/>(All Criteria)</td><td align="center">Partially Successful Treatment<break/>(All Criteria)</td><td align="center">Unsuccessful Treatment<break/>(&#x02265; 1 Criterion)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Mean SABA dose</td><td align="center">&#x02264;0.5 dose/day</td><td align="center">0.5 to &#x02264;2 doses/day</td><td align="center">&#x0003e;2 doses/day</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Oral corticosteroid use/yr</td><td align="center">None</td><td align="center">&#x02264;2 courses</td><td align="center">&#x02265;3 courses</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Controller therapy</td><td align="center">Not changed</td><td align="center">Not changed</td><td align="center">Changed</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hospitalization&#x02020;</td><td align="center">None</td><td align="center">None</td><td align="center">&#x02265;1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>SABA = short-acting &#x003b2;-agonist; 1 daily dose = salbutamol 200 &#x003bc;g or terbutaline 500 &#x003bc;g.</p><p>*Successful and partially successful treatment had to meet each criterion, while unsuccessful treatment could be defined by any one or more of the criteria.</p><p>&#x02020;This includes any hospital attendance for asthma, including admission, emergency department, or outpatient department (hospital clinic) attendance.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Other data recorded for each patient included assigned socioeconomic status of the primary care practice and other respiratory or confounding diagnoses.

Similarly, there was no significant difference in asthma consultation rate between patients in switched and matched cohorts. Between year 1 and year 2, consultation rates fell slightly by a mean of 0.09 (SD, 1.33) in the switched cohort and by 0.35 (SD, 1.59) in the matched cohort. Thus, as compared with the baseline period, the switched cohort had 0.26 more asthma consultations in the outcome period than the matched cohort (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.40; p &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>There were very few hospitalizations for asthma during the study. Moreover, there was no significant difference between cohorts in admissions for possible asthma (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>) or in the change from baseline to outcome periods in admissions for possible asthma.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Switches in ICS device without clinical visit or consultation were associated with worsened asthma control in this retrospective analysis of a large UK general practice database. Patients whose ICS device was switched were significantly less likely to experience successful asthma treatment and significantly more likely to experience unsuccessful treatment than matched controls whose ICS device had not been switched. When possible baseline confounding factors were incorporated into the analysis, there was an even stronger association of device switch with lack of treatment success: patients with switched ICS device had less than one third the chance of successful treatment and were almost twice as likely to experience unsuccessful treatment or another change in ICS device compared with matched controls.</p><p>Use of short-acting &#x003b2;-agonist, a marker for asthma morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], increased significantly in the year after switching among patients in the switched cohort relative to controls. The number of hospitalizations for asthma and the number of oral corticosteroid prescriptions were, however, similar in the two cohorts during year 2.</p><p>We were able to identify over 100,000 individuals in the database who had undergone a switch in ICS device, and from these numbers were able to identify 55 practices where five or more patients had been switched in a 3-month period without a consultation, confirming our clinical impression that switching of ICS devices without a consultation is not an uncommon occurrence. While it is possible that some consultations occurred but were not recorded, given the multiple switching in these practices it is unlikely that the cases of switch without consultation are falsely identified. ICS device switching is typically implemented as a cost-saving measure. Indeed, in this study, the most common type of switch was from a dry powder inhaler to a metered-dose inhaler, often the cheapest inhaler device. Our study results would suggest, however, that the potential for worsened asthma control, and subsequent associated costs, may outweigh any acquisition cost savings from the switch.</p><p>Worsening asthma control after ICS device switching without a consultation could occur because of inadequate dosing secondary to poor technique or because of reduced patient adherence to therapy. Correct inhalation technique is necessary for attaining the full benefits of ICS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] However, inhaler devices are difficult to use, especially the metered-dose inhalers, which typically require the most patient instruction on their use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, patient education and involvement in treatment decisions can improve adherence to therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; thus, it is possible that, without a clinical consultation, adherence was reduced in the switched cohort and asthma control worsened.</p><p>There are no other studies, to our knowledge, evaluating the switching of inhaler devices without a consultation. Surveys of the attitudes of health-care professionals and patients about the interchangeability of dry powder inhalers have consistently reported a generally negative attitude about switching dry powder inhalers without input from patient and physician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>This retrospective matched cohort study drew on data from a large clinical database and as such is limited by the completeness and accuracy of that database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The GPRD is a very large primary care database that is managed with regular quality control and is considered to be valid for respiratory epidemiological research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In theory, however, findings of statistical significance, but not necessarily clinical significance, can emerge from the evaluation of large data sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We limited our study population to 824 patients who could be individually matched to control patients using quite restrictive criteria. The parameters that were different at baseline for the two cohorts (short-acting &#x003b2;-agonist use, asthma consultations, and socioeconomic status) were included as factors in the regression model.</p><p>We chose a composite measure of asthma control to assess the impact of device switching because multiple outcome measures are the best means of determining effectiveness of asthma therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The composite measures incorporated several measures of asthma morbidity, including daily short-acting &#x003b2;-agonist dose, change in asthma controller therapy, oral corticosteroid use, and hospitalization for asthma. Inclusion of lung function tests would have been impractical for this kind of study, as lung function tests are often not performed in primary care and are limited in interpretation by ceiling effects. The inclusion of OCS courses and hospitalizations means that a measure of severity was used to match patients, and surrogate measures of severity were entered into the regression model to reduce confounding.</p><p>There are a number of possible future studies given the findings of this analysis. The impact of age (child compared with adult) and long acting beta agonists are two possible sub-group analyses. However, care would need to be taken not to decrease the size of the cohort such that the power of the study becomes too weak to make conclusions from the findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, switching of ICS inhaler devices without a consultation is most commonly used for substitution of a cheaper metered-dose inhaler in place of a dry powder inhaler. Switching ICS inhaler devices without a consultation was associated with worsened asthma control. Therefore, the possible costs of adverse effects on asthma control should be weighed against savings in acquisition costs before instituting mass switching of ICS inhaler devices. Switching ICS inhaler devices without a face-to-face evaluation and consultation is inadvisable.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CI: confidence interval; COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; GPRD: General Practice Research Database; ICS: inhaled corticosteroid; IQR: interquartile range; OR: odds ratio; SABA: short-acting &#x003b2;-agonist; UK: United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>MT has received speaker honoraria from GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Sharp &#x00026; Dohme, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and advisory panel honoraria from GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Sharp &#x00026; Dohme, Teva, and Schering-Plough.
