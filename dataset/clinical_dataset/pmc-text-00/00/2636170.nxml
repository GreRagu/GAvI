The goal of this study was to identify probable effectsof occupational tobacco exposure among south Indian bidi-industry workers. This study included 310 females (mean age,34.8 &#x000b1; 10.9 years) actively involved in bidi-rolling presenting witheye symptoms to a tertiary eye care hospital. Results suggestedthat a wide spectrum of ocular complications exist among theseworkers. Common ocular symptoms were defective vision, dull-aching headache and eye irritation. The main ocular findingswere papillary conjunctival hyperplasia, hyperpigmentation ofocular surface, punctate epithelial erosion or superficial punctatekeratitis, cataract or pseudophakia and segmental optic atrophy.Abstaining from work, supplementation of Vitamin B complexrich in B<sub> 12</sub>  and appropriate surgical or medical managementreversed visual loss due to corneal disease or cataract but was noteffective in optic neuropathy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ocular manifestations of tobacco</kwd><kwd>tobacco industry workers</kwd><kwd>tobacco occupational exposure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Tobacco-related industry is a major commercial enterprisearound the world.
