Here, we show that cell viability decreases in osteoblasts treated with caffeine in a dose-dependent manner. This cell death is attributed primarily to apoptosis and to a smaller extent, necrosis. Moreover, caffeine directly stimulates intracellular oxidative stress. Our data support caffeine-induced apoptosis in osteoblasts via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. The apoptotic biochemical changes were effectively prevented upon pretreatment with ROS scavengers, indicating that ROS plays a critical role as an upstream controller in the caffeine-induced apoptotic cascade. Additionally, p21-activated protein kinase 2 (PAK2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were activated in caffeine-treated osteoblasts. Experiments further found that PAK2 activity is required for caffeine-induced JNK activation and apoptosis. Importantly, our data also show that caffeine triggers cell death via inactivation of the survival signal, including the ERK- and Akt-mediated anti-apoptotic pathways. Finally, exposure of rats to dietary water containing 10~20 &#x003bc;M caffeine led to bone mineral density loss. These results demonstrate for the first time that caffeine triggers apoptosis in osteoblasts via activation of mitochondria-dependent cell death signaling and inactivation of the survival signal, and causes bone mineral density loss <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>caffeine</kwd><kwd>ROS</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>necrosis</kwd><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Caffeine and its related methyl xanthine products are widely distributed in plants, and people consume caffeine beverages every day. Common sources of caffeine include coffee, cocoa beans, cola nuts and tea leaves. Caffeine is probably the most commonly consumed pharmacologically active compound in the world, particularly in Europe and North America. Each cup of tea, coffee, cocoa and cola contains 70 mg, 192 mg, 5 mg and 40 mg of caffeine, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-5-698">1</xref>]. The caffeine level is estimated as 21.22 &#x003bc;M in the blood circulation of people imbibing 2427 mg caffeine for 36 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-5-698">1</xref>]. However, it is difficult to determine the exact physiological concentration of caffeine. The use of caffeine as a risk factor for bone loss is currently a subject of controversy. Earlier studies disclose a negative effect of caffeine on calcium economy and caffeine-induced urinary calcium loss by increased diuresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-5-698">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-9-5-698">3</xref>]. In addition, caffeine possibly increases the risk of osteoporosis, as deduced from the decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-9-5-698">4</xref>], increase in hip fracture risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-9-5-698">5</xref>], and negative effects on calcium retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-9-5-698">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-9-5-698">7</xref>]. While several studies show that caffeine-containing beverage consumption is associated with reduced bone mass and increased fracture risk, the precise mechanisms by which caffeine induces osteoporosis remain to be elucidated.</p><p>The cytotoxicity of caffeine may be due to its ability to trigger apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijms-9-5-698">8</xref>]. A number of cysteine proteases, known as caspases, play important roles in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-9-5-698">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-5-698">10</xref>], similar to members of the Bcl-2 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-9-5-698">11</xref>], which regulate mitochondrial membrane potential changes and the release of cytochrome C by modulating the outer mitochondrial membrane permeability. Moreover, changes in protein kinase activity are observed during apoptosis in a variety of cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-5-698">12</xref>], indicating that phosphorylation is involved in cell death regulation. In particular, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) acts as a key component that regulates entry into apoptosis in several cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-5-698">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-9-5-698">15</xref>]. In addition to JNK, p21-activated kinase (PAK) is activated during apoptosis, and may also be involved in signaling events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-9-5-698">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-9-5-698">20</xref>]. While the direct downstream substrates of PAKs are largely unknown, recent studies suggest that these proteins act as upstream regulators of JNK and p38 MAPK pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijms-9-5-698">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijms-9-5-698">22</xref>].</p><p>HSP90, a 90 kDa isoform of the HSP family proteins, acts in concert with other chaperones and partners to facilitate the maturation and folding of client proteins via formation of a HSP90/multi-chaperone complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijms-9-5-698">23</xref>]. Two HSP90 client proteins, Raf-1 and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), are components of the Ras/extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway that is involved in both proliferation and anti-apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijms-9-5-698">24</xref>]. The second most important anti-apoptotic pathway involves Akt/PKB, another HSP90 client protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijms-9-5-698">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijms-9-5-698">26</xref>]. The protective effect of Akt against apoptosis could be attributed to the modulation of mitochondria-dependent bcl-2 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ijms-9-5-698">27</xref>]. However, there are no documented reports on the effects of caffeine on ERK- or Akt/PKB-mediated survival signaling in osteoporosis.</p><p>To elucidate the precise regulatory mechanisms of caffeine-triggered cytotoxicity in osteoporosis, we examined the effects of caffeine on human osteoblasts. Based on the present results, we propose a model of caffeine-induced cell injury signaling in osteoblasts. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments showed that caffeine consumption causes bone mineral density loss in an animal assay model, possibly as a result of cytotoxicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results|discussion"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><p>Previous studies show that caffeine induces various cell responses, including cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijms-9-5-698">28</xref>]. However, the effects of caffeine on osteoblasts and osteoporosis are currently unclear. The potential cytotoxicity of caffeine was examined by determining the viability of human osteoblasts treated with various doses of the compound, using the MTT assay. Osteoblasts were incubated in medium containing 0&#x02013;2 mM caffeine for 24 h. The viability of treated osteoblasts was decreased by approximately 10&#x02013;35% at concentrations higher than 0.5 mM caffeine in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 1A</xref>). We further investigated whether caffeine-induced cell death represents apoptosis or necrosis. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased significantly in cultures exposed to &#x0003e;0.5 mM caffeine, and the necrotic cell population simultaneously increased at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-5-698">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-5-698">C</xref>). These results indicate that treatment with caffeine triggers two cell death modes in osteoblasts, primarily apoptosis, and to a smaller extent, necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-5-698">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-5-698">C</xref>). In addition, the DNA content of various cell cycle phases was determined by flow cytometry analysis of propidium iodide-labeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 1D</xref>). The decline in osteoblast survival ratio following treatment with caffeine was attributed to the simultaneous occurrence of G1 arrest, apoptosis and necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-5-698">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-5-698">1D</xref>).</p><p>There is no documented evidence to show that caffeine directly provokes oxidative stress in cells. However, several reports demonstrate that ROS are effective cell injury inducers, leading to apoptosis and necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijms-9-5-698">29</xref>]. Therefore, we examined whether ROS formation occurs in caffeine-treated osteoblasts by immunostaining analysis with DCF-DA as the detection reagent. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 2A</xref>, treatment with 0&#x02013;2 mM caffeine for 24 h enhanced the intracellular ROS content in osteoblasts. ROS generation was additionally measured with DCF-DA and DHR-123 fluorescence dyes using the fluorescence ELISA reader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, ROS generation can detect when cells treatment with caffeine for more than 1 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 2C</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that caffeine directly induces ROS generation in osteoblasts.</p><p>The protein expression ratio of Bax versus Bcl-2 is relevant to apoptosis. Specifically, a high Bax/Bcl-2 ratio is associated with a lower threshold of apoptosis, while a low ratio represents a higher apoptotic threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijms-9-5-698">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijms-9-5-698">31</xref>]. Here, we investigate whether caffeine induces apoptosis by modulating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, the major effectors of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Immunoblotting revealed that treatment of osteoblasts with more than 0.5 mM caffeine triggered an increase in Bax and decrease in Bcl-2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 3A</xref>). Densitometric analysis quantitatively revealed that caffeine-treated osteoblasts have a higher Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, favoring apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Bax and Bcl-2 regulate changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and permeability, which play important roles in apoptotic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijms-9-5-698">32</xref>]. As mitochondrial membrane potential change is directly associated with apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijms-9-5-698">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijms-9-5-698">35</xref>], we further investigated the effects of caffeine on this parameter. Treatment of osteoblasts with caffeine decreased DiOC6(3) and TMRE uptake into mitochondria, indicating that caffeine induces significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, we also found that loss of MMP was detectable when cells treatment with caffeine for more than 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 3D</xref>). Our findings support the theory that caffeine triggers apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway.</p><p>Caspases play important roles in apoptosis, and their activation is critical in biochemical changes for cell death analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-9-5-698">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-5-698">10</xref>]. For identifying the signaling pathways involved in caffeine-induced cell death, we used an immunoblotting assay to monitor the levels of caspases-9 and -3, which are activated during the apoptosis of multiple cell types triggered by various stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijms-9-5-698">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ijms-9-5-698">37</xref>]. Treatment of osteoblasts with caffeine stimulated caspase-9 and -3 activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-5-698">Figures 4A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-5-698">4D</xref>). The activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 were detectable when cells treatment with caffeine for more than 9 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-5-698">4D</xref>). Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) is a key participant in DNA base excision repair. Apoptosis is accompanied by early and unique cleavage of PARP. The formation of a 89 kDa cleavage fragment resulting from the specific PARP cleavage pattern is a hallmark of apoptosis. Here, we show that PARP, a specific caspase-3 substrate, is cleaved in caffeine-treated osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 4E</xref>). Accordingly, we propose that caffeine-triggered apoptosis occurs via caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation.</p><p>To further clarify the role of ROS in caffeine-induced apoptosis, we assessed the effects of two commonly used ROS scavengers, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and &#x003b1;-tocopherol, on caffeine-treated osteoblasts. Pretreatment of cells with &#x003b1;-tocopherol (300 &#x003bc;M) or NAC (500 &#x003bc;M) attenuated caffeine-induced intracellular ROS generation, loss of MMP, and caspase-3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-5-698">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-5-698">B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-5-698">C</xref>). Based on the results, we propose that caffeine triggers ROS generation, which in turn activates mitochondria-dependent apoptotic processes in osteoblasts.</p><p>Previous studies show that p21-activated protein kinase 2 (PAK2) is activated during cell death, and may be involved in apoptotic signaling events, possibly via caspase-3-directed proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-5-698">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-9-5-698">20</xref>]. We investigated whether PAK2 cleavage/activation occurs in caffeine-treated osteoblasts. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation kinase activity assays revealed that caffeine induces PAK2 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 6A</xref>) and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 6B</xref>), respectively. Caspase-3 is activated during apoptosis of several cell types triggered by a variety of stimuli, including anti-Fas antibodies, TNF-&#x003b1;, and the chemotherapeutic agent, etoposide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijms-9-5-698">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ijms-9-5-698">37</xref>]. To elucidate the relationship between caspase-3 activation and PAK2 during caffeine-induced apoptosis, we examined the effects of the specific tetrapeptidic caspase inhibitors, Ac-DEVD-cho and Ac-YVAD-cmk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-5-698">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-9-5-698">20</xref>], on caffeine-treated osteoblasts. Caffeine-induced activation of caspase-3 was markedly suppressed upon pretreatment with either of the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 6C</xref>). Pretreatment with caspase inhibitors additionally blocked caffeine-induced PAK2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 6D</xref>), indicating that caspase-3 functions upstream of PAK2 in the apoptotic pathway.</p><p>Activation of JNK is essential for apoptotic induction in some cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-5-698">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-5-698">14</xref>], and in earlier investigations, we demonstrate that UV irradiation-, methylglyoxal-, and high glucose-induced apoptosis are mediated by JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ijms-9-5-698">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ijms-9-5-698">40</xref>]. Here, we use immunoblotting and ELISA assays to examine JNK activation during caffeine-induced apoptosis. JNK activity was stimulated in osteoblasts treated with caffeine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 7A</xref>). To further determine the relationship between JNK and PAK2 and the functional role of PAK2 in caffeine-induced apoptosis, we incubated osteoblasts with antisense or sense oligonucleotides against PAK2 for 3 days, subjected cells to caffeine treatment, and analyzed cell extracts by immunoblotting with anti-PAK2 (N17) antibodies and immunoprecipitation. Pre-incubation of osteoblasts with an antisense oligonucleotide against PAK2 led to a significant decrease in PAK2 protein levels (by ~40%), compared to untreated controls, whereas the sense oligonucleotide had no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 7B</xref>). Similarly, cells treated with the antisense PAK2 oligonucleotide displayed PAK2 activation levels that were approximately 40% those of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 7B</xref>). These reductions in PAK2 protein expression and activation were associated with a significant decrease in caffeine-induced activation of JNK and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-5-698">Figures 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-5-698">7D</xref>). Furthermore, activation of JNK was markedly reduced in the presence of the caspase-3 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 7E</xref>). However, caspase inhibitors had no effects on ROS generation in caffeine-treated osteoblasts (data not shown). Our findings support the theory that ROS generation is an upstream regulator of sequential apoptotic biochemical changes, such as caspase activation. The data strongly suggest that PAK2 activation plays an important role in caffeine-induced JNK activation and apoptosis of osteoblasts.</p><p>Analysis of the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 7</xref> reveals that the decreased ratios of PAK2 (~57%) and JNK activity (~54%) are higher than that of apoptosis inhibition (~36% decrease) in caffeine-treated cells. This finding indicates that other regulatory mechanisms are additionally involved in caffeine-induced apoptosis in osteoblasts.</p><p>Survival signaling processes protect against apoptosis induced by specific stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ijms-9-5-698">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ijms-9-5-698">42</xref>]. Our group and others have demonstrated that some apoptotic stimuli inhibit the Ras&#x02192;ERK survival signal pathway by decreasing the protein levels of various survival components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijms-9-5-698">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ijms-9-5-698">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ijms-9-5-698">43</xref>]. Based on these results, we evaluated the effects of caffeine on the cell survival signal pathway, including activities of components critical for the Ras&#x02192;ERK-dependent and PI3 Kinase&#x02192;Akt survival signal pathways. Our results show that caffeine triggers a decrease in the protein levels of HSP90, Ras, Raf-1, and Akt, and inhibition of ERK and Akt activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 8A</xref>). In addition, inhibition of protein expression or activities of these survival signal components by caffeine could be effectively blocked by pretreatment with lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor, and NAC, a potent ROS scavenger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 8A</xref>). Moreover, lactacystin and NAC prevented caffeine-induced cell apoptosis, which correlates the blocking of survival signal components decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijms-9-5-698">Figures 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijms-9-5-698">B</xref>). These data imply that Ras, Raf-1, and Akt are degraded by ROS and proteasome-dependent pathways in caffeine-treated osteoblasts, subsequently reducing ERK and Akt activities for cell apoptosis.</p><p>Lastly, we analyzed whether the apoptotic effect of caffeine on osteoblasts induces bone density injury <italic>in vivo</italic>. Wistar rats were fed a standard diet supplemented with or without caffeine (10 or 20 &#x003bc;M) in drinking water for 8 months. Initial body weights were similar among the control and caffeine-treated groups, and did not differ significantly at the end of the 8-month experimental period (data not shown). However, the bone mineral densities (BMD) of whole femurs and distal femurs from rats in the caffeine-treated groups were significantly lower than those in the control (caffeine-free) group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 9</xref>). These results suggest that elevated caffeine levels, resulting from continuous long-term consumption of high caffeine-containing foods, negatively affect BMD, an important osteoporosis indicator.</p><p>Substantial amounts of caffeine are ingested by people drinking coffee, tea or caffeinated soft drinks. While the consumption of caffeine-containing beverages is associated with significantly increased osteoporosis risk, its precise role and regulatory mechanisms in bone loss and fracture risk are currently unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ijms-9-5-698">44</xref>]. Our current results provide evidence that the apoptotic and necrotic properties of caffeine contribute to bone loss and osteoporosis in osteoblasts. The majority of caffeine-treated cells die via apoptotic processes through ROS generation and a mitochondria-mediated pathway, while a minor proportion of cell death occurs through necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-5-698">Figures 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-5-698">3</xref>).</p><p>Oxidative stress is a stimulator of cell responses such as apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijms-9-5-698">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ijms-9-5-698">45</xref>]. Importantly, caffeine directly induced oxidative stress in osteoblasts in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, pretreatment with antioxidants effectively prevented ROS-induced apoptotic biochemical changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 4</xref>). Several reports show that ROS is an important upstream regulator of JNK and caspase activation during UV-, methylglyoxal-, and osmotic shock-induced apoptosis in various mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ijms-9-5-698">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ijms-9-5-698">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-ijms-9-5-698">46</xref>]. These results, coupled with our findings, strongly imply that oxidative injury plays a pivotal role in caffeine-induced apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanisms of caffeine-triggered ROS formation remain to be established. The effects of caffeine on target cells may depend, at least in part, on cell type and treatment protocol (i.e., treatment period and dosage).</p><p>Mitochondria act as important conduits for signals during programmed cell death, and loss of mitochondrial integrity can be promoted or inhibited by several key regulators of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ijms-9-5-698">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-ijms-9-5-698">48</xref>]. For instance, various cellular stress conditions, including heat shock, DNA damage and oxidative stress, result in caspase activation through cytochrome c release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-ijms-9-5-698">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ijms-9-5-698">49</xref>]. We examined Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression and MMP changes, with a view to further elucidating the precise mechanisms of caffeine-induced apoptosis. Caffeine triggered an increase in Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression and loss of MMP in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-5-698">Figures 3A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-5-698">3C</xref>). Moreover, caspases-9 and -3 were activated in the presence of caffeine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, caffeine induced ROS generation and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 at concentrations higher than 0.5 mM, but had no effects on MMP changes or the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio at 0.5 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-5-698">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-5-698">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-5-698">4</xref>). These ambiguous results may be affected by the different assay sensitivities of various methods or assay kits. To elucidate the underlying reasons for these conflicting results, we further analyzed Bax and Bcl-2 mRNA levels by real-time PCR. Our analyses revealed that caffeine treatment of osteoblasts led to increased and decreased Bax and Bcl-2 expression levels at concentrations higher than 0.5 mM, respectively (data not shown). Thus, apoptotic biochemical changes, such as ROS generation, MMP changes, and activation of caspases appear to be correlated. In addition, inhibition of ROS generation by antioxidants was associated with a decrease in caffeine-triggered mitochondria-dependent apoptotic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 5</xref>). Accordingly, we propose that ROS act as important regulators of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic processes promoted by caffeine.</p><p>Recently, coworkers of our laboratory and other researchers showed that PAK2 is a target substrate for caspases activated by various apoptotic stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-9-5-698">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijms-9-5-698">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ijms-9-5-698">50</xref>]. However, the functional role of the caspase-generated C-terminal active fragment of PAK2 remains obscure. Our group showed that decreases in PAK2 protein expression and activation are associated with significant inhibition of methylglyoxal-induced apoptosis in human osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijms-9-5-698">30</xref>], strongly suggesting that PAK2 plays an important role in apoptosis by methylglyoxal. Here, we demonstrate the PAK2 is an important upstream regulator of JNK activation in caffeine-directed apoptosis of osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-9-5-698">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-5-698">7</xref>). JNK evidently plays critical roles in apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-5-698">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-9-5-698">15</xref>]. Moreover, inhibition of caspase-3 blocks activation of PAK2 and JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-9-5-698">Figures 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-9-5-698">6D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-5-698">7E</xref>). Based on these results, we propose that caffeine triggers caspase-3 activation, which in turn induces cleavage/activation of PAK2 and sequential activation of JNK, consequently leading to apoptosis.</p><p>Heat-shock proteins (HSP) protect proteins against proteasome- and ubiquitin-dependent degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ijms-9-5-698">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-ijms-9-5-698">52</xref>]. HSP90, the most abundant molecular chaperone protein in the intracellular system, is involved in maintaining the correct conformation of intracellular proteins and kinases, such as Raf-1 and Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-ijms-9-5-698">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-ijms-9-5-698">54</xref>], which regulate cell proliferation and survival. Here, we show that caffeine-induced apoptosis is associated with reduced expression of survival components, including Ras, Raf-1, and Akt. Moreover, inactivation of ERK-1, ERK-2 and Akt/PKB, and pretreatment with lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor, may prevent these decreases in protein level or activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 8A</xref>). Caffeine suppresses HSP90 expression, thus promoting the degradation of client proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 8A</xref>). Accordingly, we hypothesize that the caffeine-induced reduction of HSP90 stimulates Ras, Raf-1 and Akt targeting for degradation, leading to their downregulation and changes in the related signal pathways. In view of these findings, the following pathway is proposed: caffeine decreases HSP90 expression, leading to increased degradation of Ras, Raf-1 and Akt/PKB, with decreased Raf-1 levels resulting in ERK-1 and ERK-2 downregulation and subsequent cell apoptosis. ROS generation is additionally involved in caffeine-induced suppression of the levels of survival signal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijms-9-5-698">Figures 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijms-9-5-698">B</xref>). Thus, it appears that ROS act as upstream negative regulators of Ras&#x02192;ERK and PI3K&#x02192;Akt/PKB survival signals in caffeine-induced apoptosis. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms require further investigation.</p><p>Lastly, given the ability of caffeine to induce apoptosis or cell injury in osteoblasts <italic>in vitro</italic>, we examined its effects on bone density in an animal assay model. Rats administered 10 or 20 &#x003bc;M caffeine in the drinking water for 8 months displayed significantly decreased bone mineral density (BMD), compared to untreated control rats, further signifying that caffeine consumption negatively affects bone density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 9</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>3. Conclusions</title><p>Recent study by our group found that the common signaling pathway in caffeine-stimulated cell injury occurs not only in the human osteoblast cell line, but also mouse osteoblast primary cultures and cell lines. The current results establish that caffeine-induced ROS trigger cell injury through apoptosis, necrosis and inactivation of survival signal components. In addition, a time-course study of various apoptotic biochemical changes indicates that ROS act as upstream regulators for MMP loss, which further triggers caspase activation for sequential apoptotic processes, such as activation of PAK2 and JNK. Based on these findings, we propose a model of caffeine-induced cell injury signaling in osteoblasts and possible effects on osteoporosis (specified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10-ijms-9-5-698">Figure 10</xref>). Our findings provide preliminary evidence that high consumption of caffeine is a significant risk factor in osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec><title>4.
