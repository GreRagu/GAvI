On the other hand, cAMP has been demonstrated to induce a Th2 bias when present during T cell priming, suggesting that bacterial cAMP elevating toxins may directly affect the Th1/Th2 balance. Here we have investigated the effects on human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell differentiation of two adenylate cyclase toxins, <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> edema toxin (ET) and <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> CyaA, which differ in structure, mode of cell entry, and subcellular localization. We show that low concentrations of ET and CyaA, but not of their genetically detoxified adenylate cyclase defective counterparts, potently promote Th2 cell differentiation by inducing expression of the master Th2 transcription factors, c-maf and GATA-3. We also present evidence that the Th2&#x02013;polarizing concentrations of ET and CyaA selectively inhibit TCR&#x02013;dependent activation of Akt1, which is required for Th1 cell differentiation, while enhancing the activation of two TCR&#x02013;signaling mediators, Vav1 and p38, implicated in Th2 cell differentiation. This is at variance from the immunosuppressive toxin concentrations, which interfere with the earliest step in TCR signaling, activation of the tyrosine kinase Lck, resulting in impaired CD3&#x003b6; phosphorylation and inhibition of TCR coupling to ZAP-70 and Erk activation. These results demonstrate that, notwithstanding their differences in their intracellular localization, which result in focalized cAMP production, both toxins directly affect the Th1/Th2 balance by interfering with the same steps in TCR signaling, and suggest that their adjuvanticity is likely to result from their combined effects on APC and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Furthermore, our results strongly support the key role of cAMP in the adjuvanticity of these toxins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Colonization by pathogens requires keeping at bay the host immune defenses, at least at the onset of infection. The adenylate cyclase (AC) toxins produced by many pathogenic bacteria assist in this crucial function by catalyzing the production of cAMP, which acts as a potent immunosuppressant. Nevertheless, at low concentrations, these toxins act as adjuvants, enhancing antibody responses to vaccination. We have investigated the molecular basis of the immunomodulatory activities of two AC toxins, <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> edema toxin and <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> CyaA. We show that high toxin concentrations inhibit activation of T lymphocytes, which orchestrate the adaptive immune response against pathogens, whereas low toxin concentrations promote differentiation of helper T lymphocytes to Th2 effectors, which are required for development of antibody-producing cells. Both the immunosuppressant and Th2&#x02013;driving activities of the toxins are dependent on cAMP. The results demonstrate that, dependent on their concentration, the AC toxins of <italic>B. anthracis</italic> and <italic>B. pertussis</italic> evoke distinct responses on target T lymphocytes by differentially modulating antigen receptor signaling, resulting either in suppression of T cell activation or Th2 cell differentiation. These results are of relevance to the evolution of disease in infected individuals and provide novel mechanistic insight into the adjuvanticity of these toxins.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Development of an effective humoral immune response is crucially dependent on T cell help. The last step of B cell differentiation, involving immunoglobulin affinity maturation and isotype switching, occurs in peripheral lymphoid organs under the guidance of a specialized CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell subset, known as T helper 2 (Th2). These cells provide both soluble (IL-4) and membrane-bound (CD40L) factors essential for terminal differentiation of antigen specific B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000325-Abbas1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Additional factors present during T cell priming may profoundly affect the developmental program of helper T cells.

As a readout of PKA activation we used an antibody specific for the phosphorylated PKA consensus, R-X-X-pT-X-X/R-R-X-pS-X-X, which recognizes phosphorylated PKA substrates. The increase in intracellular cAMP following T cell treatment with high concentrations of ET or CyaA resulted in a strong potentiation of PKA activity, as shown by the qualitative and quantitative changes in the phosphoprotein pattern in lysates from toxin-treated cells compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000325-g002">Figure 2B, top panel</xref>). A similar enhancement in PKA activity was also observed in cells treated with low concentrations of ET or CyaA, despite the smaller increase in intracellular cAMP measured under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000325-g002">Figure 2B, top panel</xref>). Interestingly, notwithstanding the different interacellular localization of the two adenylate cyclase toxins, there was a general overlap in the phosphoprotein pattern observed in cells treated with ET or CyaA. Consistent with the agonistic activity of ET and CyaA on PKA, analysis of the phosphorylation state of the transcriptional activator CREB, a specific PKA substrate, showed that low toxin concentrations induced CREB phosphorylation, albeit to a lesser extent compared to high toxin concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000325-g002">Figure 2B, middle panel</xref>).

The inhibitory activity of high concentrations of ET and CyaA on Lck activation and CD3&#x003b6; phosphorylation indicates that these toxins preventing firing of the TCR signaling cascade by altering the cAMP balance through the massive and sustained production of cAMP. In this context, it should be underlined that TCR engagement results in a rapid elevation in the levels of cAMP, which elicit a potent enhancement in PKA activation, comparable to the one observed in cells exposed to high toxin concentrations. Nevertheless, under these conditions the TCR triggers a productive signaling cascade, as opposed to cells pre-exposed to high concentrations of ET or CyaA, supporting the importance of the spatiotemporal regulation of cAMP in TCR signaling. Low toxin concentrations on the other hand, do not inhibit initiation of TCR signaling. The intracellular concentration of cAMP measured under these conditions, which is very modest compared to the burst of cAMP evoked by the TCR, may be locally and transiently neutralized by PDE-4.</p><p>At variance with their inability to impair initiation of TCR signaling, low concentrations of ET or CyaA were found to selectively affect specific downstream nodes -Akt1, Vav1 and p38 activation- crucial to Th1/Th2 lineage committment.

CyaA is a single polypeptide which binds to target cells both directly and through a membrane receptor, which in macrophages and other APC is the integrin CD11b/CD18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000325-Guermonprez1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Following binding, the adenylate cyclase N-terminal domain is translocated accross the plasma membrane of target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000325-Vojtova1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence EF and CyaA produce cAMP not only with different kinetics, which is delayed for ET probably due to the multistep mechanism of delivery into host cells, but also at different subcellular locations, in the cytosol with a prevalent perinuclear localization, and close to the plasma membrane, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000325-DalMolin1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000325-Puhar1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of AKAPs in segregation of PKA pools at specific subcellular localizations and dynamic recruitment of phosphodiesterases underscores the importance of the spatiotemporal control of cAMP signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000325-McConnachie1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. By focalizing cAMP production at distinct sites within the cell, EF and CyaA could differentially affect early and late events in TCR signaling. Our findings indicate that the critical targets of the cAMP dependent Th2 polarizing activities of ET and CyaA can be activated independently of the subcellular site of cAMP production. It is likely that the sustained cAMP production overrides the negative local feedback mechanisms, resulting in loss of compartmentalization of cAMP dependent signaling. It should be however underlined that low ET concentrations are almost as effective as high concentrations in triggering PKA activation, suggesting that ET may modulate other functions, such as CREB mediated gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000325-DalMolin1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000325-Puhar1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, through activation of specific PKA pools.</p><p>Both ET and CyaA have been reported to potentiate antibody responses and development of antigen specific Th2 cells in mice when coadministered with antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000325-Ross1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000325-QuesnelHellmann1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.
