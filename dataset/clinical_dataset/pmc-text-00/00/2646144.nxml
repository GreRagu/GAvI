Streptococcal M-proteins have been implicated in ARF pathogenesis. Their interaction with collagen type IV (CIV) is a triggering step that induces generation of collagen-specific auto-antibodies. Electron microscopy of the protein complex between M-protein type 3 (M3-protein) and CIV identified two prominent binding sites of which one is situated in the CB3-region of CIV. In a radioactive binding assay, M3-protein expressing <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> and <italic>S. gordonii</italic> bound the CB3-fragment. Detailed analysis of the interactions by surface plasmon resonance measurements and site directed mutagenesis revealed high affinity interactions with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range that depend on the recently described collagen binding motif of streptococcal M-proteins. Because of its role in the induction of disease-related collagen autoimmunity the motif is referred to as &#x0201c;<underline>p</underline>eptide <underline>a</underline>ssociated with <underline>r</underline>heumatic <underline>f</underline>ever&#x0201d; (PARF). Both, sera of mice immunized with M3-protein as well as sera from patients with ARF contained anti-CB3 auto-antibodies, indicating their contribution to ARF pathogenesis. The identification of the CB3-region as a binding partner for PARF directs the further approaches to understand the unusual autoimmune pathogenesis of PARF-dependent ARF and forms a molecular basis for a diagnostic test that detects rheumatogenic streptococci.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) can occur as a sequela to inadequately treated infection with <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (group A streptococcus (GAS)), and it is one of the most serious outcomes of streptococcal disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004666-Cunningham1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Six genetically distinct alpha-chains of CIV exist, which assemble into hetero-trimers of different compositions. These molecules consist of a triple-helical domain that is flanked by non-collagenous domains, the N-terminal 7S domain and the C-terminal globular domain, referred to as NC1 (for schematic representation see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004666-vanderRest1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>). Both non-collagenous domains are involved in the formation of hexagonal networks that are the typical assembly of CIV in the basement membrane.

In this context, it is noteworthy that another CIV-dependent autoimmune disease, the Goodpasture Syndrome, is caused by exposure of cryptic epitopes to the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004666-Hudson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, which fosters the notion of similarities in the pathogenesis of collagen-dependent ARF. Hence, further examination of the structural influences that are exerted by the PARF-motif, when it is bound to CB3-region, promise insights that are fundamental for the understanding of collagen-dependent ARF.</p><p>Moreover, the identification of a smaller fragment of collagen as a receptor for PARF is a considerable step ahead in the development of a specific diagnostic test for rheumatogenic streptococcal strains.
