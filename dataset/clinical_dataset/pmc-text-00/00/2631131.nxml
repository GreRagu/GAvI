This parasite is endemic in Southeast Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, and on Pacific Islands. Moreover, the disease is emerging in mainland China, which might be related to the spread of two invasive snail species (<italic>Achatina fulica</italic> and <italic>Pomacea canaliculata</italic>). Thus far, the biggest angiostrongyliasis outbreak in China occurred in 2006 in Beijing, involving 160 patients. However, detailed information about the national distribution of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> and its intermediate hosts is still lacking, and the importance of the two invasive snail species for disease transmission is not well understood. Therefore, a national survey on the distribution of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> and its intermediate hosts in China was carried out in 2006/2007. It was found that <italic>A. fulica</italic> and <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> were implicated in most angiostrongyliasis outbreaks, and that the distribution of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> closely matched that of these snails. The two invasive snail species facilitated the expansion of the parasite, thus probably leading to the emergence of angiostrongyliasis, a previously rare disease, in mainland China.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eosinophilic meningitis, a potentially fatal disease caused by <italic>Angiostrongylus cantonensis</italic>, is considered an emerging infectious disease in mainland China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Lv1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Morse1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The first human case of angiostrongyliasis in mainland China was reported in 1978, and a few more cases were diagnosed until the mid-1990s. Subsequently, several outbreaks have been recorded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Lv1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The first major angiostrongyliasis outbreak, involving 65 patients, was documented from Wenzhou in Zhejiang province in 1997 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Zheng1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The biggest outbreak in China thus far could be attributed to a freshwater snail, i.e., <italic>Pomacea canaliculata</italic>, and took place in the capital Beijing in 2006 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-MacDonald1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Of the 160 infected individuals involved in this outbreak, 100 were hospitalized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-He1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This outbreak also demonstrated that angiostrongyliasis had moved beyond its traditional endemic areas located in the southeastern coastal regions of China.</p><p>The parasite was first described by Chen based on worm specimens collected from pulmonary arteries of rats in Guangzhou (Canton) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Chen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and Dougherty proposed the name <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> in 1946 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Murrell1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Adult <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> live in the pulmonary arteries of its definitive hosts, i.e., rodents, especially rats, which pass infective first-stage larvae (L<sub>1</sub>) in their feces. The life cycle also involves mollusks, harboring larval stages. In humans, larvae fail to mature, and hence humans and their excreta play no role in the transmission and direct dissemination of the parasite. Humans become infected by ingesting third-stage larvae (L<sub>3</sub>) in raw or undercooked intermediate host mollusks (e.g., snails and slugs) or paratenic hosts (e.g., freshwater prawns, crabs, frogs and fish) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Anderson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Lai1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Two snail species, i.e., <italic>Achatina fulica</italic> and <italic>P. canaliculata</italic>, are believed to be closely associated with angiostrongyliasis in China. These snails were imported into mainland China in 1931 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Mead1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Jarreit1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and 1981 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Lv1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Joshi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, respectively, and have rapidly extended their geographic ranges. Indeed, these two snails are now listed as invasive species by the Chinese government.</p><p>In response to the recent angiostrongyliasis outbreak in Beijing that had received considerable national and international attention and mass-media coverage, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of China launched the first national survey on <italic>A. cantonensis</italic>.

Considering that the distribution of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> is affected by several environmental and ecological factors, the potential distribution of the parasite was first determined. Temperature was selected as the main factor to predict the potential distribution of the parasite and two invasive snail species in China. Since revealing the distribution of both the parasite and two snail species implicated in its transmission was the main aim of this survey, the widest potential distribution of <italic>P. canaliculata</italic>, which has previously been regarded as the most important intermediate host, delineated the survey region. The potential range of <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> in China was predicted using a degree-day model based on temperature data obtained from 149 observing stations across China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Zhou1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. A grid with a spatial resolution of 40&#x000d7;40 km was laid over the predicted area, and approximately 5&#x00025; of the grid cells were randomly selected for sample collection. In each survey grid cell, one village was randomly selected for subsequent field work. The geographic coordinates of the survey villages were recorded using a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) device (GPSmap 70; Kansas, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Field survey of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> and its hosts</title><p>Rats are the definitive hosts of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic>.

Therefore, rats (e.g., <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>) and insectivores (Soricidae, e.g., <italic>Suncus murinus</italic>) were trapped in fields and in residents' houses.

Up to 100 specimens of each species were collected at each study site. The intermediate hosts were artificially digested using routine procedures (incubation in a solution containing 0.2&#x00025; pepsin and 0.7&#x00025; hydrochloric acid at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 h) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Lv2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

To date, more than 2,800 human cases have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Wang1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. It had been suggested that the parasite was dispersed from East Asia to other regions in two important hosts, i.e., rats (definitive host) and <italic>A. fulica</italic> (intermediate host) especially during World War II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Kliks1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Today, the parasite is still expanding its range and the associated disease is emerging in some regions, particularly China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Lv1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Prociv1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Caldeira1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The results of the first national survey on the distribution of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> and its hosts in China reported here indicate that there is a need for strengthening food safety inspections and food-borne disease surveillance. Long-distance trade, biological invasion and animal migration are contributing to the emergence of new diseases and the re-emergence of diseases that have previously been controlled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-McMichael1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Enserink1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Angiostrongyliasis in mainland China is an example of such an emerging food-borne disease. Its spread can be linked to the introduction, farming and consumption of certain snail species. Extrapolating from recent observations, the incidence of angiostrongyliasis is likely to further increase in China, although the 2006 outbreak in Beijing triggered considerable attention and a change in attitudes toward this parasitic infection not only in the medical and research community, but also the general public.</p><p>The results of the national survey can be summarized as follows. First, the <italic>A. cantonensis</italic>-endemic area is very wide, covering seven southern provinces. However, not a single snail or rat infected with <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> was found in Yunnan province. This observation comes as a surprise, since the parasite was first documented in Yunnan some 20 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Li1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, and several outbreaks have occurred subsequently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Han1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Wei1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, most recently in Dali (early 2008). Hence, Yunnan must clearly be considered a potentially endemic province.</p><p>Second, several freshwater and terrestrial snail species were found on local markets and in restaurants, and <italic>A. cantonensis</italic>-infected <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> and <italic>A. fulica</italic> clearly destined for human consumption were recorded. This observation suggests that the transmission of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> to humans is ongoing, and that the health education and awareness raising campaigns initiated after the 2006 outbreak in Beijing &#x02013; targeting consumers, health personnel and officials alike &#x02013; must be improved since they appeared to have failed yet to stop the sale and consumption of infected snails. It follows that the impact of the previous health education campaigns through mass media to change human behavior has probably been overestimated, because angiostrongyliasis outbreaks continued in Guangdong province in 2007 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Deng1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and Yunnan province in early-2008, involving six and 41 patients, respectively.</p><p>Third, culturally-routed dietary habits of certain ethnic groups increase the risk of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> infection. For example, the consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater snails is held responsible for the early-2008 angiostrongyliasis outbreak in Dali. As a direct consequence of the booming inland tourism in China, the interest in minority dishes is growing, and ethnic dining has become popular among tourists and wealthy urban residents alike. Travelers to endemic regions with a tradition of preparing snails for human consumption should be better informed about the risks associated with certain dishes, and food inspection and hygiene regulations need to be enforced.</p><p>Fourth, among the different factors facilitating the spread and transmission of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> in China, the two invasive mollusk species <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> and <italic>A. fulica</italic>, play a central role. A range of mollusks can serve as intermediate hosts of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> and were examined during the national survey. The prevalence of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> infection among <italic>P. canaliculata</italic>, <italic>A. fulica</italic> and terrestrial slugs was found to govern the endemicity of this parasite in China. However, terrestrial slugs had rarely been found to be associated with human angiostrongyliasis; the only exception being their occasional use in local traditional medicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Li2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Cross1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> and <italic>A. fulica</italic> are probably responsible for most angiostrongyliasis cases in China. Both snails not only expand their range, but also frequently go on the table for human consumption.</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> and <italic>A. fulica</italic> have facilitated the spread of the endemic area of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> rather than the introduction of a new pathogen. Man-made ecological transformations and climate change are important drivers of the spread of exotic species and their establishment in new areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-McMichael1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Bardsley1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Stachowicz1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. The emergence of several infectious diseases has already been attributed to the invasion of efficient vectors or hosts involved in their life cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Juliano1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. These two invasive snail species impact on the endemicity and transmission of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> in at least two ways. First, the invasion of these snails facilitates the establishment of the life cycle of the parasite and thus increases the chances for an exposure of native mollusks to <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> in existing endemic areas. Previous experiments indeed documented a superior susceptibility of these snails to <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> compared to native snails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Lv4">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, these invasive snails accelerate the spread of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> since they rapidly expand their range, resulting in the local establishment of the snail and &#x02013; sometimes &#x02013; the parasite life cycle in previously non-endemic areas.</p><p><italic>A. fulica</italic> was recorded for the first time in mainland China in 1931 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Jarreit1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been suggested that eggs of <italic>A. fulica</italic> were accidentally imported from Singapore with shipments of plants, and that an initial snail population became established in Xiamen (Amoy) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Mead1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These terrestrial snails are nocturnal and become active under high-humidity conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Barker1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. The snails feed on plants and deposit their eggs in the soil nearby. This behavior facilitates their dispersal through long-distance transportation of pot plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Mead1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Since their unintentional introduction, <italic>A. fulica</italic> spreads across southern China, probably facilitated by the rapid expansion of long-distance trade and an increasing demand for farmed plants going hand-in-hand with China's ongoing economic development. It has even been speculated that <italic>A. fulica</italic> invaded China more than once. For example, the snail populations in Yunnan province might derive from trade with Indochina (Mekong basin) rather than eastern China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Chen2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. The public health significance of <italic>A. fulica</italic> in mainland China was only noted when a parasitologically-confirmed case of angiostrongyliasis found in 1984 could be linked to this snail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-He3">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the consumption of <italic>A. fulica</italic> snails is generally less popular than that of <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> in mainland China.</p><p>The freshwater snail <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> was deliberately introduced into China for human consumption. The invasion process can be stratified into three stages, i.e., (i) introduction, (ii) establishment, and (iii) spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Jeschke1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. It was first imported into Zhongshan city in Guangdong province approximately 30 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Lv1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequently, the snail was farmed in most southern provinces with commercial aims <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Joshi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. However, within a few years, the snail also became established outside due to abandoning of farms and deliberate release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Joshi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Currently, the snails have reached 30&#x000b0; N latitude and had been found as high as 1,960 m above sea level in Yunnan province. It is conceivable that the dense river networks in eastern and southern China contributed to the dispersal of this snail. The isolated snail population in the Sichuan basin has expanded freely in this area for about 20 years. The easternmost natural colonies were observed in Zhoushan in Zhejiang province, suggesting a line from Zhoushan to the Sichuan basin south of which climate conditions are suitable for the snails to thrive. This line might move further northward as a consequence of global warming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Yang1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. The public health significance of <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> was emphasized by the first major angiostrongyliasis outbreak in Wenzhou in 1997 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Zheng1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The results of the national survey presented here suggest a close relationship between the endemicity of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> and the area where <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> breed two or even three generations per year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000368-Zhou1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> largely depends on this freshwater snail for its expansion in China. Although <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> in the whole endemic area of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> were found to be infected, point prevalences of infection are heterogeneous: two heavily endemic areas could be identified in the provinces of Fujian and Guangxi, respectively. The snail is indeed responsible for many sporadic cases recorded throughout Fujian province. However, it remains to be investigated why no angiostrongyliasis cases have been observed thus far in Guangxi province.</p><p>Although both <italic>A. fulica</italic> and <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> appear to have contributed to the emergence of angiostrongyliasis in China, several characteristics of <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> suggest that this species is mainly responsible for the spread of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic>. This claim is supported as follows. First, the aquatic <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> probably spread along waterways, accelerated through flooding events. This might partly explain why <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> more rapidly expanded its range than <italic>A. fulica</italic>, which appears to largely depend on human-facilitated transport. Second, the area colonized by <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> also expands far beyond that of <italic>A. fulica</italic> despite a considerably longer presence of the latter in China. Third, the consumption of <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> is more popular than that of <italic>A. fulica</italic>. During the national survey, for example, <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> was on sale in 21 counties, while <italic>A. fulica</italic> was only noted in three counties.</p><p>The national survey shed light on different important aspects regarding the distribution of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> and its hosts in China. The results indicate a need for more pointed attention to this emerging threat through awareness-raising campaigns among the medical community, the establishment of a hospital-based sentinel surveillance system, improved community-based health education and strengthening of food safety inspection. A number of pressing research questions could also be identified. For example, the model for predicting the prevalence of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> within <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> identified two high-prevalence clusters. However, the accuracy of this prediction has not been assessed since no ground truthing of the predictions has been made thus far. The small-scale distribution, the range of hosts and the host-parasite compatibility should also be investigated to deepen our understanding of the transmission dynamics.</p><p>In conclusion, the first national survey revealed the distribution of <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> and two invasive snail species, i.e., <italic>P. canaliculata</italic> and <italic>A. fulica</italic>, and the pivotal role of these invasive snails for the transmission of this parasite. The results of the survey also suggest that people are at risk of angiostrongyliasis through consumption of raw or undercooked snails infected with <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> that are found in many markets and restaurants. Continued health education, rigorous food inspection, and hospital-based surveillance are needed to prevent recurrent angiostrongyliasis outbreaks in China.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the institutions and authorities involved in the first national survey on <italic>A. cantonensis</italic> in China for their assistance.
