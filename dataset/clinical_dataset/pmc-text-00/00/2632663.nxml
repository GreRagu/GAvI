The aims of this study were to firstly assess the baseline prevelences and the risk factors for overweight and obesity, and secondly to detect the changes of body mass index (BMI) over a follow-up period in Chinese adults in Shanghai.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The data set of a population-based longitudinal study was analyzed. Anthropometric and biochemical data were collected for 5364 subjects (aged 25&#x02013;95 years) during a period of 1998&#x02013;2001. Among those individuals, 3032 subjects were interviewed and reexamined at the second survey from 2003 to 2004. Then the standardized prevalences for overweight and obesity were calculated using baseline data; the possible contributing factors of overweight and obesity were detected using binary logistic regression analysis; and the changes of BMI were evaluated after an average of 3.6-year follow-up period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>(1) According to the WHO standard and the Chinese standard, the sex- and age-standardized prevalences were 27.5% and 32.4% for overweight, and 3.7% and 9.1% for obesity, respectively. (2) The risks of overweight and obesity differed among different age groups. Family history of obesity increased the risk of overweight and obesity by about 1.2-fold for both genders. Current male smokers had a lower risk of overweight and obesity (OR = 0.76, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) than nonsmokers. In contrast, current male drinkers had a higher risk of overweight and obesity (OR = 1.42, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) than nondrinkers. Compared with low-educated women, medium- and high- educated women were at lower risk of overweight and obesity, and the corresponding ORs (95% CIs) were 0.64 (0.52&#x02013;0.79) and 0.50(0.36&#x02013;0.68), respectively. (3) The annual changes of BMI means ranged from an increase of 0.1 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>to a decrease of 0.2 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>(by genders and age groups). Meanwhile, the BMI increase was statistically significant in the 35&#x02013;44 years age group, and the BMI decrease was significant above 65 years for both genders.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed high prevalence of overweight and obesity in Shanghai metropolis populations. The risk factors of overweight and obesity were multifactorial and gender specific. After 3.6 years, BMI means changed slightly, BMI increased mainly in middle-aged individuals and decreased in old individuals.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Obesity has long been recognized as one of the major health problems in many countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is believed to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality, which are resulted from various chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The epidemic of obesity has been attributed to economic growth, rapid urbanization, and subsequent lifestyle changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The contribution of heredity factor may also partially account for obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Over the past two decades, China has encountered a great economic development. As a result, the prevalence of overweight or obesity has significantly increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. From 1992 to 1998, Shanghai (the largest city in China) had a rapid increase in overweight rates (men: 77%; women: 39%) and in obesity rates (men: 62% and women: 129%) according to the WHO BMI standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The aims of the present paper are to: (1) evaluate the prevalences of overweight and obesity; (2) assess the contributing factors associated with overweight and obesity; (3) detect the changes of BMI after 3.6 years in Shanghai metropolitan populations.</p><p>To our knowledge, systematic assessment of the prevalences, the risk factors and the trends for overweight and obesity using a population-based longitudinal study of Shanghai has seldom been reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Survey and study population</title><p>The present analysis was based on the data set of a community-based prospective study, i.e. Shanghai Diabetes Study (SHDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The aims of the study were to assess the changes in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and the association between the metabolic syndrome and sequent cardiovascular events over a follow-up period in two Shanghai communities.</p><p>The population of the study has been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Shanghai had a population of about 16.4 million in 2000 with more than one hundred communities. Huayang and Caoyang were two medium-income urban communities in Shanghai and were selected for this study.</p><p>The cohort subjects were enrolled from the two urban communities with multistage sampling schemes (cluster, sex- and age-stratified, random). Pregnant women and those who were suffered from cancer, severe disability or severe psychiatric disturbance were excluded. At baseline, 2978 subjects were enrolled from September to November in 1998, April to September in 1999, and April to August in 2000 in Huayang community; and 3016 subjects were enrolled from July to November in 2001 in Caoyang community. The response rates were 97% in Huayang and 93% in Caoyang. A total of 5994 subjects aged from 15 to 95 years old were recruited and examined at baseline. Among these participants, 5364 subjects were aged from 25 to 95 years and were analyzed for this study.</p><p>Subsequently, a follow-up survey was conducted between December 2003 and February 2004 in Huayang community; between June 2004 and November 2004 in Caoyang community. Quite a few subjects were lost to follow-up later during an average 3.6-year follow-up. Finally a total of 3168 participants (aged &#x02265; 15 years at baseline) were interviewed and reexamined, among which 3032 subjects were aged 25&#x02013;95 years (at baseline).</p><p>Informed consent was obtained from each participant. The protocol was in accordance with Helsinki Declaration, and was approved by the local ethical committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><p>The 6<sup>th </sup>hospital served as a coordinating and data center of the study. The two community hospitals formed the operating and monitoring units. The investigation stuff, from the three hospitals, consisted of diabetic specialists, physicians, epidemiologists and nurses.</p><sec><title>Measurements at baseline</title><p>Participants arrived at the community hospitals at 6 to 7 AM following an overnight fast. After venous blood samples were collected, each participant received a 75-g OGTT, except for those with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM). Plasma glucose, serum insulin and serum lipid profiles were determined. In addition, some anthropometric indices were measured, including height, weight, waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference. Note that the height and weight were measured to the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1 kg, respectively, while the participants were barefoot and in light clothing using Height &#x00026; Weight Scale. Then baseline BMI was calculated as baseline weight divided by baseline height squared (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). And waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was waist circumference divided by hip circumference. Body fat percent (BF %) was measured using the Body Fat Analyzer (TBF-401, TANITA, US). Using the standard right arm-cuff method, the patient's blood pressure was measured three times (with a one-minute rest interval) with a mercury sphygmomanometer after at least five-minutes rest, then the means of three measurements were adopted. The methods used in this paper can be found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements at follow-up survey after an average of 3.6 years</title><p>At follow-up survey, such items as metabolic syndrome components, including weight and height, were examined in the same way as that of baseline. Unfortunately, some heights of the subjects were not measured at the follow-up survey. So the 3.6-year BMI was calculated using baseline height and weight after 3.6 years, which we believed is short enough for the height changes to be neglectable.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Questionnaire</title><p>Trained stuff administered a standardized questionnaire to each individual through face-to-face interviews with him or her during check-up interval at baseline and follow-up survey. The questionnaires were about the demographic and lifestyle data of each subjects, including education, socio-economic factors, smoking habits, alcohol intake, medical history, and family history of disease.</p><sec><title>(1) Assessment of household income and educational level at baseline</title><p>Monthly household income was classified into 4 levels: 1) &#x0003c;1,000 yuan RMB; 2) 1,100&#x02013;2,000 yuan RMB; 3) 2,100&#x02013;3,000 yuan RMB and 4) &#x0003e;3,000 yuan RMB.</p><p>The educational levels were categorized into three groups: 1) low education (illiteracy, primary and secondary education, less than 8&#x02013;9 years schooling), 2) medium education (high school education, 9&#x02013;12 years schooling) and 3) high education (college or university education, more than 14 years schooling).</p></sec><sec><title>(2) Assessment of smoking and alcohol intake behavior at baseline</title><p>We designed two questions for current cigarette smoking (the mean daily cigarette consumption in the past year and duration of smoking) and three questions related to quitting behaviors (duration of smoking cessation, the mean daily cigarette consumption and duration of smoking before smoking cessation). Then three groups of individuals (nonsmoker, current smoker and ex-smoker) were identified. Nonsmokers were defined as those who had never smoked, or smoked only occasionally; current smokers were those who smoked at least one cigarette per day lasting for at least one year; ex-smokers were those who had regularly smoked in the past, but had quit for at least half year.</p><p>As for the alcohol intake behavior, the individuals were questioned about their types, frequencies and quantity of alcohol intake in the past one year. The subjects were divided into three groups (nondrinker, current drinkers and ex-drinker) according to the frequency and quantity for the three types of alcohol beverages, which included Chinese distilled spirit, beer and rice wine (a type of Chinese alcoholic beverage brewed directly from grains such as rice, millet or wheat. Such liquors contain less than 20% alcohol). Nondrinkers were those who never or only occasionally drank; current drinkers were those who drank 6 g or more alcohol per day on average for at least one year; and ex-drinkers were those who had been a drinker, but quit for at least half a year before the baseline survey.</p><p>For current drinker, the consumption of the three alcohol beverages was recorded. The mean daily consumption of alcohol beverage was estimated and was expressed as grams of Chinese distilled spirit, rice wine or bottles of beer per day in the past year, and alcohol consumed per day was equal to the sum of alcohol consumed per day from Chinese distilled spirit, rice wine and beer. Crude estimations were adopted, i.e. 10 grams of alcohol consumed were roughly equal to 25 gram Chinese distilled spirit, 80 gram rice wine or 250 ml (half bottle) beer.</p></sec><sec><title>(3) Assessment of the family history of obesity at baseline</title><p>The questionnaires included the family history of obesity, which were about their biological mother, father, brothers, or sisters (first-degree relatives). Then the individuals were classified into two categories: 1) those who reported that no first-degree relatives had been obese; 2) those who reported that at least one first-degree relative had been obese.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Diagnosis criteria</title><p>The WHO or the Chinese BMI cut-off points were used to define overweight and obesity.</p><p>(a) WHO standard (WHO, 2000)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]:</p><p>Underweight: BMI &#x0003c; 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</p><p>Normal weight: 18.5 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>&#x02264; BMI &#x0003c; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</p><p>Overweight: 25 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>&#x02264; BMI &#x0003c; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</p><p>Obesity: BMI &#x02265; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</p><p>(b) Chinese standard (2002) proposed by the Working Group on Obesity in China (WGOC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]</p><p>Underweight: BMI &#x0003c; 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</p><p>Normal weight: 18.5 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>&#x02264; BMI &#x0003c; 24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</p><p>Overweight: 24 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>&#x02264; BMI &#x0003c; 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</p><p>Obesity: BMI &#x02265; 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</p><p>Hypertension: SBP &#x02265; 140 mmHg or DBP &#x02265; 90 mmHg or hypertension having been diagnosed and being received anti-hypertension therapy;</p><p>Diabetic Mellitus: FPG &#x02265; 7.0 mmol/L or 2 hPG &#x02265; 11.1 mmol/L or diabetic mellitus having been diagnosed and being received therapy;</p><p>The following cut-off values, proposed by the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], were applied: high TC (&#x02265;5.18 mmol/L), high LDL-C (&#x02265;3.37 mmol/L), high TG (&#x02265;1.70 mmol/L), low HDL-C (&#x0003c;1.04 mmol/L for males and &#x0003c;1.30 mmol/L for females).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS 15.0 for Windows.

Considering that gender differences in the prevalences and the risk factors of overweight and obesity had been found in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], all analyses were done separately for men and women in this paper.</p><sec><title>1. The standardized prevalences</title><p>According to the WHO BMI cut-offs, the national adults prevalences of overweight and obesity were 12.9% and 1.5% in 1992 (the average prevalences were over 44485 subjects aged 20&#x02013;60 years old) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; 18.28% and 2.48% in 1995.7&#x02013;1997.6 (the prevalences were standardized by the structure of Chinese census 1990 over 42751 subjects aged 20&#x02013;74 years old) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; as well as 18.9% and 2.9% in 2002 (the prevalences were standardized by the structure of Chinese census 2000 over 140022 subjects aged &#x02265; 18 years old) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], respectively. In general, the prevalences of overweight and obesity are higher in northern areas than in southern areas, in big cities than in medium or small cities, in medium or small cities than in rural areas, and in developed areas than in developing areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In 2002, according to the Chinese BMI criteria and the structure of Chinese census 2000, the standardized prevalences of overweight for men and women were 31.1% and 25.8% in urban, and 19.6% and 21.4% in rural, respectively. In addition, 10.3% of the men and 9.5% of the women was obesity in urban, 4.9% of the men and 6.8% of the women was obesity in rural [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In our study, according to the Chinese BMI criteria, the standardized prevalences of overweight were 34.9% in men and 29.9% in women; the standardized prevalences of obesity were 8.3% in men and 10.0% in women. Our research showed an epidemic of overweight and obesity in Shanghai, the largest metropolitan city of China.</p></sec><sec><title>2. The risk factors of overweight and obesity for men and women</title><sec><title>(1) Shared risk factors for both genders: age and family history of obesity</title><sec><title>Age</title><p>Age has been considered as a prognostic factor of obesity for both genders in a series of published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this paper, the risk of overweight and obesity changed among the different age groups for men and women. So the age group variable (10-year age stratifications) was introduced as a covariate in the final models to erase the age confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Family history of obesity</title><p>Family history of obesity is shown to be a main predictor for obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It represents not only genetic susceptibility, shared environment, and common lifestyles, but also the interactions among them. Investigators had been advised to consider genetic factor in each study of human obesity. Our results in accordance with the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], indicated about 1.2-fold increase in the risk of overweight and obesity for both genders with family history of obesity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>(2) Nonshared risk factors for both genders: smoking behaviors (in men), alcohol intake (in men) and education (in women)</title><sec><title>Smoking behaviors</title><p>Lower risk of overweight and obesity was shown among current smokers than nonsmokers (OR = 0.76, <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) in men in this research. The negative association had also been found in some other cross-sectional studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A cohort study has also reported that longitudinal BMI increased less in smokers than in nonsmokers among middle-age subjects and decreased more in smokers than in nonsmokers among old-age subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Although weight gain after quitting smoking was commonly cited in men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the correlation between smoking cessation and risk of overweight and obesity was not detected in our study.</p></sec><sec><title>Alcohol intake</title><p>The relation between alcohol intake and body weight was found to be either positive in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]or nonexistent in other previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This relation was affected by frequency, quantity and type of alcohol, and also affected by additional calories intake accompanied with alcohol intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In our study, most alcohol drinkers were light to moderate drinkers (see the characteristics of alcohol intake habits described in the result); and current male drinkers had a higher risk of overweight and obesity than nondrinkers (OR = 1.42, p = 0.002). Because few subjects were ex-drinkers, statistical difference was not detected between ex-drinkers and nondrinkers.</p><p>In China, smoking and alcohol drinking are much less common in women than in men. In our study, sex difference was significant for smoking and alcohol intake behaviors. Male smokers accounted for 91.3% of 1131 current smokers. And 91.9% of 631 current drinkers were male, which may partly explain the gender difference in the risk profiles.</p></sec><sec><title>Education</title><p>The inverse association had been found between education and obesity in both genders in previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and had been found only in women in some other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our result appears to be supportive of the latter. Compared with low-educated women, medium- and high- educated women were at a lower risk of overweight and obesity.</p></sec><sec><title>Household income</title><p>Over the last few decades in the industrialized nations, a transition from a positive to a negative association had been seen between household income and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In this study, the negative association was found in women in univariate model but not found in multivariate model. One possible reason was that education and income were correlated with each other and education was more strongly associated with the risk of overweight and obesity than income in this population.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>3. Obesity associated with metabolic diseases/disorders</title><p>Obese people commonly experience hypertension, lipidemia, and impaired glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. With increasing BMI, the proportion of diabetes, hypertension and dislipidemia gradually elevated. The dose-response relationships supported the possibility that a cause-and-effect relationship existed between increasing BMI and metabolic diseases/disorders, and that the underweight individuals had better health in metabolic status than those with normal weight in southern Chinese.</p></sec><sec><title>4. Changes of BMI after an average of 3.6 years</title><p>The means of BMI changed slightly over 3.6 years (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Being consistent with the results of Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> suggested that the individuals were most likely (85%&#x02013;93%) to remain in their original BMI groups among different age groups after 3.6 years. Meanwhile, for young and middle-aged individuals, there was a higher proportion switching from the underweight and normal weight group into the overweight and obesity group than that of reverse switching. But this case was not true for the old individuals. Some similar trends in BMI had been demonstrated in previous researches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Therefore, for combating the current epidemic of obesity, more attention should be paid to the young and middle-aged individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>5. Limitation</title><p>The limitation of our study was that many subjects were lost during the follow-up period, and only 3168 of the baseline subjects were recalled at the second follow-up survey. The main reason for lose-up was that many subjects transferred to other communities as a result of the city reconstruction, which accounted for about 60% of all the lost subjects. Other reasons included noncooperation, being away from home, illness and death.</p><p>There were some statistical differences between the subjects followed up vs. those lost to follow up at the second visit. The differences included sex, age, education, income (in male), and drinking (in male). So we only detected changes of BMI for each individual using self before-after control analysis after an average 3.6 years in our paper.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in Shanghai metropolis adults. The risk factors of overweight and obesity are multifactorial and gender specific. After an average of 3.6 years, most individuals remain in their original BMI groups. Meanwhile, the slight increase of BMI is found mainly in the middle-aged individuals.</p><p>These results support the notion that some risk factors can be used to identify individuals with high risk of overweight and obesity. These risk factors include family history of obesity, some behavior habits (alcohol intake) and education. Therefore, a community-based multiple strategies are urgently required to combat increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in Shanghai communities.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HL, YZ and HG participated in the data collection; WJ, YB, KX participated in the design of this study and general supervision of this research group; XH performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
