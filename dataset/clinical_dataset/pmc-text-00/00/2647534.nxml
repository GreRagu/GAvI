NBTs derive from neural crest stem cells (NCSC) blocked at different stages of the sympathetic nervous system development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Histologically, NBT are composed of variable proportion of neuroblasts (neuronal lineage) and Schwannian-like cells (glial lineage). Prior studies have reported that both cell types share chromosomal abnormalities, suggesting a common neoplastic precursor cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] however; discrepant studies failed to detect genetic alterations in the Schwannian components of NBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The differentiation process of NCSC gives rise to peripheral nervous system (PNS), amongst other structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This process can be tracked by analyzing marker proteins sequentially expressed during embryonic cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Likewise, the embryonic origin of neuroblastic tumor cells can be established using NCSC protein markers such as Phox2b and c-kit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] while embryonic glial-lineage markers such as SRY box 10 transcription factor (Sox10) and AP2&#x003b1; are expressed in immature glial cells in NBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>NBT cell components may be identified using a variety of protein markers. The glial component may be identified by the expression of the calcium binding family protein S100. Specifically, S100A6 (Calcyclin), has been reported as a neural crest derived glial-cell lineage marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], also expressed in the fetal CNS glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Calcyclin migrates to the nuclear membrane upon an increase of intracellular calcium concentration; its precise function remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In NBT, calcyclin expression is mostly found in Schwann-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The neuronal lineage compartment of NBT is characterized by the expression of proteins like neurofilament proteins and the membrane ganglioside GD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. GD2 is expressed in fetal brain neuroblasts and neuroectodermal derived tumors. Cell membrane GD2, synthesized by the GD2 synthase, is implicated in cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Biedler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] described three cell subtypes spontaneously arising in NB cell line cultures, the N (neuroblastic), S (substrate adherent) and I (intermediate) subtypes. These three cell line subtypes were isolated and characterized on the basis of the different cell culture behavior and protein expression pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. I-type cell lines, reported to have a bipotential capacity to differentiate towards both neuronal and glial lineage when induced with retinoic acid and bromodeoxyuridine respectively, have recently been proposed as NBT stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Retinoic acid is a vitamin A derived molecule, which plays an important role in the early development of the nervous system stimulating neuronal differentiation and inducing the expression of neuronal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Bromodeoxyuridine is a thymidine analog which incorporates into the newly synthesized DNA during the S phase of cell cycle. It has been used as a glial differentiation factor <italic>in vitro </italic>for NB, inducing cell flattening and increased substrate adhesiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we aimed to characterize each NB cell line subtype according to differential lineage markers from the embryonic development of PNS and test whether the intermediate subtype of NB derived cell lines reproduce a distinct and bipotential (neuronal and glial) stage of differentiation. A continuum process of differentiation between neuronal and glial lineage, which resemble the normal PNS development, was identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cell lines characterization</title><p>Eleven cell lines were investigated.

S-type cell lines were morphologically characterized by large flat cytoplasms, relaxed chromatin and strong adherence to the flask surface. N- and I-type cell lines showed a very similar phenotype in culture, characterized by a low cytoplasm/nuclei ratio, poor adherence to the flask surface, growth in dense cell aggregates and neurite processes formation. Only one cell line displayed a clear intermediate phenotype, the I-type cell line SK-N-ER, characterized by a larger cytoplasm and greater adherence to the flask surface than the other I-type cell lines, features resembling those of the S-type cell lines.</p><p>Amongst the NBT cell line subtypes the intermediate neurofilaments and vimentin have been proposed as differentially expressed markers for neuronal and glial phenotypes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, both proteins are expressed in the cytoplasm of the three cell subtypes. The neurofilament NF68 showed a higher cytoplasmic expression in the N- and I cell subtypes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). On the other hand, vimentin was detected with similar intensity, in the cytoplasm of all the cell lines analyzed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In our hands, these markers were not helpful to distinguish amongst the cell lines subtypes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Neuroblastic and glial immunophenotype in NB cell line subtypes</bold>.

Similar intense cytoplasm membrane GD2 immunostaining was observed in both N- and I-type cells, while intense nuclear membrane calcyclin was identified exclusively in the S-type. N- and I-type showed a faint diffuse cytoplasm staining for calcyclin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Thus, among the markers tested, we found cytoplasm membrane-GD2 and nuclear-calcyclin immunolabelling as reliable NBT neuroblastic and glial lineage markers, respectively.</p><p>Of note, all but one of the S-type cell lines studied, the exception being LA1-5S, turned out not to be pure cultures since few morphologically N-type cells, which were GD2-membrane positive, were identified.

N- and I-type cell lines shared a similar immunoreactivity pattern, namely high membrane GD2 staining, absence of nuclear calcyclin and high neurofilament NF68 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>Protein markers of undifferentiated neural crest derived cells, such as GAP43, c-kit and Phox2b, as well as the undifferentiated cell marker ABCG2, were positive in all the cell line subtypes tested (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Intense GAP43 immunostaining was detected in the cytoplasm of N-type cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and two of the four I-type cell lines. S-type and the rest of I-type cell lines showed a lower intensity of GAP43 cytoplasmic staining (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Similar results were observed for c-kit immunostaining (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). On the other hand, nuclear localization of Phox2b positivity was identified in the I-type cell lines, in some cells being very intense. A lower nuclear intensity was identified for the N- and S-type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Morphological and immunophenotypical changes</title><p>When differentiation was induced towards neuronal lineage by treatment with ATRA, both N- and I-type cell lines changed their morphology. One week after treatment most cells showed a neuronal-like phenotype, displaying long and growing neurites. These cells proliferated forming large, dense interconnected cell clumps that were eventually released as floating spherical cell aggregates, neurospheres, with capacity to grow in suspension (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In the N-type, changes appeared early in the first week of treatment and persisted during all the differentiation induction experiment (60 days). All the I-type cells showed morphological changes, the most remarkable being in the SK-N-Be2C cell line. During the first week of treatment neurites grew significantly, and, after two weeks, floating neurospheres appeared. The I-type SK-N-LP cell line did not form neurospheres, but poorly adherent cell clusters. In the I-type SK-N-ER cell line, the morphological changes appeared later and around the 5<sup>th </sup>week of treatment they formed neurospheres. In all the N- and I-type cell lines, the morphological changes remained evident even when ATRA treatment was removed; however, the capacity to form neurospheres was clearly diminished. Overall, no significant change in the proliferation ratio was detected in the cell lines during treatment, however, an increase in cell mortality was observed after one week of treatment.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Morphological, immunophenotypical and gene expression changes induced by ATRA</bold>.

For S-type cells, no GD2 staining was observed during the entire neuronal induced differentiation experiment. No changes of ABCG2 and NF68 neurofilament immunostaining was detected in the cell lines.</p><p>In all the N- and I-type cell lines, some nuclear calcyclin positive cells were detected during ATRA induced neuronal differentiation. S-like cells were initially detected in the periphery of the adhered neuronal clusters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Throughout the induction of neuronal differentiation, these nuclear-calcyclin positive cells increased in number and acquired S-type morphology, enabling us to isolate them attached to the flask taking advantage of their greater capacity of adherence. However, when isolated from the neuronal cells, these potentially S-type cells stopped growing and died after 2&#x02013;3 weeks. New aliquots of the cell lines tested were thawed and treated separately to verify whether the presence of nuclear-calcyclin positive cells was not due to cross contamination. Furthermore, non-treated control cell lines were studied in parallel and did not show any of the abovementioned changes observed during the ATRA treatment. Repeated experiments demonstrated that newly induced S-like cells arise in response to ATRA treatment.</p><p>The S-type cell line LA1-5S showed no apparent changes when treated with ATRA. It did not show changes in morphology, continued to be adherent to the flask and preserved a flat and large cytoplasm. However, calcyclin nuclear membrane staining decreased during treatment and was re-established upon ATRA removal.</p></sec><sec><title>I.b. Calcyclin, GD2 synthase and SOX10 gene expression changes</title><p>To further investigate changes induced during ATRA differentiation assays, mRNA levels of relevant genes like calcyclin, GD2 synthase and SOX10 were analyzed by qRT-PCR at different time points in the three cell subtypes (LA1-55N, SK-N-Be2C, SK-N-ER and LA1-5S).</p><p>ATRA treatment induced an increase of calcyclin transcript levels in the N-type LA1-55N cell line. The I-type cell line, SK-N-ER, displayed a peak of expression (more than 2-fold) at day 3 of treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). The S-type cell line, LA1-5S, showed a slow decrease of the calcyclin expression level after 3 days of treatment, with a recover of expression detected at day 7 when ATRA was removed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). In the I-type SK-N-Be2C cell line, calcyclin mRNA expression was undetectable by q-PCR until day 60, when an increase of expression was detected that decreased again to undetectable levels after ATRA depletion (data not shown).</p><p>GD2 synthase expression increased during ATRA treatment in N- and I-type cell lines, with a significant increase in the LA1-55N cells. However, LA1-5S showed a minor increase, with a 1.49&#x02013;0.85 fold variation of expression levels with respect to non-treated controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>).</p><p>SOX10 expression was studied in order to clarify the new appearance of S-like cells during neuronal-lineage induced differentiation experiments. SOX10 mRNA was undetectable by q-PCR in all the cell lines tested, both in the treated as well as in the non-treated controls cell lines (data not shown).</p><p>Taken together, these results show that I-type and N-type cells display a similar behavior when neuronal differentiation is induced, both showing the capacity to differentiate along the neuronal lineage. On the other hand, for S-type cells, no neuronal-like phenotype was observed, despite the gene expression changes detected. The S-like cells arising during neuronal lineage induced differentiation suggest the bipotential capacity of some of the neuroblastic cells in both N- and I-type cultures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>II.

Morphological and immunophenotypical changes</title><p>After one week of BrdU treatment, morphological changes became apparent. N- and I-type cell lines acquired an S-like morphology, large flat cytoplasm, and augmented adherence to the flask surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The S-type cell line did not show any apparent changes. Immunophenotypically, the N- and I-type cell lines showed a decrease of GD2 staining at day 7 of BrdU treatment in comparison to the non-treated control culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Calcyclin staining in the nuclear membrane appeared in some cells one week after induction, corresponding with the occurrence of the above mentioned changes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Likewise, in all the cell lines subtypes, N, S and I, cytoplasmic Sox10 staining increased during treatment and at 3 weeks some nuclear positive cells appeared (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Specifically, S100 staining showed a slight increase during BrdU differentiation, increasing the cytoplasmic staining and showing nuclear staining in some cells after 21 days of treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). These changes were not detected in the non treated control cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Morphological and immunophenotypical changes induced by BrdU glial differentiation treatment</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

It has been clearly established that early neural-crest cells are multipotent at the cellular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and perhaps in reflection of the innate multipotency, neural-crest derived cells display long lasting plasticity during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This plasticity is also reflected in the phenomenon of transdifferentiation, whereby cells change from one unique phenotype into another without going through a developmentally less mature stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Neural-crest derived tumors like NBT as well as NBT cell lines show many of the cell phenotypes characteristic of the developing neural crest cells: cellular heterogeneity, plasticity and transdifferentiation capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Normal embryogenesis of the PNS involves a bilineal stage of cell differentiation whereby early glial and neuronal markers can be found coexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In neuroblastoma, I-type cells have been described to exhibit an intermediate morphological and <italic>in vitro </italic>behavior, sharing characteristics of both N- and S-type cells, and express neuronal as well as glial lineage markers, and to reproduce a distinct and bipotential (neuronal and glial) stage of differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Instead of neurofilaments and calcyclin, we found cytoplasm membrane-GD2 and nuclear-calcyclin as reliable NBT neuroblastic and glial lineage markers, respectively. By immunofluorescence, N- and I-type showed similar pattern of expression with high GD2 and undetectable calcyclin. On the other hand, S-type exhibited a high nuclear-membrane calcylin staining and no ganglioside GD2 expression. I-type cells represent thus, a distinct NB cell subpopulation, an intermediate state between the neuronal and glial lineages, however closer to neuroblastic lineage.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to characterize each NBT cell line subtype according to differential lineage markers from the embryonic development of PNS. Initially, lineage markers such as vimentin and GAP43 (glial and neuronal, respectively) were studied. In our hands, these proteins did not display differential expression between the different cell subtypes. An undifferentiated state of the cell lines was studied by using neural crest cells markers such as c-kit and Phox2b. These proteins displayed positive immunostaining in all the cell lines subtypes, suggesting a derivative from an immature state, comparable to neural crest cells.</p><p>NB cell lines can be induced to differentiate along many neural crest cell lineages like chromaffin cells, Schwann cells, melanocytes and neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Differentiation inducers towards neuronal lineage like ATRA or glial lineage like BrdU have been thoroughly described in NBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We showed that, upon ATRA treatment, both N- and I-type cell lines can be induced to differentiate towards a neuronal-like lineage, while, no neuronal-like phenotype was observed in the S-type cell line, despite the gene expression changes detected.</p><p>Furthermore, with BrdU treatment, our results for N- and I-type cell lines showed a similar shift towards a glial-like phenotype (S-type shape, reduced GD2 and increase of glial-lineage markers) for both cell subtypes. Recently, Narath et al. (2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] described cellular senescence in MYCN amplified F-type NBT cells after 6 weeks of hydroxyurea treatment. F-type cells share some morphological features with the S-type cells. In our experiments, the abnormal aspect of BrdU treated cells and proliferation arrest after few weeks of treatment suggested that long exposition to BrdU might induce senescence. Our results, however, demonstrate that BrdU induced <italic>bona fide </italic>glial differentiation for the first two weeks of treatment. After longer exposure (3 weeks) to BrdU, senescence was induced.</p><p>In order to further correlate the embryonic development of the PNS and the <italic>in vitro </italic>model, we studied Sox10 induction. Sox10, which is expressed in NCSC and a subset of neural-crest derived lineages, plays a key role in maintaining pluripotency and inhibiting premature differentiation at the stem cell stage. <italic>In vivo</italic>, glial-lineage differentiation is a default program during the NCSC differentiation pathway towards a neuronal fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Downregulation of SOX10 is a prerequisite for neuronal lineage differentiation and its expression is maintained in the terminally differentiated glial cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our results show that SOX10 is undetectable in all cell lines and ATRA treatment does not activate SOX10 expression. However, SOX10 expression is induced when glial differentiation is promoted by BrdU treatment with a fast increase of SOX10 expression in the S-type cell line and slower but significant increase in the N- and I-type cell lines.</p><p>Our results suggest that N- and I-type NB cells represent an immature bilineage stage, able to progress towards neuronal as well as glial fates upon induction of differentiation.</p><p>In addition to neurite elongation, neuron specific protein and gene expression induction, when N- and I-type cell lines were induced to differentiate with ATRA, two phenomena appeared concomitantly: clumps floating spheres similar to the previously described neurospheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and newly formed S-type cells. Neurospheres formation has been previously reported to occur spontaneously in N-type cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The spontaneous or induced formation of neurospheres or big floating cell clusters has been described related to neural stemness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Ongoing experiments in our laboratory are investigating whether the differentiating neurospheres contain multipotent stem-like cells.</p><p>Concurrently to neuroblastic cells clustering, S-like cells appeared in the periphery of these cell clusters. Motohashi et al., (2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] have recently reported the presence of glial cells in ATRA treated NCSC cultures. Neuron-glia interactions control several processes in brain development, such as neurogenesis, myelination, synapse formations and neuronal migration, proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. During PNS development neuronal and glial differentiation are interdependent and the fates of these two types of cells are inextricably entangled. Moreover, in neuroblastoma, it has been hypothesized that Schwann cells release factors that could induce neuronal differentiation, providing better prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Our results, first the appearance of S-like cells during induction of differentiation with ATRA in N- and I-type cells, and second the incapacity of these cells to survive devoid of N-/I-type cells, suggest a necessary cross-talk between immature neuron-glia in neuroblastoma tumor cells upon induced differentiation.</p><p>Overall, our findings highlight how N- and I-type cells possess a similar differentiation potential, and represent an uncommitted stage between neuronal and glial fates, whereas S-type cells seem to be committed towards a glial lineage fate. These comparable characteristics display, however, a degree of variability within and amongst the N- and I-cell line subtypes suggesting a continuum process in the differentiation program reproduced by the cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the characterization of each NB cell line subtype showed how all three cell lines represent an immature stage of the neural crest. However, both N- and I-type phenotypes are consistent with immature multilineage potential cells, since, upon induction, are able to progress towards neuronal as well as glial fates. By immunophenotype I-type cells did not show an intermediate pattern suggesting a distinct bipotential stage (neuronal and glial), although differential gene expression analysis revealed clear differences between the 3 subtypes. S-type cell lines, on the other hand, appear irreversibly committed towards glial lineage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue culture and cell lines</title><p>Phenotype characterization studies were performed on four N-type human neuroblastoma cell lines (LAN-1, LA1-55N, Be2-M17V and SH-SY5Y), four I-type cell lines (SK-N-Be2C, SK-N-JD, SK-N-LP and SK-N-ER) and three S-type (LA1-5S, SH-EP1 and SK-N-AS).
