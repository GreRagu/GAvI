In eukaryotes, three classes of such RNAs have been characterized most extensively. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) mediate RNA interference or silencing, in which target mRNAs are degraded. microRNAs (miRNAs) are identical in structure to siRNAs, but have different origins and processing. miRNAs regulate protein accumulation from target mRNAs by a variety of mechanisms. Repeat associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs) are synthesized through yet another pathway, and function in both chromatin organization and mRNA degradation. Each class of small RNA acts in conjunction with a protein complex consisting of an Argonaute family member and associated proteins: the RNA provides specificity through base pairing, either complete or incomplete, with targets, and the proteins act as effectors by various mechanisms that in most cases are not yet fully understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Bartel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Oogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a developmental context rich in post-transcriptional control of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Lipshitz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Not surprisingly, small RNAs are active in this setting. The most extensive evidence is available for the rasiRNA pathway, for which the Argonaute proteins are Piwi, Aubergine (Aub) and AGO3. The Piwi and Aub proteins have well established roles during oogenesis in controlling stem cell divisions and in the events leading to formation of the embryonic germ line cells, but the details of their modes of action were not well understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Cox1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Wilson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, Piwi, Aub and AGO3 have been found to associate with rasiRNAs, and <italic>piwi</italic> and <italic>aub</italic> mutants (no <italic>AGO3</italic> mutants have been described) are defective in the rasiRNA dependent silencing of various retrotransposons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Saito1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Chen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. A number of genes have been implicated in the production of rasiRNAs; mutation of any of these genes results in deregulation of the transposons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Vagin1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Pane1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Lim1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>siRNAs were the first small regulatory RNAs shown to be active during oogenesis, but with limitations on when they can function. Late stage oocytes do not support RNA interference. However, this pathway is activated during egg activation, and introduction of exogenous dsRNAs results in degradation of target mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Kennerdell1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Early in oogenesis the RNA interference pathway alters expression of <italic>oskar</italic> (<italic>osk</italic>) mRNA, apparently via indirect effects on the cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Cook1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. It is not known why this pathway is not active throughout all of oogenesis. AGO2, the Argonaute protein that acts in RISC, the RNP complex that mediates RNA interference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Okamura1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, is present for all the stages of oogenesis when immunodetection is possible (i.e., prior to deposition of the vitelline membrane), but whether it is present in the late stage oocytes that do not support RNA interference is unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Brennecke1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Findley1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Indirect evidence suggests that there will be miRNA-dependent control of translation in the ovary. Multiple miRNAs are present at high levels in early stage embryos, when zygotic transcription has not yet begun, and so these should have been provided maternally as a consequence of synthesis in the ovary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Aravin1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, several miRNAs have been directly shown to be present in the ovary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Saito1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. A second line of indirect evidence comes from characterization of <italic>AGO1</italic> mutants. AGO1 is the Argonaute protein that acts in the miRNP, the RNP complex that mediates miRNA-dependent translational control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Okamura1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutation and overexpression of <italic>AGO1</italic> each affect, with opposite consequences, the fate of germline stem cells, leading to the proposal that the miRNA pathway acts in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Yang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the roles of different AGO proteins can overlap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Meyer1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The roles of AGO1 and AGO2 were defined in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Okamura1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, and evidence that a particular protein has one role in one tissue does not necessarily mean that it will do the same in all other settings. The possibility of miRNA control in the germ line cells of the ovary was also raised by a peculiar feature of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA regulation. Specifically, in certain mutants with drastically reduced levels of Osk protein, a large fraction of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA is present in polysomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Braat1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Such a phenomenon &#x02013; polysome association of mRNAs not directing the accumulation of the encoded protein &#x02013; is a feature of some mRNAs under miRNA control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Bartel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, although other regulatory pathways have the same effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Rajavel1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>If miRNA-dependent translational control does operate in the ovary, then the site or sites at which the regulation occurs will be of interest, and may provide information about possible mechanisms. At present, the mechanism of miRNA-dependent translational repression is a subject of controversy. Some studies have pointed to miRNAs intervening after the initiation of translation, which, as noted above, results in association with polysomes without protein accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Maroney1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Petersen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Other analyses have revealed an effect of miRNAs on initiation of translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Pillai1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Chendrimada1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The latter option fits well with observed sites of miRNA regulation, in P bodies. P bodies were initially identified, in yeast, as RNPs containing mRNAs destined for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Brengues1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Teixeira1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, mammalian P bodies have been found to contain mRNAs under miRNA control, as well as AGO proteins and other proteins required for the action of miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Pillai1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Chu1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Sen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells P body formation has been shown to be a consequence of RNA-mediated gene silencing, whether by <italic>AGO1</italic>- or <italic>AGO2</italic>-dependent pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Eulalio1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. P bodies lack ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Teixeira1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, and so an mRNA under miRNA repression could not be in P bodies if it is associated with polysomes. In the germline cells of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary there appear to be no conventional P bodies, but instead a higher order structure known as sponge bodies. Sponge bodies were first described as cytoplasmic sites at which the Exuperantia (Exu) protein, which acts in mRNA localization, is highly concentrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-WilschBrauninger1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequently, a number of other proteins with roles in post-transcriptional control of gene expression have been shown to colocalize with Exu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Wilhelm1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Delanoue1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, the sponge body proteins include homologs of multiple P body components, and sponge bodies are largely devoid of ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-WilschBrauninger1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Sponge bodies and P bodies do not appear to be equivalent, as sponge bodies include cisternae and vesicles while no membrane is found in the P body-like GW182 bodies (there have been no ultrastructural studies of P bodies)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-WilschBrauninger1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Yang2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it does seem likely that sponge bodies represent a membrane-based framework upon which RNPs similar or equivalent to P bodies are positioned. By analogy to mammalian cells and to cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, these sponge body RNPs would be an expected site of miRNA action.</p><p>Here we directly test for miRNA-dependent translational repression in the ovary, and find that it does occur. We also show that there is no detectable concentration of repressed mRNAs with sponge bodies. Instead, the regulated mRNAs are present in numerous very small cytoplasmic particles. Both AGO1 and AGO2 (or GFP fusions to these proteins) appear in similar small particles. These results do not rule out any specific model for the mechanism by which miRNAs repress translation in the ovary, but do allow for translational inhibitory mechanisms that act after initiation of translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To test for miRNA activity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary we focused on <italic>miR-312</italic>. Northern blot analysis of miRNAs during embryogenesis has revealed that <italic>miR-312</italic> is present at the highest levels in 0&#x02013;1 hour embryos, suggesting that it is expressed during oogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Aravin1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Six tandem copies of a synthetic <italic>miR-312</italic> binding site were added to the 3&#x02032; UTR of a <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The binding sites were designed to allow incomplete base pairing with <italic>miR-312</italic>, such that the 5&#x02032; &#x02018;seed&#x02019; and 3&#x02032; regions of the miRNA would be fully base paired, with a central unpaired bulge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Interrupted base pairing of this type usually leads to translational repression by miRNAs, rather than RNA degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Doench1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Saxena1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Multiple copies of the <italic>miR-312</italic> binding sites were used to increase the probability of efficient <italic>miR-312</italic> binding. Although no confirmed targets of <italic>miR-312</italic> action have been identified, the ovarian <italic>kelch</italic> mRNA is a candidate with 4 predicted <italic>miR-312</italic> binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Burgler1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Transcription of the reporter transgene relies on the UAS component, which responds to the GAL4 transcriptional activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Brand1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Rorth1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Following expression of the reporter (<italic>UAS-GFP-312</italic>) and control (<italic>UAS-GFP</italic>) transgenes in the germline cells of the ovary using the <italic>matalpha4-GAL-VP16</italic> driver, GFP protein and mRNA levels were measured by quantitative western blot analysis and quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR). The transgene with <italic>miR-312</italic> sites produces significantly less GFP than the control transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). This difference can be attributed in part, but not in whole, to unequal mRNA levels: the mRNA with <italic>miR-312</italic> targets is present at 70&#x00025; of the level of the control transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Normalization for the different mRNA levels reveals that the <italic>GFP -312</italic> mRNA is about half as active as the control <italic>GFP</italic> mRNA in production of GFP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Thus, the presence of the <italic>miR-312</italic> target sites in the <italic>GFP-312</italic> mRNA confers translational repression.</p><p>As an additional assay of miRNA activity, a second set of transgenes was constructed and tested. The <italic>UAS-osk</italic> control transgene is similar to <italic>UAS-GFP</italic>, except that the coding region is now from an <italic>osk</italic> cDNA (with none of the <italic>osk</italic> 3&#x02032; UTR). <italic>UAS-osk-312</italic> differs from <italic>UAS-osk</italic> by the addition of four tandem copies of the synthetic <italic>miR-312</italic> binding site. When expressed in the ovary using the <italic>matalpha4-GAL-VP16</italic> driver, the <italic>UAS-osk</italic> control transgene produces ectopic Osk, which disrupts anterior embryonic body patterning resulting in a very high frequency of bicaudal embryos (96&#x00025;; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;131)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). In contrast, expression of the <italic>UAS-osk-312</italic> transgene with the <italic>miR-312</italic> binding sites has no significant effect on embryonic patterning: the vast majority of embryos (94&#x00025;; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;373) appear wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>). Both transgene mRNAs are present at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g001">Fig. 1H</xref>). Thus, in each of two assays the addition of <italic>miR-312</italic> binding sites to an mRNA leads to its translational repression.</p><p>Translational repression of the reporter mRNAs could be due to the action of miRNAs, or could arise in some other manner because of the addition to the reporter mRNA of the sequences that make up the <italic>miR-312</italic> binding sites. To distinguish between these options we asked if miRNAs are required for the observed repression of the GFP reporter mRNA. Loquacious (Loqs) protein acts in processing pre-miRNAs, and <italic>loqs</italic> mutants are defective in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Forstemann1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

The higher resolution images reveal that both AGO::GFP fusion proteins are distributed in many small puncta that are fairly evenly spread throughout the cytoplasm (examples of individual puncta are indicated by arrows).

This distribution is not characteristic of GFP fusion proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Morin1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the distribution is distinctly different from that of GFP alone, which is more uniform in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). As a quantitative measure of the difference between the patterns of GFP and the AGO::GFP fusion protein distributions, we evaluated the range of fluorescence intensities. A uniform protein distribution in a given field should show a narrow range of fluorescence intensity. In contrast, a protein that is concentrated in particles should show a broader range of intensities: low outside of the particles, and high in the particles. Fluorescence intensities were assigned colors in a look up table (LUT)(see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g003">Fig. 3</xref> legend). The variation in fluorescence intensity is much greater for AGO1::GFP and AGO2::GFP than for GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>'&#x02013;C'). This variation confirms that both AGO fusion proteins are concentrated at many small foci. In a direct comparison of protein distributions by immunostaining of fixed egg chambers, AGO1 was detected in tiny foci similar in number and distribution to those detected with AGO1::GFP in live samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>), while Bruno (Bru; a sponge body component; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Snee1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Snee2">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>) was largely non-overlapping and predominantly in the much larger sponge bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g003">Fig. 3F,G</xref>).

The absence of any enrichment of AGO1 and AGO2 proteins (or GFP fusions of these proteins) in sponge bodies suggests that sponge bodies are not the primary destination for mRNAs under miRNA control. The many small foci of AGO proteins in the cytoplasm are good candidates for sites of repression. However, it is also possible that the lower level of more uniformly distributed AGO proteins comprise the fraction actively engaged in regulation. We therefore took another approach to more directly monitor sites of miRNA action in the ovary.</p><p>Using a tethering assay, control mRNAs and mRNAs under miRNA repression were tracked in live samples. In this type of assay, a fusion protein consisting of an RNA binding domain and GFP is tethered to an mRNA bearing the appropriate RNA binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Bertrand1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the absence of any transcripts with the MS2 binding sites, the MCP::GFP protein is largely nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) as it contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS). However, when reporter transcripts with MCP binding sites (with or without <italic>miR-312</italic> target sites) are also present, the MCP::GFP adopts a new distribution: it is now predominantly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004669-g004">Fig. 4B,C</xref>). The shift to the cytoplasm presumably results from nuclear export of reporter mRNAs. Bound molecules of MCP::GFP are thus moved into the cytoplasm, reducing the fraction of MCP::GFP in the nuclei. The UAS/GAL4 expression system allows for high levels of transcription, and it is therefore not surprising that the reporter transcripts can influence the balance of MCP::GFP between the nucleus and cytoplasm.</p><fig id="pone-0004669-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004669.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Sites of miRNA action in the ovary.</title><p>Panels A&#x02013;C show the distribution of MCP::GFP in nurse cells of live stage 10A egg chambers, with higher magnification images of cytoplasmic regions in A'&#x02013;C'.

We tested this prediction by double labeling.

The miRNA <italic>miR-312</italic> is expressed during oogenesis, and addition of synthetic <italic>miR-312</italic> binding sites to either of two different reporter mRNAs reduces their activities. This effect is dependent on the ability of the ovary to synthesize miRNAs. Collectively, these results make a compelling case for activity of miRNAs in the ovary. Furthermore, the data show that the stages when miRNA dependent regulation occurs include the mid to late stages of oogenesis, when post-transcriptional control of gene expression plays a crucial role in the events that lead to patterning of the embryo. Thus, miRNAs have the potential to contribute to this process.</p><p>Although we have focused only on a single miRNA, many of the known miRNAs are present at high levels in early stage embryos that have not initiated zygotic transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Aravin1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, and these miRNAs should also be present in the germ line cells of the ovary. Our evidence shows that the miRNA machinery is competent for function during oogenesis, and it would be very unlikely that only <italic>miR-312</italic> can make use of that machinery. Thus, there is every expectation that in oogenesis numerous miRNAs are actively engaged in regulation and many mRNAs are regulated by miRNAs.</p><p>To address the question of where in the ovary miRNA-mediated translational repression occurs, we monitored the distribution of AGO proteins and reporter mRNAs under miRNA control. Using high resolution confocal microscopy and detection either by immunofluorescence in fixed ovaries or live imaging of an AGO1::GFP fusion, we find that AGO1 is present in many small foci rather than being uniformly dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. A similar pattern is observed for reporter mRNAs detected by indirect labeling with tethered GFP, independent of whether they are under miRNA control. The AGO1-containing foci are distinct from those containing the regulated reporter mRNAs. Thus, the significance of the small foci remains uncertain.</p><p>The main conclusion of this portion of our work is that sponge bodies are not the primary sites of miRNA activity. Notably, neither AGO1 nor the repressed mRNAs display any detectable concentration in sponge bodies (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Findley1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>). Sponge bodies are similar to P bodies, with many shared components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Wilhelm1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Delanoue1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In some other cell types P bodies are enriched in miRNP components, and can readily be seen as bright foci on a darker background when either miRNP protein components or regulated mRNAs are detected with fluorescent labels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Pillai1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Sen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Liu1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. This enrichment initially suggested that a major fraction of the miRNP components are in P bodies. However, subsequent quantitative analyses revealed that only a very small fraction (less than 2&#x00025;) of the miRNP AGO protein is in the P bodies, and that the vast majority of the protein is in the cytoplasm but diffuse and therefore more difficult to detect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Leung1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. By way of comparison, then, our failure to detect any enrichment of AGO1 or transcripts under miRNA control in sponge bodies indicates that the fraction present must be substantially less than the 2&#x00025; of the cited example; in effect, there can be essentially no enrichment at all.</p><p>The distribution of miRNPs within the cell is relevant to the mechanism by which translation is repressed by miRNAs. P bodies lack ribosomes, and the presence of certain miRNPs and their regulated mRNAs within P bodies indicates that these mRNAs are not undergoing translation. This fits well with some models for miRNA-dependent repression, in which the initiation of translation is inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Pillai1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Chendrimada1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. There is also evidence for regulation by miRNAs after initiation of translation, with the repressed mRNAs being associated with polysomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Maroney1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Petersen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Obviously, such a mechanism could not apply for the mRNAs found in P bodies. Consequently, any enrichment of miRNPs in sponge bodies (whose similarity with P bodies includes an almost complete lack of ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-WilschBrauninger1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>), would be consistent with repression blocking initiation of translation. The observed absence of such an enrichment raises the possibility that whatever mechanism delivers miRNPs to the P bodies is not operating in the germline cells of the ovary (where the sponge bodies are found), at least for the developmental stages examined. While this does not rule out miRNA-dependent translational repression at the level of initiation, it does leave open the possibility that action of miRNAs after initiation of translation may be more prominent in this setting than in cells with conventional P bodies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids</title><p><italic>UAS-GFP</italic> (p8508) is pUASp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Rorth1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref> to which <italic>mGFP6</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004669-Leung1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref> has been introduced as an Asp718 fragment into the Asp718 site.
