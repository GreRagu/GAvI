Twenty-four AR guinea pigs were divided into four groups, 6 in each: Saline control group, AR sensitized group, Hemin treated group, and Zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) treated group. The frequency of sneezing and nose rubbing was recorded. Leukocyte infiltration in nasal lavage fluid, serum IgE level and plasma CO were measured.

Important roles of CO have been identified in many physiological and pathological processes relating to vasomotion, cell growth, even apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. CO is mainly produced by enzyme heme oxygenase (HO), which has been found to be expressed in almost all human tissues and organs. HO consists of three isozymes: HO-1, HO-2 and HO-3. HO-1, which is known as inducible form of heat shock protein 32 (HSP32), has been implicated in the regulation of respiratory tract inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. HO-2 is constitutively expressed in many mammalian cells. HO-3 is also a constitutive isoform of HO. Both HO expression and CO level in the airways increase in response to hypoxic challenge and to a wide variety of inflammatory stimuli such as asthma and allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and the expression of HO-1, but not HO-2, is upregulated in the nasal mucosa with allergic rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In some airway inflammations such as asthma, induction of HO-1 may lead to highly exhaled CO concentrations, which is often observed and closely associated with chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, information about CO-induced effects involved in allergic rhinitis airway inflammation is rarely documented. The current study was designed to investigate the role of HO-1 in allergic rhinitis. Hemin (Ferriprotoporphyrin IX chloride), an iron containing metalloporphyrin and a substrate for HO-1, was used to increase CO level and expression of HO-1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. HO antagonist, zine protoporphyrin (ZnPP) was used to down-regulate HO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The frequencies of sneezing and nose rubbing of guinea pigs, which represented nasal irritation, were recorded. As symbol of inflammation, levels of leukocyte infiltration in nasal lavage fluid and IgE in serum were detected. Thus, our study may facilitate a better understanding of the formation of HO-1-mediated inflammation in allergic rhinitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials and animal models</title><p>Twenty-four adult healthy male Hartley guinea pigs (230&#x02013;280 g) were purchased from National Rodent Laboratory Animal Resources, Shanghai Branch, China. Animal models of allergic rhinitis were prepared according to the method from Al Suleimani M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Guinea pigs(n = 18) were initially exposed to 1% ovalbumin (10 mg/kg, Sigma Inc.MD) in saline given as a 1% aerosol twice for 10 min each, 7 days apart. On days 14, 15 and 16, a booster of 1% ovalbumin in saline was instilled intranasally at a volume of 20 &#x003bc;l/nostril/day into both nostrils. On day 21 guinea pigs were challenged with 2% ovalbumin in saline instilled intranasally at a volume of 20 &#x003bc;l/nostril in each nostril. Eighteen guinea pigs were sensitized and divided into three groups. In the first group, animals(n = 6) were challenged intranasally with 2% ovalbumin. In the second group, named as Hemin group, animals(n = 6) were intraperitoneally administered Hemin (Sigma Inc.MD) at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day 12 h after every nose inspiration with ovalbumin and continual for two weeks. In the third group, named as ZnPP group, animals(n = 6) were intraperitoneally dministered ZnPP (Sigma Inc.MD) at a dose of 6 mg/kg/day immediately after every nose inspiration with ovalbumin and continual for two weeks too. Control animals(n = 6) were initially exposed to saline given as an aerosol twice for 10 min each at first stage, then were intranasally challenged by saline under the same conditions at a volume of 20 &#x003bc;l/nostril in each nostril at second stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Observation of sneezing and nose rubbing and assessment of leukocyte infiltration</title><p>Frequencies of sneezing and nose rubbing were assessed as previously described by Al Suleimani M with modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The numbers of sneezing and nose rubbing were counted for 30 min directly following nasal challenge. A sneeze was characterized by an explosive expiration just after deep inspiration. A nose rub was characterized by an external perinasal scratch with the animal's forelimbs. Nasal lavage fluid (NLF) was collected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] at 1 h post-challenge. Nasal cavities were washed with 2 ml of pre-warmed saline infused from the tracheal side. NLF was collected from the anterior naris. Total cell count was assessed using a standard hemocytometer. Leukocytes were counted under light microscope at power 40&#x000d7;, using the following formula: Number of cells/ml = total number of cell counted &#x000d7; dilution factor &#x000d7; 1000/total volume counted (0.1 mm3)</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of Plasma CO and serum IgE</title><p>Guinea pigs were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital (40 mg/Kg). 1 ml blood was collected from the heart through direct cardiac puncturatio, avoiding air contact. Concentration of COHb, which represented CO content in plasma, was measured using gas chromatography as described by Chalmers with spectrometer (Lambda Bio, Perkin Elmer Inc, MD)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The guinea pigs were sacrificed by rapid decapitation, and blood and nasal mucosa were collected. Biopsies of nasal mucosa were taken from the inferior turbinate and put in liquid nitrogen immediately. Some of the nasal mucosa were fixed in 10% formalin for immunohistochemistry analysis. Serum IgE levels of guinea pigs were determined by ELISA methods (RB Inc.MD).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry assay</title><p>Tissues from the specimens were fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Immunohistochemical stains were performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded 4 &#x003bc;m sections. The tissue sections were deparaffined, and antigen retrieval conditions included 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in an 800-W microwave oven for 15 minutes. The sections were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxidase to quench endogenous tissue peroxidase for 5 minutes. The tissue sections were then incubated with a rabbit monoclonal antibody against HO-1 for 30 minutes at room temperature (1:1000 dilutions, Santa Cruz Inc.MD). The slides were stained in an automated immunostainer using a standard avidin-biotin complex staining procedure. Negative controls were performed for all cases and consisted of identically prepared slides that were treated with antibody diluents in place of primary antibody, but otherwise subjected to the same immunohistochemical staining protocol.</p><p>For quantification of HO-1 immunoreactivity, high resolution digital images were obtained from each biopsy, so that the entire mucosal area was captured. The immunoreactive score was applied for calculating the immunoreactivity of HO-1, which equaled the product of the percentage of positive cells times the average staining intensity. Percentage of positive cells was graded as follows: 0 = negative, 1 = up to 10% positive cells, 2 = 11 to 50%, 3 = 51 to 80%, 4 = &#x0003e;80%. Staining intensity of 0 = negative, 1 = weakly positive, 2 = moderately positive, 3 = strongly positive.</p></sec><sec><title>Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis</title><p>Samples of nasal mucosa were shipped and stored at -80&#x000b0;C.

Then the incubation of cDNA and primer was performed at 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min, and the PCR reaction proceeded for 45 cycles: 95&#x000b0;C for 20 s, 57&#x000b0;C for 20 s, and 72&#x000b0;C for 20 s, and a final incubation at 72&#x000b0;C for 7 min in a programmable thermal cycler (Line-Gene real-time PCR detection system, bioer Inc, China) using a thermostable Taq DNA polymerase (SYBR PrimeScript Ex Taq, TaKaRa Inc, Japan). Fluorescent product was measured by a single acquisition at 86&#x000b0;C after each cycle. After the completion of PCR amplification, a melting curve analysis was performed.

Therefore, the endogenous CO may take part in the pathogenic process of AR and is positively correlated with expression of HO-1 in nasal mucosa.</p><p>Positive HO-1 expression can be seen in the cytoplasm of seromucous glands, mesenchymal cells and inflammatory cells in lamina, but not in the nasal respiratory epithelium of sensitized guinea pigs, which confirms early observation of Elhini A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. HO-1 up-regulation in seromucous glands within the submucosal layer suggests that HO-1 may play a role locally at submucosal level rather than epithelial level. Positive expression also can be seen in cytoplasm of vascular endothelial cells. In the research of Pitkin L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], immunohistochemistry for HO-1 had revealed distinctly positive staining in vascular endothelial cells and erythrocytes in nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis patient. Up-regulation of local HO-1 production in allergic nasal submucosa indicates that CO may be involved in the inflammatory process of allergic rhinitis at the submucosal level, and perhaps contribute to the increase of nasal irrigation. Increased expression of HO-1 in submucosal layer of nasal mucosa of Hemin treated group is likely to be related to the oversupply of substrate. HO-1 antagonist ZnPP attenuated the expression of HO-1 in nasal mucosa. These results indicated that Hemin and ZnPP successfully influenced immunoreactivity of HO-1 in nasal mucosa.</p><p>This study is the first to show that HO-1 expression in nasal mucosa was up-regulated by Hemin in vivo in allergic rhinitis, accompanied by increased sneezing frequency and number of nose rubbing. There was a marked increase in total cell count (p &#x0003c; 0.01) in lavage fluid especially eosinophil and neutrophil. Hemin increases level of plasma CO and number of infiltrating cells via HO-1 induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Cellular levels of free heme are approximately 100 nM or less. Higher amounts can be injurious, and kidney and other organs can be injured by increased amounts of heme from heme proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], so low concentration of Hemin was chosen and only continual used for two weeks. Research of Andersson JA had shown that low concentrations of hemin (10<sup>-11 </sup>m to 10<sup>-9 </sup>m) enhanced the migratory response of neutrophils, whereas higher concentrations (10<sup>-7 </sup>m to 10<sup>-5 </sup>m) inhibited migration. In this study, both plasma CO level and HO-1 expression of guinea pigs were significantly increased after Hemin treated, even more eosinophil and neutrophil were induced accompanied by aggravation of symptoms of AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. ZnPP as an analog of heme can play a prominent role in the catabolism of heme and cause decreased HO activity and CO formation. Administration of ZnPP to rats leads to its deposition in a variety of organs (plasma, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and brain), causing decreased HO activity and CO formation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Our findings also showed that HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP suppressed the expression of HO-1 of nasal mocusa and level of CO in vivo. In our study, ZnPP attenuated airway hyperreactivity including decrease of sneezing frequency, nose rubbing, and inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration.</p><p>CO can serve as intracellular and intercellular signaling molecules similar to NO. It is able to bind to iron atom of the heme moiety associated with soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), thereby increasing intracellular cGMP product. This result leads to protein phosphorylation and ion channels regulation, and finally to cell relaxation accompanied by the outflow of K<sup>+ </sup>increase and the influx of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>reduce[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It also can activate the protein kinase G (PKG) and affect the protein kinase A (PKA) activity and KCa channel, resulting in the inhibition of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx of vascular smooth muscle cells to reduce the intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration, and further leads to the vasodilatation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>CO may have pro-inflammatory effects since it is also a potent vasodilator and may increase plasma exudation from airway vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. CO can elicit important physiological responses like bronchial relaxation and vasodilation in asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, the anti-inflammatory effect of endogenous CO is closely related to the expression of HO-1, and expression of HO-1 has been described as a marker of response to oxidative stress. The oxidant stress associated with HO-1 upregulation in the ovalbumin-challenged guinea pigs could contribute to an induction in the number of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes in the nasal cavity. HO-1 is induced in various cells inferior to subepithelial region such as vascular endothelial cells, gland cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells in the nasal mucosa. The induction of HO-1 has been implicated as an antioxidant defense mechanism and has been associated with inflammation of airway disease include adult respiratory distress syndrome, oxidant-induced lung injury, and chronic inflammatory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The inducible HO-1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step of heme oxidation to biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and iron. Apart from the physiological role of CO, other metabolites of HO, such as bilirubin, acts as an antioxidant directly by its peroxyl radical-scavenging properties as well as by decreasing inflammatory cell recruitment during airway inflammation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; and the other metabolic product, such as ferrous ion, also acts as an potent antioxidant for cell protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>There was a significant increase of serum IgE level in AR group as compared with control. The increase of IgE level during allergic reactions has long been recognized as an important step in immediate hypersensitivity reactions to antigen. High serum IgE levels also can be seen in hemin and ZnPP treated group, but without significant changes as compared with ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs (p &#x0003e; 0.05). The results indicate that endogenous CO takes part in the pathogenesis of AR mainly through regulating cGMP production, affecting vascular dilation, glandular secretion, and cytokines or chemokines migration, rather than influencing the IgE-mediated immune response process. However, such a hypothesis has not yet been elucidated and further research is needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Findings of this study implicate a direct involvement of CO in the inflammatory process of allergic rhinitis and the effect of CO may attribute to the action of HO-1. HO-1 acts as an important modulator of the inflammatory response in upper airway in allergic rhinitis. Understanding of these mechanisms is essential for future therapeutic strategies and the successful treatment of the allergic rhinitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YSQ and ZRX designed and performed the study.
