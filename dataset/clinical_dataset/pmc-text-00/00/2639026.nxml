near Turpan, Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region, China have recently been excavated to reveal the 2700-year-old grave of a Caucasoid shaman whose accoutrements included a large cache of cannabis, superbly preserved by climatic and burial conditions. A multidisciplinary international team demonstrated through botanical examination, phytochemical investigation, and genetic deoxyribonucleic acid analysis by polymerase chain reaction that this material contained tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component of cannabis, its oxidative degradation product, cannabinol, other metabolites, and its synthetic enzyme, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase, as well as a novel genetic variant with two single nucleotide polymorphisms. The cannabis was presumably employed by this culture as a medicinal or psychoactive agent, or an aid to divination. To our knowledge, these investigations provide the oldest documentation of cannabis as a pharmacologically active agent, and contribute to the medical and archaeological record of this pre-Silk Road culture.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Archaeology</kwd><kwd>botany</kwd><kwd>cannabis</kwd><kwd>cannabinoids</kwd><kwd>archaeobotany</kwd><kwd>ethnopharmacology</kwd><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd>medical history</kwd><kwd>phytochemistry</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Uighur farmers cultivating the land at the base of the Huoyan Shan (&#x02018;Flaming Mountains&#x02019;) in the Gobi Desert near Turpan, Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region, China some 20 years ago uncovered a vast ancient cemetery (54 000 m<sup>2</sup>) that seemingly corresponds to the nearby Aidinghu, Alagou, and Subeixi excavations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma and Wang, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Hiebert, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis-Kimball, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamberi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">An, 2008</xref>) (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern260/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online) attributed to the <italic>G&#x0016b;sh&#x0012b;</italic> culture (later rendered J&#x000fc;shi, or Cheshi) (Academia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Turfanica, 2006</xref>). The first written reports concerning this clan, drafted about 2000 years <sc>BP</sc> (before present) in the Chinese historical record, <italic>Hou Hanshu,</italic> described nomadic light-haired blue-eyed Caucasians speaking an Indo-European language (probably a form of Tocharian, an extinct Indo-European tongue related to Celtic, Italic, and Anatolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma and Sun, 1994</xref>). The <italic>G&#x0016b;sh&#x0012b;</italic> tended horses and grazing animals, farmed the land and were accomplished archers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mallory and Mair, 2000</xref>). The site is centrally located in the Eurasian landmass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>), 2500 km from any ocean and located in the Ayding Lake basin, the second lowest spot on Earth after the Dead Sea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A, B</xref>).

Other evidence from chipped stone tools and other items indicate a possible human presence in the area for some 10 000&#x02013;40 000 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamberi, 1998</xref>; Academia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Turfanica, 2006</xref>). Due to a combination of deep graves (2 m or more), an extremely arid climate (16 mm annual rainfall), and alkaline soil conditions (pH 8.6&#x02013;9.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pan, 1996</xref>), the remarkable preservation of the human remains resulted in the mummification of many bodies without a need for chemical methods.

His burial as a disarticulated skeleton, as opposed to a mummified body as more frequently was found, suggested that he probably died in the highlands of the <italic>Ti&#x00101;n Sh&#x00101;n</italic> (<italic>&#x02018;</italic>Heavenly Mountains,&#x02019; or <italic>T&#x000e4;ngri Tagh</italic> in Uighur) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), and his bones were later interred at Yanghai, as nearby tombs contained large timbers of <italic>Picea</italic> (spruce) spp. that grow at 3000 m elevation. Modern Uighur pastoralists follow a similar annual migratory path to summer grazing lands some 60&#x02013;80 km distant from the tombs. Near the head and foot of the shaman's bier lay a large leather basket and wooden bowl (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern260/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S5A, B</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online) filled with 789 g of vegetative matter, initially thought to be <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> L.

An initial radiocarbon date of 2500 years <sc>BP</sc> has subsequently been corrected to a calibrated figure of 2700 years <sc>BP</sc> based on additional analyses of equestrian gear and correlation to tree ring data (dendrochronology) in China. While an earlier publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) emphasized morphological features in identifying the cannabis, the current study used additional botanical, phytochemical, and genetic investigations to demonstrate that this cannabis was psychoactive and probably cultivated for medicinal or divinatory purposes. Great care was taken to prevent contamination of the sample throughout the analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Photomicrography methods</title><p>Upon courier delivery from China, a polythene bag containing 11 g of ancient cannabis was sterilized with ethanol, handled with laboratory gloves in a laminar-flow hood, and transferred with a clean metal spatula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Two levels of light microscopy were used in this study. For the observations on the achenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>), a low power Brunel MX3 microscope (Chippenham, Wiltshire, UK) was used and a &#x000d7;3 objective utilized in conjunction with an Olympus SP350 8 megapixel camera, stereo insert 30 mm lens tube, and Photonic PL2000 &#x02013; double arm cold light source. Greater magnification was required for more detailed observations of trichomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B, C</xref>): a high power stereo light microscope with a Trinocular Head for camera attachment (STE UK, Sittingbourne, Kent, UK) with an eye piece graticule for specimen size measurement fitted with &#x000d7;4, &#x000d7;10, and &#x000d7;40 objectives.

For these, small pieces of plant tissue were placed directly onto the low-power microscope plate. When using the high power microscope, samples were dry mounted on a glass slide. To achieve views where large proportions of the material were simultaneously in focus, flat samples specimens (as shown) gave the greatest success.</p><p>On the low power microscope the seed sample was illuminated with incident light, using a Photonic PL2000 &#x02013; double arm &#x02018;cold light source&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>). Some samples, when placed on the high power microscope, were also illuminated using the cold light source. Others were illuminated from below. When viewing samples mounted beneath a cover slip, it is common to set up a microscope using the K&#x000f6;hler illumination method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delly, 1988</xref>). This ensured that light from the condenser lens was focused correctly on the microscope slide. For uncovered specimens, the condenser height and aperture were adjusted while viewing the subject until optimum resolution was achieved. In all cases, the specimens were measured using a graticule within the eyepiece.</p><p>To enable photographs to be taken through the low power microscope, one eyepiece was replaced with a compatible 30 mm lens tube to which single lens reflex or digital cameras would be attached. As in ordinary photography, the depth of field is considered to be the distance from the nearest object plain to the farthest object plain that is in focus. When objects are a long distance from the camera lens the depth of field is large. However, depth decreases as the image comes closer to the lens. When taking photomicrographs, depth of field is measured in microns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delly, 1988</xref>). To maximize the chance of finding substantial areas of tissue simultaneously in focus within this narrow depth of field, multiple samples were laid as flat as possible onto glass slides. In all cases, photomicrographs were taken on a solid bench and the shutter activated remotely to reduce manually-induced camera-shake.</p><p>In no instance was any image modification technique used in these photographs.</p></sec><sec><title>Phytochemistry methods</title><p>Approximately 2 g of the dried plant material was extracted with 200 ml methanol:chloroform (9:1 v/v) by sonication at room temperature (21 &#x000b0;C), the standard extractive technique for this laboratory (GW Pharmaceuticals), a method that recruits &#x0003e;95% of phytocannabinoid content. The solvent layer was then transferred through a paper filter into a rotary evaporator flask. The flask was evaporated to dryness at 40 &#x000b0;C, under reduced pressure, prior to resuspension in 4 ml of methanol:dichloromethane (3:1 v/v). This sample was transferred to two autosampler vials to be analysed by GC-FID-MS and HPLC-UV. At all stages, the clean glassware was extracted with the same solvents to ensure that none of the observed peaks would be a result of contamination. GC-FID-MS analyses were performed on a HP6890 gas chromatograph, coupled to a 5975 inert mass spectrometer. The system was controlled with Agilent MSD chemstation D.03.00.611. The GC was fitted with a Zebron fused silica capillary column (30 m&#x000d7;0.32 mm inner diameter) coated with ZB-5 at a film thickness of 0.25 &#x003bc;m (Phenomenex). The oven temperature was programmed from 70 &#x000b0;C to 305 &#x000b0;C at a rate of 5 &#x000b0;C min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The injector port and the transfer line were maintained at 275 &#x000b0;C and 300 &#x000b0;C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a pressure of 55 kPa. The injection split ratio was 5:1. HPLC profiles were obtained using an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system controlled by Chemstation version A09.03 software. Cannabinoid profiles were generated using a C<sub>18</sub> (150&#x000d7;4.6 mm, 5 &#x003bc;m) analytical column fitted with a C<sub>18</sub> (10&#x000d7;4.6 mm, 5 &#x003bc;m) guard column. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile, 0.25% w/v acetic acid and methanol at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and the column was kept at 35 &#x000b0;C. The UV profiles were recorded at 220 nm.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic methods</title><p>DNA was extracted from pulverized dried leaves, from two seeds probably belonging to <italic>Cannabis</italic> spp., and from three seeds probably from other unidentified species. The DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used, according to the Qiagen protocol, but with some modification to increase the final DNA amount and to avoid external and artificial contamination. For this reason, pre-PCR and post-PCR operations were physically separated and carried out in different environments. Ancient DNA extraction and other pre-PCR works were performed under a UV-filtered ventilation system and a positive pressure airflow. Filtered pipette tips and sterile tubes and plastics were always used; gloves, masks, and laboratory coats were always worn. The quality of DNA obtained was estimated by <italic>A</italic><sub>260</sub>/<italic>A</italic><sub>280</sub> absorbance ratio. In order to obtain the highest possible fidelity during PCR synthesis, PCR reactions were performed using the Pwo Master ready-to-use proofreading master mix (Roche Applied Science) according to their protocol. The primers designed to test DNA integrity and suitability for PCR analysis and species identification were from the ITS region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blattner, 1999</xref>), and from a non-coding region of chloroplast DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taberlet <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>). The reaction mixtures were subjected firstly to an initial heat denaturation at 94 &#x000b0;C for 3 min; then, they were subjected to 35 cycles of heat denaturation at 94 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 1 min of primer annealing at 55 &#x000b0;C for the ITS region, and 50 &#x000b0;C for cpDNA, and DNA extension at 72 &#x000b0;C for 40 s. Finally, the samples were maintained at 72 &#x000b0;C for 5 min for the final extension. PCR reactions were performed in an MJ Research PTC-100 thermal cycler (MJ Research, USA). The amplification products were separated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. The bands were excised and purified with the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). PCR-purified products were quantified and directly forward- and reverse-sequenced, using the GenomeLab&#x02122; Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing with a Quick Start Kit on a CEQ8000 Genetic analyser (Beckman Coulter). Primer sequences were identified and removed manually, and database searches were performed with the BLASTN algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altschul <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>). The sequences results proved that the pulverized dried tissue was from <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L., despite our observation in the mixed sample of some small seeds of different species, removed before the DNA extraction; no differences were observed between the sequences obtained and those deposited at the NCBI gene-bank (for THCA-and CBDA-synthases, GeneBank accession numbers E55108/GI 18529739 and E33091/GI 18623981). By contrast, no amplification was obtained from DNA extracted from seeds of both cannabis and the other, unidentified species. The allelic status at a single locus, <italic>B</italic>, known to be the major gene determining the CBD/THC ratio in cannabis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Meijer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), was investigated in the ancient material. The primer pairs described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Meijer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) are not sufficiently associated with the chemotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pacifico <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and the sequence-based primers described therein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pacifico <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) failed to yield any amplification, probably due to the limited integrity of DNA from ancient cannabis tissues, which did not sustain the amplification of a 1100 Da DNA fragment. Therefore, three different primer pairs (Fw150&#x000d7;Rev328, Fw166&#x000d7;Rev318, and Fw154&#x000d7;Rev318) were used. These primers were designed on two conserved small regions of a zone varying between the known sequences of THC and CBD alleles. When tested on fresh cannabis tissues, these primers were demonstrated to be able to amplify both alleles (PCR and sequences data not shown). Using different primer pair combinations, the risk of a no-match or a mismatch because of possible mutations in the 3&#x02032; end of primer region was overcome. The primer sequences are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern260/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S8</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online. All reaction mixtures were subjected first to heat denaturation at 94 &#x000b0;C for 3 min and then to 35 cycles consisting of heat denaturation at 94 &#x000b0;C for 15 s, primer annealing at 54 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, and DNA extension at 72 &#x000b0;C for 1 min.

The extraction of 2 g of plant material produced 67.9 mg of solids after the removal of solvents. Using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the largest cannabinoid peak was cannabinol (CBN) at 7.4 min, but concentration levels were very low, averaging 0.007% w/w. CBN is an oxidative breakdown product THC, generated non-enzymatically, with increasing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenneisen, 2007</xref>). There were also peaks corresponding to expected retention times for cannabidiol (CBD) at 4.9 min and cannabichromene (CBC) at 12 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Both are phytocannabinoids resulting from alternative enzymatic pathways than that yielding THC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Meijer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). There were very few peaks in the first 20 min of the gas chromatogram where mono- and sesquiterpenes elute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). This lack of terpenoid volatiles supports the physical observation that the plant material lacked the herbal smell traditionally associated with cannabis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McPartland and Russo, 2001</xref>).

The major peaks in the 13&#x02013;30.5 min region are free fatty acids (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern260/DC1">Supplementary Fig.S7A</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). The largest peak identified as palmitic acid was the most abundant in the sample. Methyl and propyl cannabinoids eluted in the 27&#x02013;30 min region and the peaks marked as 286 Da and 302 Da all had MS spectra consistent with propyl cannabinoids. There were two phthalate peaks at approximately 23.5 min (believed to have originated from the polythene bags in which the samples were supplied). A number of phytocannabinoids were identified in the 30&#x02013;34 min region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>) including cannabidiol (CBD), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabicyclol (CBL, a heat-generated artefact of CBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenneisen, 2007</xref>), and cannabinavarin (CBNV, a propyl analogue of CBN). In the 34&#x02013;36.3 min region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>), apart from cannabinol (CBN), the largest individual phytocannabinoid component, there were at least four peaks of 330 Da with cannabielsoin (CBE, an artefact derived from CBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenneisen, 2007</xref>) a likely identification of the peak at 34.2 min.

These results also prove that both sequences encode for THCA synthase, the biosynthetic enzyme for THCA that decarboxylates via heat or ageing to yield psychoactive THC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Russo, 2007</xref>). Direct comparison of the two ancient sequences, identified the nature of the small differences observed: the samples have two &#x02018;mutations&#x02019; (highlighted in yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A</xref>), which can be considered transversions: from guanine to cytosine, and from cytosine to adenine. The first of these two nucleotide substitutions is synonymous, i.e. it does not change the amino acid sequence, while the second one is a non-synonymous substitution, leading to a serine-threonine exchange (highlighted in light blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B</xref>) in the encoded amino acid sequence; these two amino acids, however, have similar physico-chemical properties. No CBDA synthase, the biosynthetic enzyme for CBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Meijer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), was identified in the sample.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results presented collectively point to the most probable conclusion which is that the <italic>G&#x0016b;sh&#x0012b;</italic> culture cultivated cannabis for pharmaceutical, psychoactive or divinatory purposes. In examining the botanical evidence from this &#x02018;old and cold&#x02019; site with its unique degree of preservation, the cannabis consisted of a processed (pounded) sample whose seed size, colour, and morphology, at least according to principles of Vavilov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vavilov, 1926</xref>), suggest that it was cultivated rather than merely gathered from wild plants. The considerable amount of cannabis present (789 g) without any large stalks or branches would logically imply a pooled collection rather than one from a single plant. Importantly, no obvious male cannabis plant parts (e.g. staminate flowers, not infrequently observed in Indian herbal cannabis, or <italic>bhang</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Russo, 2007</xref>) were evident, implying their exclusion or possible removal by human intervention, as these are pharmacologically less psychoactive.</p><p>The HPLC, GC, and MS analyses confirm the identity of the supplied plant sample as <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L. The predominance of CBN indicates that the original plants contained &#x00394;<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as the major phytocannabinoid constituent. The presence of CBO and numerous CBN-related substance peaks further supports this view. CBD and CBC, together with their known thermo-oxidative degradation products CBE and CBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenneisen, 2007</xref>), are present, but the GC analysis would appear to indicate that, in both cases, CBC and CBL are represented in greater quantities, as expected in a high-THC cannabis strain wherein CBD is only a minor component. In addition, there is a peak for CBNV which confirms that the plant also contained &#x00394;<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), a propyl phytocannabinoid. All of these observations are consistent with strains of cannabis with a high THC content and in an alternative taxonomy suggests it should be assigned to <italic>Cannabis indica</italic> Lamarck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hillig and Mahlberg, 2004</xref>).</p><p>While chromatography elution times may vary with temperature, column type, and other factors, confirmation was evident with corroboratory mass spectra values that were identical to those seen daily in assays performed on fresh cannabis extracts in this laboratory.</p><p>The presence of so many recognized cannabinoid degradants is consistent with very old cannabis samples. The very low concentration levels measured in the HPLC analysis may indicate that the sample provided contained significantly more leaf and twig material than flower material, rather than being evidence in itself that the sample was of low potency originally. This plant material is therefore conclusively cannabis derived from a population of plants within which THC was the dominant cannabinoid. By contrast, a sample taken from a mix of wild-type <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> would customarily harbour a more equal mixture of THC and CBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Meijer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). It would appear, therefore, that humans selected the material from plants on the basis of their higher than average THC content. To elaborate, a chemotaxonomy of cannabis previously outlined indicates three types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Small and Beckstead, 1973</xref>): chemotype I (drug) strains with high-THC:CBD ratios, chemotype II low-THC, higher-CBD (fibre) strains, and chemotype II with more equal ratios. THC and CBD production are mediated by co-dominant alleles B<sub>T</sub> and B<sub>D</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Meijer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). By comparison, pooled samples from cannabis fields in Morocco and Afghanistan will normally produce 25% high-THC plants, 25% high-CBD plants, and 50% with lower, mixed titres, combining to yield roughly equivalent amounts of the two phytocannabinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Russo, 2007</xref>), a pattern not observed in our specimen.</p><p>Isotopic analysis of cellulose from this cannabis sample might conceivably be used in comparison with other samples in an attempt to establish its geographic origin.</p><p>While multi-purpose cannabis plants used simultaneously for food (seed), fibre (stalks), and pharmaceutical uses (flowering tops) have been recently reported from Darchula in far western Nepal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarke, 2007</xref>), more customarily, a given plant is best suited toward a single purpose. Of additional key importance is the absence of hemp artefacts from the Yanghai Tombs. The <italic>G&#x0016b;sh&#x0012b;</italic> fabricated clothing from wool (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern260/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S6B</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online) and ropes from <italic>Phragmites</italic> (reed) spp. fibres (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ern260/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S6C</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). Whereas hemp textiles have been collected from the Northern China Yangshao Culture from 6000&#x02013;7000 years <sc>BP</sc>, their appearance in the west was not documented before 2000 years <sc>BP</sc>, for example, 1500 years <sc>BP</sc> in Kucha, 600 km west of Turpan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mallory and Mair, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Previous phytochemical analyses of antique cannabis preparations have demonstrated THC remnant fingerprints from 19th century cannabis preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harvey, 1990</xref>) including a 140-year-old sample of Squire's Extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harvey, 1985</xref>). A study in 1992 reported the presence of &#x00394;<sup>8</sup>-THC (previously termed &#x00394;<sup>6</sup>-THC) from burned cannabis that was reportedly inhaled as an aide to childbirth in a Judean cave 1700 years <sc>BP</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zias <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>), supported by the finding of cannabinoid residues in an adjacent glass vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zias, 1995</xref>). In the Mustang region of Nepal, mummified human remains of probable Mongolian ancestry have been dated 2200&#x02013;2500 years <sc>BP</sc> in association with cannabis, probably transported from elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kn&#x000f6;rzer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), but with insufficient detail to ascertain its use.

Sarianidi also claimed cannabis use in the Bactria&#x02013;Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) (present day Turkmenistan) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sarianidi, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">1998</xref>), but this interpretation has been debated (see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Russo, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Another independent genetic analysis of this material published subsequent to our analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mukherjee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) confirmed the presence of THCA synthase, but not the single nucleotide polymorphisms. The authors posited a European&#x02013;Siberian origin for the material.</p><p>Current genetic data also confirm that the plant material examined is <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L. according to ITS and cpDNA analysis. The results also support the hypothesis of the existence of at least two THCA-synthase nucleotide sequences in the ancient plant material examined. One of these sequences perfectly matches the corresponding sequence of already-known THCA-synthases deposited in GenBank, both as gene and protein sequences; the second sequence is a novel one, with two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encoding for a protein with presumably very similar characteristics. Whether these two sequences coexisted in a single cannabis plant or a strain heterozygous at the <italic>B</italic> locus, or belong to different plants, could not be concluded.</p><p>THC represents one of the possible phytocannabinoid end-products manufactured by cannabis plants; THC (or, in its native form, THCA) is synthesized by a well-characterized enzyme (THCA- or THC-synthase) from a precursor (CBG or CBGA) common to most chemotypes that represents the metabolic &#x02018;switching point&#x02019;, downstream of which the variability of the different chemotypes is concentrated. The agents of such variability found in cannabis germplasm are exclusively the different synthases, among which THC(A)-synthase is the only one responsible for making that specific cannabinoid, THC. Therefore, the presence of the allelic variant responsible for coding the THC(A)-synthase may well be considered to be diagnostic, or at least strongly suggestive of a THC-producing plant. The fossil cannabis plants found were therefore genetically equipped to produce THC. How much THC they actually produced, cannot of course be specified because they depend on a number of anatomical, environmental, and nutritional factors that remain unknown.</p><p>Numerous questions remain. Current data do not permit it to be ascertained how the cannabis from the tomb was administered. If used orally, perhaps it was combined in some fashion with <italic>Capparis spinosa</italic> L., as these plants were found together in a nearby but later tomb at Yanghai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). That date for that tomb was initially reported as 2700 years <sc>BP</sc> via radiocarbon methods, and since corrected to 2200&#x02013;2400 years <sc>BP</sc> with additional calibration employing tree ring data.
