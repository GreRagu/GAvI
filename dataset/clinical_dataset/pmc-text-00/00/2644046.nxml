Prevalence and incidence in the western world are estimated at 0.2% and 6/100 000 per year, respectively, and the disease is more prevalent among men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The disease usually starts between 15 and 30 yrs of age. Disease manifestations, such as pain and stiffness in the axial skeleton and in some cases also peripheral arthritis, enthesitis and extra-articular manifestations, contribute to impairment, activity limitation, participation restriction and reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>]. Reduced work ability leading to sick leave is a common consequence of AS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and may contribute to psychosocial and financial (direct and indirect) sequels for the individual as well as for the society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For decades the most common treatment for AS was NSAIDs and physical therapy. The treatment options have recently been broadened by TNF inhibitors with beneficial effect on disease activity, function, sick leave and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>]. Employment status in patients with AS of varying disease duration ranges between 55 and 89% in different countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Proportion of work-disabled patients with AS is reported to vary between 9 and 36% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Differences seen in employment status and work disability between countries may be partly due to differences in social security systems and different labour markets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The main purpose of this registry-based case&#x02013;control study was to investigate sick leave over a 7-yr period in a cohort of patients with AS in Malm&#x000f6;, South Sweden, compared with controls matched for age, sex and residential area. The Swedish Social Insurance Agency continuously registers compensation for sick leave paid to all residents by their unique personal identification number, and cross-referencing this registry with a disease cohort may provide the foundation for high-quality research on sick leave and health economics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><title>Definitions</title><p>According to the Swedish legislation, all residents aged 16&#x02013;64 yrs can be granted economic security from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency in the event of work incapacity owing to sickness, disability or injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

Malm&#x000f6; is a city in Sk&#x000e5;ne with a population of 230 000 individuals over the age of 15 yrs. At the time of inclusion, the rheumatology specialist care in Malm&#x000f6; comprised of the Rheumatology Department of the University Hospital in Malm&#x000f6; and three rheumatologists practicing privately in the city. These rheumatology specialists were connected to the hospital clinic by a special contract and were an integrated part of the rheumatology service and the rheumatology team in Malm&#x000f6; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Patients were identified from the outpatient registers of the Rheumatology Department of the University Hospital and the three rheumatologists practicing privately. Patients were included if they had AS according to ICD-9 (720A) or ICD-10 (M45) or, when no code was available (in two of the private practices&#x02019; registers), a written diagnosis of AS, pelvospondylitis or Mb Bechterew was present. A total of 158 patients, 120 men and 38 women, were identified. To verify the diagnosis, one of the authors (B.S.) examined their medical records and found that 36 patients, 19 men and 17 women, did not fulfil the New York criteria for diagnosis and were excluded. Thus, in all 122 patients, 101 men and 21 women were included in the study. To further validate and characterize the study sample the prevalence of uveitis was registered from the medical records and information of treatment with TNF-inhibitors was collected from the South Swedish Arthritis Treatment Group (SSATG) register [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Data contained dates of sick leave and degree of sick leave (25, 50, 75 or 100% of the day). The follow-up time for sick leave of cases and controls was from 1 January 2000 until 31 January 2007.

Our population-based case&#x02013;control study, which is to the best of our knowledge the first study presenting Swedish sick leave data for this patient category, shows an 80% increased risk of sick leave over a 7-yr period. The sick leave data were collected from an independent, reliable and identical source for both cases and controls as sick leave over 14 days for all residents leading to compensation is continuously registered by the Swedish Social Insurance Agency.</p><p>Our findings are in concordance with earlier reports, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and some of these have presented data allowing interpretation of work participation in relation to the general population. Boonen <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] described that the risk for withdrawal from work in the Netherlands was about 3-times higher in patients with AS, and that work disability in three European countries was higher than expected in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Mau <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] compared employment rates in different rheumatic diseases with the general German population and found that there were differences, but smaller than expected, especially in AS. However, the differences increased with longer disease duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The employment rate in patients with AS was higher than in patients with RA from the German rheumatological database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Due to heterogeneity of populations studied, differences in definitions of end-points and methodology used, as well as in labour markets and social security systems, comparisons between countries may be difficult to interpret.</p><p>Since patients in our study were recruited from rheumatological specialist care they can be expected to have a higher disease activity and to be more severely affected and as all the included patients fulfilled the New York criteria for the diagnosis of AS, early disease might not be included. The sick leave may therefore not be representative for the whole spectrum of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms causing the increased sick leave are multiple, with contribution by disease-related factors, work-related factors, sociodemographic factors, mental factors as well as coping styles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27 B28 B29">25&#x02013;29</xref>].

During recent years effective anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying treatment with TNF inhibitors have become increasingly available. In fact, 21% of our patients had received such therapy, which may have affected their sick leave. However, serving as a limitation, our study sample was too small to evaluate if TNF inhibitor treatment was associated with work disability. Also, our data do not include shorter periods (up to 14 days) of sick leave as these periods are directly compensated by the employer and never get registered by the Swedish Social Security Agency. It is possible that AS patients also have an increase of such brief periods of sick leave compared with controls, and therefore our estimates of increased risk may be biased towards the null.</p><p>To sum up, we have demonstrated that AS patients in Sweden have an increased sick leave level, despite the introduction of TNF inhibitors in the treatment arsenal. We also demonstrate the large potential for work disability studies that is possible by using the Swedish population-based registers for health care and social insurance benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These registers form an exciting possibility for evaluation of treatment interventions, such as team-based rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and biologic pharmacological treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="ken497b1.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Gunnel Henriksson, Thor Lithman and Dennis Nor&#x000e9;en for help with data retrieval and management and excellent technical support.</p><p><italic>Funding</italic>: The project was funded by a grant from the Regional Health Service Authorities in Sk&#x000e5;ne (Region Sk&#x000e5;ne) and the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (F&#x000f6;rs&#x000e4;kringskassan).
