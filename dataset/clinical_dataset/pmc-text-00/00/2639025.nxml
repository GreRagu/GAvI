Both processes may be regulated by changes in plant hormone concentrations. Tomato plants (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L. cv Moneymaker) were cultivated hydroponically for 3 weeks under high salinity (100 mM NaCl) and five major plant hormones (abscisic acid, ABA; the cytokinins zeatin, Z, and zeatin-riboside, ZR; the auxin indole-3-acetic acid, IAA; and the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, ACC) were determined weekly in roots, xylem sap, and leaves. Salinity reduced shoot biomass by 50&#x02013;60% and photosynthetic area by 20&#x02013;25% both by decreasing leaf expansion and delaying leaf appearance, while root growth was less affected, thus increasing the root/shoot ratio. ABA and ACC concentrations strongly increased in roots, xylem sap, and leaves after 1 d (ABA) and 15 d (ACC) of salinization. By contrast, cytokinins and IAA were differentially affected in roots and shoots. Salinity dramatically decreased the Z+ZR content of the plant, and induced the conversion of ZR into Z, especially in the roots, which accounted for the relative increase of cytokinins in the roots compared to the leaf. IAA concentration was also strongly decreased in the leaves while it accumulated in the roots. Decreased cytokinin content and its transport from the root to the shoot were probably induced by the basipetal transport of auxin from the shoot to the root. The auxin/cytokinin ratio in the leaves and roots may explain both the salinity-induced decrease in shoot vigour (leaf growth and leaf number) and the shift in biomass allocation to the roots, in agreement with changes in the activity of the sink-related enzyme cell wall invertase.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Abscisic acid</kwd><kwd>1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid</kwd><kwd>indole-3-acetic acid</kwd><kwd>plant hormones</kwd><kwd>salt stress</kwd><kwd>sodium chloride</kwd><kwd>tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.)</kwd><kwd>zeatin</kwd><kwd>zeatin-riboside</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Salinity is a major factor reducing crop productivity in agriculture as well as a major cause of the abandonment of lands and aquifers for agricultural purposes. Improving the use of such marginal resources requires insight about their limiting effects on plant development. The release of salt-tolerant crops to optimize the use of salt-contaminated water and soil resources has been a much prosecuted scientific goal but with little success to date, as few major determinant genetic traits of salt tolerance have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flowers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Munns, 2005</xref>). Although maintenance of ionic and water homeostasis is necessary for plant survival, salinity decreases crop productivity both by reducing leaf growth and inducing leaf senescence. This lowers the total photosynthetic capacity of the plant, thus limiting its ability to generate further growth or harvestable biomass and also to maintain defence mechanisms against the stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yeo, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The major physiological processes believed to be involved in the control of plant growth under salinity have been water relations, hormonal balance, and carbon supply, with their respective importance depending on the time scale of the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Munns, 2002</xref>). Salinity affects plant growth in two phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Munns, 1993</xref>). During the initial phase of salinity, the osmotic effect predominates and induces water stress due to the high salt concentration in the root medium. During this phase, shoot growth arrest occurs very quickly (seconds to minutes) but recovers (over several hours) to a new steady-state that is considerably lower than under non-stress conditions. These changes seem to be driven by changes in water relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Munns, 2002</xref>), but during this initial period when osmotic effects predominate (days to weeks), growth seems to be regulated by hormones and/or carbohydrates. During the second phase of the stress (weeks to months), growth is governed by toxic effects due to the high salt accumulation in leaf tissues.</p><p>Overall, salinity affects plant productivity by reducing the photosynthetic area by inhibiting cell division and cell expansion rates during leaf growth and by affecting developmental programmes regulating leaf emergence, the production of lateral primordia, and the formation of reproductive organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Munns, 2002</xref>). However, the mechanism(s) that down-regulates leaf growth and shoot development under the osmotic phase of salinity is not known. It has been hypothesized that leaf growth inhibition must be regulated by hormones or their precursors, because the reduced leaf growth rate is independent of carbohydrate supply, water status, nutrient deficiency, and ion toxicity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Munns and Tester, 2008</xref>, for a review). Since plant meristems are actively growing tissues where cell division governs sink strength, environmental signals can modulate plant responses to the growing conditions through changes in phytohormone concentrations, thus controlling assimilate partitioning between different sink tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartig and Beck, 2006</xref>). These hormonal changes not only influence the adaptive response but also affect the normal growth of the harvestable organs and thus influence economic productivity. Hence, plant hormones are considered a primary component of the signalling pathways controlling these processes.</p><p>This integrated plasticity in plant development probably involves long-distance communication between different organs with hormones playing an essential role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sachs, 2005</xref>) or differential changes in root and shoot hormone concentrations. Although salinity increased plant ABA concentration in all plant compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wolf <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kefu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>), its role in growth regulation has been equivocal as different studies have suggested it can inhibit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dodd and Davies, 1996</xref>) or maintain growth by restricting the evolution of ethylene, another potential growth inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sharp and LeNoble, 2002</xref>). Both cytokinins and auxins act as endogenous mitogens whose concentrations can be environmentally modulated to regulate the formation of roots and shoots and their relative growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Werner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sachs, 2005</xref>). It has been hypothesized that a decrease in CK supply from the root to the shoot could inhibit leaf growth while a low CK content would promote root growth and thus the root/shoot ratio (van der Werf and Nagel, 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rahayu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). It has been reported that salinity decreased the auxin indoleacetic acid (IAA) levels in the roots but not in the leaves of tomato plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunlap and Binzel, 1996</xref>), while leaf zeatin concentration declined under osmotic stress in tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Walker and Dumbroff, 1981</xref>). However, since many of these (relatively scarce) studies were only able to measure one or two of the major hormone groups following a step-change in salinity or any other stress, interpretation of changes in biomass allocation by specific authors has generally favoured the hormones that each author measured, and thus there are several divergent hypotheses of the regulation of biomass allocation (van der Werf and Nagel, 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Munns and Cramer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sachs, 2005</xref>) that co-exist in the literature.</p><p>The advent of multi-analyte techniques for hormone quantification allows a far more comprehensive analysis of the changes in plant hormone status following salinity. Accordingly, the endogenous concentrations of five major plant hormones; ABA, ACC, IAA, and two major active cytokinins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davey and van Staden, 1976</xref>) in tomato, Z and ZR, were analysed in leaves of a cultivated tomato genotype submitted to salinity stress (100 mM NaCl for 3 weeks), in order to study the influence of local changes in both plant hormones and ionic status on leaf senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghanem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In this study, however, root and xylem hormone concentrations were measured to evaluate whether differential hormonal changes in and between roots and shoots regulated growth and biomass partitioning under salinity. Tomato was chosen for this work since it is an economically important crop, whose cropping area (particularly in the Mediterranean) is often limited by the availability of sufficient high quality (non-saline) water for irrigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and culture conditions</title><p>Seeds of tomato (<italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.) cv. Moneymaker were obtained from the Tomato Genetics Resource Center (TGRC) (University of California-Davis, CA, USA). Seeds were sown in trays filled with a perlite-vermiculite mix (1:3 v/v proportion) moistened regularly with half-strength Hoagland's nutrient solution. Fourteen days after sowing, the substrate was gently washed from the roots and seedlings placed on polyvinyl chloride plates floating on aerated half-strength Hoagland's nutrient solution in a growth chamber. Solutions were refilled every 2 d and renewed every week.</p><p>Plants were grown in a growth chamber under a 16 h daylight period. The air temperature ranged from 25&#x02013;28 &#x000b0;C during the day and 17&#x02013;18 &#x000b0;C during the night. Relative humidity was maintained at 70&#x000b1;5% during the night and at 50&#x000b1;5% during the day. Light intensity at the top of the canopy was around 245 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (PPFD). After 4 d acclimation in control conditions (18 d after sowing), the seedlings were exposed to 0 mM (control) or 100 mM NaCl added to the nutrient solution for three more weeks. Three replications with eight plants per replication and salt treatment were used. An actively growing leaf, present at the moment that salt stress was applied (identified as leaf number 4 by numbering from the base of the plant) was tagged for subsequent growth measurements and harvest for biochemical determinations. Six plants per treatment were harvested for different analyses at 1, 9, 15, and 22 d of salt treatment. Xylem sap was obtained from three plants per treatment immediately after severing the shoot about 2&#x02013;3 cm above the root system. The root system was placed into a Scholander pressure chamber, and samples obtained by applying a nitrogen pressure similar to the leaf water potential (&#x02013;0.5 MPa for control plants and about &#x02013;0.9 MPa for stressed ones) in order to maintain sap flow rates as close as possible to whole plant transpiration rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">P&#x000e9;rez-Alfocea <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Vegetative growth assessment</title><p>Six plants per treatment were used for growth analysis. The number of leaves on the main stem with a length &#x0003e;2 cm was recorded every 2 d, and the rate of leaf appearance was estimated from the slope of leaf number versus time. At each harvest, the shoots and roots of each plant were separated and weighed to determine fresh weight (FW) and the root/shoot ratio. The area of the tagged leaf 4 was determined by using a Li-Cor 3100 area meter (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). The relative growth rate (RGR) on a FW basis, and the relative expansion rate (RER) of leaf 4, and the RGR of the root system, were evaluated as the increase in FW or leaf area per unit of FW or leaf area present per unit of time and were estimated from the equation [(lnP<italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>&#x02013;lnP<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>)/(<italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>&#x02013;t</italic><sub>1</sub>)], where P<italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> and P<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> are the values of each parameter at the end (<italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>) and at the beginning (<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>) of the corresponding growing period.</p></sec><sec><title>Hormone extraction and analysis</title><p>Cytokinins (zeatin, Z, and zeatin riboside, ZR), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and abscisic acid (ABA) were extracted and purified according to the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobrev and Kaminek (2002)</xref>. One gram of fresh plant material (leaf or root) was homogenized in liquid nitrogen and placed in 5 ml of cold (&#x02013;20 &#x000b0;C) extraction mixture of methanol/water/formic acid (15/4/1 by vol., pH 2.5). After overnight extraction at &#x02013;20 &#x000b0;C solids were separated by centrifugation (20 000 <italic>g</italic>, 15 min) and re-extracted for 30 min in an additional 5 ml of the same extraction solution. Pooled supernatants were passed through a Sep-Pak Plus &#x02020;C<sub>18</sub> cartridge (SepPak Plus, Waters, USA) to remove interfering lipids and plant pigments and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 5 ml of 1 M formic acid and loaded on an Oasis MCX mixed mode (cation-exchange and reverse phase) column (150 mg, Waters, USA) preconditioned with 5 ml of methanol followed by 5 ml of 1 M formic acid. To separate different CK forms (nucleotides, bases, ribosides, and glucosides) from IAA and ABA, the column was washed and eluted stepwise with different appropriate solutions indicated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobrev and Kaminek (2002)</xref>. ABA and IAA were analysed in the same fraction. After each solvent was passed through the columns, they were purged briefly with air. Solvents were evaporated at 40 &#x000b0;C under vacuum. Samples then dissolved in a water/acetonitrile/formic acid (94.9:5:0.1 by vol.) mixture for HPLC/MS analysis. Analyses were carried out on a HPLC/MS system consisting of an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a &#x003bc;-well plate autosampler and a capillary pump, and connected to an Agilent Ion Trap XCT Plus mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using an electrospray (ESI) interface. Prior to injection, 100 &#x003bc;l of each fraction extracted from tissues or a similar volume of xylem sap were filtered through 13 mm diameter Millex filters with 0.22 &#x003bc;m pore size nylon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). 8 &#x003bc;l of each sample, dissolved in mobile phase A, was injected onto a Zorbax SB-C18 HPLC column (5 &#x003bc;m, 150&#x000d7;0.5 mm, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), maintained at 40 &#x000b0;C, and eluted at a flow rate of 10 &#x003bc;l min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Mobile phase A, consisting of water/acetonitrile/formic acid (94.9:5:0.1 by vol.), and mobile phase B, consisting of water/acetonitrile/formic acid (10:89.9:0.1 by vol.), were used for the chromatographic separation. The elution programme maintained 100% A for 5 min, then a linear gradient from 0% to 6% B in 10 min, followed by another linear gradient from 6% to 100% B in 5 min, and finally 100% B maintained for another 5 min. The column was equilibrated with the starting composition of the mobile phase for 30 min before each analytical run. The UV chromatogram was recorded at 280 nm with a DAD module (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive mode with a capillary spray voltage of 3500 V, and a scan speed of 22 000 <italic>m/z</italic> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> from 50&#x02013;500 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>.

Shoot CK and auxins are probably involved in these processes since they were strongly reduced by salinity in the shoot tissues: about 50% for Z+ZR contents in leaf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghanem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and xylem sap, and 50&#x02013;90% for IAA during leaf development. This idea is supported by the significant correlation found between both the leaf IAA content and the IAA/(Z+ZR) ratio with leaf development under both control and saline conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the leaf CK (ZR and Z+ZR) concentrations were also positively correlated with the overall shoot growth capacity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), which may be explained not only by promoting cell division but also by delaying leaf senescence under salinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghanem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The phenotype of salinized tomato plants, where leaf CKX activity was enhanced by salinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghanem <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), was similar to that of CKX-transgenic tobacco plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Werner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), where total CK contents were also diminished compared to the wild type. In both cases, leaf growth and the leaf appearance rate were strongly reduced, suggesting that modulation of CKs through catabolism is involved in regulating leaf initiation and growth under salinity.</p><p>Auxins are also considered to be a positive factor in leaf initiation having antagonistic interactions with CKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kepinski, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shani <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Assuming that changes in leaf hormone concentration also occur in other parts of the shoot, delayed leaf appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>) could be explained by the decrease in shoot IAA concentration during the first days of salt treatment. The later recovery in leaf appearance rate coincided with the increased IAA concentration and IAA/Z+ZR ratio in the leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A, C</xref>). Since CK and auxin contents changed in parallel, it is difficult to resolve their independent effects and more functional work is needed, but it is interesting to note that both hormones could exert a major control on the leaf growth rate, as suggested from correlative analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), probably by promoting cell elongation after cell division.</p><p>Although increased leaf ABA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>) was correlated with impaired shoot development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), experiments investigating natural genetic variation in ABA concentration of salinized plants showed a positive (de Costa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007) or negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cramer and Quarrie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">He and Cramer, 1996</xref>) correlation between leaf area and ABA concentration, and further studies are needed to determine the physiological significance (if any) of such correlations.

That ethylene inhibits shoot growth of salinized plants was suggested by the improved growth of transgenic canola containing ACC deaminase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sergeeva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Although ACC levels were at the limit of detection of our analytical procedures, the fact that leaf and xylem ACC concentrations increased during the third week of salinization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) while growth was inhibited from the first week of salinization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), suggests that it was unlikely that ACC was responsible for the initial reduction in leaf growth and leaf appearance rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Root growth regulation</title><p>Since CKs promote shoot growth but inhibit root growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thomas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), low root CK content could stimulate or maintain root growth by prolonging the meristematic phase and thus increasing the number of cells before root elongation took place, as suggested for CKX-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibiting enhanced root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Werner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Indeed, the relative accumulation of CKs in the roots compared to the leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A, C</xref>) may be involved in the late root growth reduction under salinity, as these parameters were negatively correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8C</xref>). Interestingly, salinity actually increased root Z concentration from day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>), probably due to conversion from its conjugate ZR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3L</xref>), which should inhibit root growth rather than promote it. However, variable effects of CKs as a function of concentration and tissue specificity, suggests that a positive role of the increased root Z concentration on root growth cannot be ruled out. Indeed, exogenous CKs, especially the most active form Z, but also its derivatives such as ZR, stimulated tomato root growth (length and frequency) at very low concentrations (10<sup>&#x02212;11</sup> M) but inhibited growth at higher concentrations (Taylor and van Staden, 1998).</p><p>The interaction of CKs with other hormones such as auxins can also influence root biomass allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sachs, 2005</xref>). Although salinity (300 mM for an unknown period) decreased root IAA concentration in tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunlap and Binzel, 1996</xref>), salt-induced auxin accumulation in the roots increased the auxin/CK ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B, D</xref>), which may promote cell elongation and root growth. Since auxin is formed in developing and mature leaves and is necessary for the formation of lateral primordia in both root and shoot apical meristems (Kepinski, 2006), a link between acropetal and basipetal auxin transport has been suggested to co-ordinate shoot and root responses to environmental stimuli depending on the organ of detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casimiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sachs, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, IAA may act as a negative feed-back signal temporarily to repress CK synthesis in the roots and their xylem transport to the shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bangerth, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rahayu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), as seems to occur under salinity (this study).</p><p>Moreover, increased assimilate partitioning to the roots can be explained by changes in CWIN activity in both roots and leaves, as reported in CK-deficient tobacco plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Werner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This enzyme regulates sucrose transport by controlling the apoplastic unloading step from phloem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roitsch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). However, although CKs are major hormones establishing sink activity through the co-ordinated induction of extracellular invertases and hexose transporters in order to enhance phloem carbohydrate supply to actively growing tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roitsch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), this response seems to depend on the tissue, and Z is unlikely to be responsible for the CWIN induction in the roots. This idea is supported by the induction or maintenance of this enzyme activity reported in the roots of CKX-overexpressing tobacco plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Werner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) with lowered total CK and Z contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Werner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). However, IAA seems to induce both sink (sucrose allocation) and CWIN activities in both young leaves and roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roitsch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; A. Albacete <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished results), supporting its role in the relative increase in the root sink strength under salinity.</p><p>Similar to its action in the shoot, ABA accumulation may also be necessary to maintain the root growth of salinized plants. Although both WT and ABA-deficient (<italic>flacca</italic>) tomato plants showed a 50% reduction in root biomass at 200 mM NaCl, reciprocal grafting experiments showed that <italic>flacca</italic> scions with the same shoot biomass had a much greater root biomass with a WT rootstock than with a <italic>flacca</italic> rootstock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). As in the shoot, it is possible that root growth of these ABA-deficient rootstocks may have been inhibited by ethylene, since transgenic canola plants containing ACC deaminase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sergeeva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) had greater root growth, although this may be a consequence of improved shoot growth. While root ABA accumulation was apparently sufficient to limit root ACC concentration during the first two weeks of salinization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>), a late increase in root ACC concentration coincided with root growth inhibition. Whether this correlation is causative remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Long-distance transport</title><p>While local hormone concentrations can influence local growth processes in both roots and shoots, the extent to which a root-applied stress influences long-distance hormone signalling and thus shoot hormone status remains an ongoing research field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dodd, 2005</xref>). Although on some measurement occasions, for some hormones, concentration changes were significant in the roots but not the xylem, salinity only produced opposite changes in root and xylem hormone concentration for zeatin (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B, C</xref>) and root and shoot hormone concentrations for IAA (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). While this correspondence between root and xylem hormone concentrations might suggest that the former regulates the latter, the contributions of roots and shoots to xylem hormone concentrations can only be assessed by detailed flow modelling experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang and Hartung, 2008</xref>) and/or girdling to block phloem transport to the roots and thus hormone recycling via the xylem (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dodd, 2005</xref>).</p><p>While the roots are the first to perceive the osmotic component of saline stress, rapid loss of shoot turgor within minutes and hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Munns, 2002</xref>) could alter shoot hormone concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pierce and Raschke, 1980</xref>). However, root pressurization during salinity revealed that leaf ABA accumulation was independent of shoot turgor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kefu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>), but possibly induced by specific ions such as sodium, disproportionately to their osmotic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Montero <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Nutrient relations may also be involved in stress perception by the roots and CKs are considered long-distance signals mediating the shoot response to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> availability in the roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rahayu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Thus NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>/CI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> antagonism at the transport level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kafkafi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1982</xref>) may decrease root nitrate uptake and xylem loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cramer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), and long-distance CK transport to limit shoot growth under salinity. This idea is supported by observations that only the most tolerant tomato genotypes were able to maintain leaf nitrate concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">P&#x000e9;rez-Alfocea <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>), while deleterious effects of salinity can be alleviated by increasing NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> in the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grattan and Grieve, 1999</xref>). However, the contribution of xylem CK delivery to shoot CK status remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodd and Beveridge, 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> summarizes the different hormonal and growth changes induced by salinity in this study. Although much attention has been directed towards the role of the &#x02018;stress hormones&#x02019; ABA and ACC in growth regulation, these do not seem to be the primary factors controlling growth under salinity, at least during the early (osmotic) phases of salinity. Alternatively, cytokinins and auxins seem better candidates in explaining shoot growth impairment and changes in biomass partitioning. More direct evidence on the roles of these changes in hormone concentration are being sought from experiments involving genotypes differing in salt tolerance, tomato mutants, transgenic plants, and grafting procedures.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Fig. 9.</label><caption><p>Changes in hormonal concentrations in leaves, xylem sap, and roots in relation to local (shoot, leaf, and root growth) and co-ordinated processes (biomass partitioning) in tomato plants cultivated under salinity (100 mM NaCl) for 3 weeks.
