For example, several members of the nicotinic receptor family are modulated by physiological concentrations of extracellular calcium ions. In this paper, we examined conformational changes underlying this modulation and compare these with changes evoked by ACh. Two sets of residues in the &#x003b1;7 acetylcholine receptor extracellular domain were mutated to cysteine and analyzed by measuring the rates of modification by the thiol-specific reagent 2-aminoethylmethane thiosulfonate. Using Ba<sup>2+ </sup>as a surrogate for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we found a divalent-dependent decrease the modification rates of cysteine substitutions at M<sup>37 </sup>and M<sup>40</sup>, residues at which rates were also slowed by ACh. In contrast, Ba<sup>2+ </sup>had no significant effect at N<sup>52</sup>C, a residue where ACh increased the rate of modification. Thus divalent modulators cause some but not all of the conformational effects elicited by agonist. Cysteine substitution of either of two glutamates (E<sup>44 </sup>or E<sup>172</sup>), thought to participate in the divalent cation binding site, caused a loss of allosteric modulation, yet Ba<sup>2+ </sup>still had a significant effect on modification rates of these residues. In addition, the effect of Ba<sup>2+ </sup>at these residues did not appear to be due to direct occlusion. Our data demonstrate that modulation by divalent cations involves substantial conformational changes in the receptor extracellular domain. Our evidence also suggests the modulation occurs via a binding site distinct from one which includes either (or both) of the conserved glutamates at E<sup>44 </sup>or E<sup>172</sup>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Allosteric modulation of membrane receptors is increasingly recognized as a common mechanism used to control cellular signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In general, allosteric modulator binding causes changes in the response of the receptor to the "native ligand", presumably by altering the energetic barrier between resting and activated conformations. In most cases the modulator does not activate the target receptor in the absence of agonist. While there has been substantial progress in identifying the binding sites for many allosteric modulators (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]), the mechanisms by which modulators induce their effects remain poorly defined.</p><p>Some of the best examples of allosteric modulation involve members of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels that includes nicotinic AChRs as well as the GABA<sub>A</sub>, glycine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Cys-loop receptors transduce the energy of agonist binding into conformational changes that lead to channel opening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. All family members share a similar structure: they are transmembrane proteins assembled from five homologous or identical subunits. Each of these subunits is comprised of a large amino terminal extracellular domain (ECD), a large intracellular loop, and a four &#x003b1;-helix bundle forming a transmembrane domain (TMD). Recent studies aimed at identifying the structural basis for ligand gating have focused on the "transition zone" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] a region of the receptor at the boundary between the ECD the TMD. The transition zone includes structural elements thought to link the TMD and the ligand binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. While the evidence for this linkage is preliminary, a number of experimental approaches have unequivocally mapped the site for ligand binding to the interface of adjacent subunit ECDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. More recently, the crystal structures of ACh-binding proteins (AChBPs) from <italic>Lymnea</italic>, <italic>Aplysia</italic>, and <italic>Bulinus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] have provided a structural context for these biochemical and functional studies. The AChBPs are soluble proteins that act as ACh buffers in invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; they share both sequence and functional homology to the ECD of Cys-loop receptors. Earlier this year another structure, that of a homologous bacterial ligand-gated ion channel, was added to the structural database of Cys-loop receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These crystal structures have been used to develop and refine homology models of Cys-loop receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Our goal is to use these refined models to test specific mechanistic hypotheses that attempt to explain the dynamics of both ligand-induced receptor activation and allosteric modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Many neuronal nicotinic AChRs exhibit positive allosteric modulation by physiological concentrations of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In &#x003b1;7 nAChRs (but not other neuronal AChRs) Ba<sup>2+ </sup>or Sr<sup>2+ </sup>can elicit effects similar to Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This modulation consists of an increase in both the efficacy and the potency of ACh. The functional effects of divalents are similar to those caused by an emerging class of nicotinic modulating drugs collectively referred to as PAMs (positive allosteric modulators; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). Thus one rationale for a mechanistic characterization of divalent modulation of &#x003b1;7 AChRs is to serve as a model for studies of drugs such as PAMs developed to elicit a similar effect.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated that the modulation of &#x003b1;7 AChRs by divalent cations is independent of divalent cation permeation, suggesting that the binding site for modulation is extracellular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition several studies have demonstrated the importance of conserved ECD glutamate residues (E<sup>44 </sup>and E<sup>172 </sup>in chick &#x003b1;7) in divalent cation modulation, and it has been suggested that these may form the allosteric modulation binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that conformational changes evoked by divalent cation modulators of the &#x003b1;7 AChR are similar to those evoked by ACh. In addition, we examined whether E<sup>44 </sup>and E<sup>172 </sup>are required for divalent cation-evoked conformational changes. We found some similarities between Ba<sup>2+ </sup>evoked conformational changes and those caused by ACh. Surprisingly, we also found that the effects Ba<sup>2+ </sup>on modification rates did not require E<sup>44 </sup>or E<sup>172</sup>, suggesting that these residues do not form the divalent cation binding site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) is an established experimental approach to examine protein conformational dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We previously used this approach to scan regions of the chick &#x003b1;7 AChR and identified residues where the rates of thiol-specific modification by MTSEA were altered by ACh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We consider two alternative mechanisms for ACh-dependent effects on modification rates. If the substituted cysteine is at a position that is part of the agonist binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], then the effect of ACh could be due to steric occlusion. Alternatively, if the substituted cysteine is not near the binding site, then we infer that a change in modification rates is a result of conformational or electrostatic change induced by agonist-dependent activation. In this way, these residues serve as reporters of intramolecular changes during receptor activation.</p><p>SCAM can be used in the same way to identify conformational changes caused by allosteric modulators. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows a representation of the region of the &#x003b1;7 ECD targeted in this study. A discrete region of the inner &#x003b2; sheet, including M<sup>37</sup>, M<sup>40</sup>, and N<sup>52 </sup>was initially chosen to examine the effects of the divalent cation Ba<sup>2+ </sup>on MTSEA modification rates. We also examined the effects of Ba<sup>2+ </sup>at transition zone residues previously implicated in modulation by divalent cations, including E<sup>44</sup>, E<sup>172</sup>, as well as an adjacent position N<sup>170</sup>. All of the cysteine replacements at these residues have previously been shown to exhibit agonist-sensitive MTSEA modification rates, allowing us a basis for comparison for the effects of Ba<sup>2+</sup>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A model of the &#x003b1;7 AChR extracellular domain</bold>.

Wild-type &#x003b1;7 AChRs exhibit a complex positive modulation by divalent cations such as Ca<sup>2+ </sup>or Ba<sup>2+ </sup>that includes increases in both efficacy and potency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In contrast, receptors with the L<sup>247</sup>T phenotype typically exhibit a simplified modulatory response consisting only of a 5- to 10-fold left shift in the ACh dose-response.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> shows the effect of 10 mM Ba<sup>2+ </sup>on the &#x003b1;7 C<sup>115</sup>A/L<sup>247</sup>T receptor. There was a leftward shift in the dose-response curve corresponding to a ~10 fold decrease in EC<sub>50 </sub>(increase in potency). Of note, we do not see an effect of Ba<sup>2+ </sup>on efficacy in the parental background. We suspect this is due to the higher gating constant of receptors with the L<sup>247</sup>T mutation. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> shows that modulation by Ba<sup>2+ </sup>was eliminated in the E<sup>44</sup>C mutant, confirming that this conserved glutamate is required for Ba<sup>2+ </sup>binding or allosteric coupling of Ba<sup>2+ </sup>binding to ACh-dependent activation. This result is similar to the effect of an E<sup>44</sup>Q mutant described in wild-type and L<sup>247</sup>T &#x003b1;7 AChRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Several residues (M<sup>37</sup>C, M<sup>40</sup>C, and N<sup>52</sup>C) exhibited a change MTSEA reaction rates in the presence of ACh. We interpret differences in modification rates in the absence or presence of ACh to reflect differences in the apparent accessibility of the introduced cysteine between the unliganded and liganded states.

The effects are quantitatively similar to those measured in the presence of ACh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], consistent with the idea that Ba<sup>2+ </sup>causes conformational changes similar to those induced by agonist in this region of the &#x003b1;7 AChR. To more directly compare the effects of ACh and Ba<sup>2+ </sup>on reaction rates, we plot rate constants as ratios in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>. This figure highlights the differences in MTSEA rates under different conditions at these three positions. In contrast to M<sup>37</sup>C and M<sup>40</sup>C, we observed no significant effect of Ba<sup>2+ </sup>on MTSEA modification rate of N<sup>52</sup>C. This result parallels our previous study in which we found the effect of ACh on MTSEA modification rate of N<sup>52</sup>C was also different from that of neighboring residues M<sup>37</sup>C and M<sup>40</sup>C. Collectively, these results suggest that divalent cations such as Ba<sup>2+ </sup>act to promote some, but not all, of the conformational or electrostatic changes elicited by ACh. While ACh acts to stabilize the open state, Ba<sup>2+ </sup>acts to stabilize a state (or states) that are energetic intermediates between closed and open channels.</p><p>Modulation by divalent cations is known to require the conserved acidic residues at E<sup>44 </sup>and E<sup>172 </sup>(23, 24). We next tested whether Ba<sup>2+ </sup>could cause changes in the rates of MTSEA modification at E<sup>44</sup>C, N<sup>170</sup>C, and E<sup>172</sup>C. Similar to residues in the inner &#x003b2; sheet, each of these mutants has been shown to be a reporter of conformational or electrostatic changes induced by ACh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> shows mean values of second order rate constants measured in the presence of MTSEA alone, MTSEA plus ACh, and MTSEA plus Ba<sup>2+</sup>. At N<sup>170</sup>C, a mutant that showed allosteric modulation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), the rate of MTSEA modification in the presence of Ba<sup>2+ </sup>was the same as that measured in MTSEA alone, but was different from that measured in the presence of ACh. This observation suggests that conformational or electrostatic changes induced by modulators at this residue are distinct from those induced by ACh. Differences between the effects of ACh and Ba<sup>2+ </sup>were most pronounced at E<sup>44</sup>C; at this residue, the modification rate was ~10 fold higher in the presence of Ba<sup>2+ </sup>compared to that measured in the presence of ACh (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Surprisingly, despite the fact that both E<sup>44</sup>C and E<sup>172</sup>C show no positive allosteric modulation of ACh currents by Ba<sup>2+ </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), both exhibited significant Ba<sup>2+</sup>-dependent decreases in MTSEA modification rate.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Barium alters the rate of MTSEA modification at residues required for modulation by divalent cations</bold>.

From these and other studies, both residues were proposed to be participants in a binding site which mediates the divalent cation allosterism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The loss of Ba<sup>2+ </sup>dependent modulation in E<sup>44</sup>C or E<sup>172</sup>C mutations (also charge neutralization mutations) is consistent with this proposal, but the effects of Ba<sup>2+ </sup>on MTSEA modification rates are not. One possible explanation for these observations is that Cys replacements at E<sup>44 </sup>and E<sup>172 </sup>do not prevent Ba<sup>2+ </sup>binding, but cause an uncoupling of binding and allosteric modulation. If Ba<sup>2+ </sup>binds near E<sup>44</sup>C and E<sup>172</sup>C, the slowed modification rate at E<sup>44</sup>C or E<sup>172</sup>C would be explained by physical occlusion of the thiol side-chain by bound Ba<sup>2+</sup>. Alternatively, the glutamates could be a required component in the transduction pathway between Ba<sup>2+ </sup>binding and receptor modulation, but are not direct participants in the binding site. In this case divalent cations bind at a different site and elicit conformational or electrostatic changes (detected as changes in E<sup>44</sup>C and E<sup>172</sup>C modification rates), but binding does not lead to modulation. To test this possibility we examined MTSEA modification rates at M<sup>40</sup>C &#x003b1;7 AChRs in which a second, charge-neutralizing mutation (E<sup>172</sup>Q) was introduced. We reasoned that if E<sup>172 </sup>is required for binding of divalent cations, then the modification rate of M<sup>40</sup>C should be insensitive to Ba<sup>2+</sup>. If, however, Ba<sup>2+ </sup>binds to the receptor and causes conformational changes, despite the mutation at E<sup>172</sup>, this would be reflected by changes in the rate of modification of M<sup>40</sup>C.</p><p>We measured dose-response relationships for the M<sup>40</sup>C/E<sup>172</sup>Q double mutant in the absence and presence of 10 mM Ba<sup>2+ </sup>and confirmed that it was not positively modulated by Ba<sup>2+ </sup>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). When the rates of MTSEA modification of the M<sup>40</sup>C in this background were measured, we found that Ba<sup>2+ </sup>caused a significant slowing of MTSEA modification rate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The modification rates of M<sup>40</sup>C were independent of the E<sup>172 </sup>mutation. This result suggests that the binding site for Ba<sup>2+ </sup>modulation is somewhere other than a site which includes E<sup>44 </sup>and E<sup>172 </sup>in the &#x003b1;7 AChR transition zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Charge neutralization at E<sup>172 </sup>does not alter the rate of modification M<sup>40</sup>C by MTSEA</bold>.

In the nicotinic receptors, several different types of allosteric behavior have been described. The concerted, or MWC model, for example, refers to the allosteric effect of ligand binding on channel opening; this model suggested that binding of multiple agonists acted in concert to yield their "at a distance" effect. Experimental tests of the MWC model with combinations of agonists and antagonists suggest that a stepwise process more accurately describes the activation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Another type of allosterism seen in some nicotinic receptors is the positive allosteric modulation by divalents such as Ca<sup>2+ </sup>or Ba<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. For this type of allosterism, a fundamental question is whether the modulation alters the conformational "pathway" from closed to open states or simply modifies the kinetics of an agonist-dependent closed to open transition. Few studies have attempted to address this question, but a recent report does examine the conformational effects of positive allosteric modulators (benzodiazepines) in GABA<sub>A </sub>receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This study used SCAM to show that a prominent effect of benzodiazepines is to increase the access of GABA to its binding site, reducing the energetic barrier to the initial step in receptor activation, GABA association. Divalent cation effects on &#x003b1;7 AChRs provide a similar paradigm in which to examine the conformational changes evoked by allosteric modulators.</p><p>In an earlier report we described an &#x003b1;7 AChR mutant with a pair of cysteine substitutions positioned to introduce a disulfide bond in the outer &#x003b2; sheet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In our parental background this mutant was fully activated by divalent cations in the absence of ACh, but when expressed in an &#x003b1;7 AChR without the L<sup>247</sup>T mutation it required both ACh and divalent cations for channel activation. If we assume that activation of this mutant occurs as a result of Ba<sup>2+ </sup>interaction with the divalent cation allosteric site, then it suggests that Ba<sup>2+ </sup>and ACh promote two overlapping but distinct sets conformational changes. The experiments presented in this report provide further evidence that conformational effects of divalent cations are similar to those of elicited by ACh. Thus the simplest interpretation of our data is that divalent cations act by enhancing transitions in an ACh-dependent activation pathway without substantial effect on the final closed to open transition.</p><p>Le Novere and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] proposed a model for a divalent cation binding site that was based on earlier experiments, homology between the &#x003b1;7 AChR ECD and the <italic>Lymnea </italic>AChBP, and the known database of divalent cation binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The focus of this model was a cluster of 4 negatively charged residues in the transition zone: D<sup>41</sup>, D<sup>43</sup>, E<sup>44</sup>, and E<sup>172</sup>. Mutational analysis suggested that the glutamate residues were critical, since charge neutralization at either of the aspartate residues had only modest effects on divalent modulation. While the geometry of these residues in models of the ECD is consistent with their proposed model, our results with Ba<sup>2+</sup>-induced conformational changes are not. A mutation of either E<sup>44 </sup>or E<sup>172 </sup>to cysteine eliminates the modulation, but not the conformational changes associated with Ba<sup>2+</sup>modulation. This strongly suggests that the allosteric effects of Ba<sup>2+ </sup>are "transmitted" in a conformational pathway that requires these glutamates for some role other than divalent cation binding. It is unlikely that the Cys substitution is able to act as a functional substitute for Glu in a divalent cation site: a survey of all known Ca<sup>2+ </sup>binding sites found that Cys was never a contributor to a Ca<sup>2+ </sup>co-ordination site, while it often plays this role in Zn<sup>2+ </sup>binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Other possible candidates for a divalent cation modulation site in the &#x003b1;7 ECD include acidic residues in &#x003b2;6 and &#x003b2;8, which may combine with neighboring carbonyl groups to form a site for divalent cation binding. Alternatively, the recent work of Horn and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] has demonstrated that aromatic residues may provide the negative electrostatic environment required for formation of a physiologically relevant divalent cation binding site through the &#x003c0;-cation-type interactions. This is the same structural motif that has been shown to provide the negative electrostatic environment in the cholinergic agonist binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>MTSEA (2-aminoethylmethane thiosulfonate) was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada).

We mutated the lone unpaired cysteine in the extracellular domain (C<sup>115</sup>) to alanine to allow for a more straightforward interpretation of thiol modification experiments. We observed no functional effect of this mutation on receptor expression or ACh response. We included the mutation of leucine 247 in the M2 transmembrane domain (L<sup>247</sup>T; L9'T) because of its large current amplitudes and non-desensitizing kinetics compared to wild-type &#x003b1;7 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These receptors exhibit a higher "gating constant" than wild-type &#x003b1;7 AChRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], suggesting that the closed-to-open equilibrium of liganded C<sup>115</sup>A/L<sup>247</sup>T receptors favors the open state.
