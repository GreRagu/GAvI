Neovascularization of the disc (NVD)may occur in such chronic uveitis, however, it has not beenreported in SO to the best of our knowledge. Neovascularizationof the disc in this case was also of a recurrent nature.</p><sec sec-type=""><title>Case Report</title><p>A 25-year-old female patient presented with 2 months history ofgradual painless progressive diminution of vision accompaniedby floaters in the left eye. She had been treated with systemicand topical steroids with a presumptive diagnosis of panuveitis with disc edema at a primary health care center andwas referred. Her history revealed that 8 months earlier shehad undergone right eye parsplana lensectomy and vitrectomy(PPL + PPV) with intravitreal antibiotics at a different center,for suspected metastatic endophthalmitis secondary to postpartum abscess. Culture reports were, however, not available.There was no visual improvement following surgery and shehad developed phthisical changes.</p><p>On examination best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) wasno light perception in right eye while left eye had countingfingers (CF) close to face with accurate light projection. Inthe left eye apart from fine keratic precipitates, a 3+ cellularreaction was noted in both the anterior chamber (AC) andvitreous. Lens and intraocular pressure were normal. Fundusexamination showed the presence of hyperemic disc withblurred disc margins and tortuous dilated vessels [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1A">Fig. 1A</xref>]. Itwas associated with serous retinal detachment with shiftingfluid. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) showed multipletiny pinhead-sized hyperfluorescent spots in the superior halfof the retina [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1C">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1D">D</xref>] with an inferior serous retinaldetachment. Late phase showed disc hyperfluorescence withblurring of margins [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1B">Fig. 1B</xref>]. Systemic examination was normalwhich included hearing tests and dermatological examination.A clinical diagnosis of SO was made and intravenous pulsesteroids (Dexamethasone 100 mg in 150 ml of 5% dextrose)for three days along with topical steroids and cycloplegicswere started. Visual acuity improved to 13/200 on day four.Patient was continued on once daily oral steroids at 1 mg/kgbody weight. However, 2 weeks after therapy patient startedto develop side-effects to steroids and hence methotrexate15 mg/week and folic acid 5 mg were added while steroid dosewas reduced gradually by 10 mg/week.</p><p>Six weeks after starting methotrexate, cellular reactionreduced to 1+ in vitreous and no cells in AC with completeresolution of retinal detachment and the BCVA was 20/60.Patient was continued on these medications and was put on amonthly follow-up with close monitoring of the blood countsand liver function. After 14 weeks of starting methotrexate,patient was noted to have developed abnormal fine branchingvessels on the disc suggestive of neovascularization andthis was confirmed on the FFA [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2A">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2B">B</xref>]. Vitreousexamination revealed 1+ cell, however, there was no activity inthe AC. Patient was treated with pan retinal photocoagulation(PRP) and a posterior subtenon (PST) injection 0.5 ml of40 mg/ml triamcinalone acetonide while methotrexate wascontinued. Three months after the PRP, the vessels appearedto have regressed clinically as well as on FFA compared to theinitial presentation [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2C">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2D">D</xref>].</p><p>Two months later the patient presented with diminution ofvision. On examination her BCVA was 10/200, which rapidlydeteriorated to CF close to face in two days. There was noactivity in the anterior segment while there were 2+ cells in thevitreous. Fundus examination revealed recurrence of NVD andmultifocal serous detachments involving the macula, however,there was no peripheral serous detachment [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3A">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3B">B</xref>].The patient was given a repeat PST injection of triamcinaloneacetonide and the oral steroid was restarted at 1 mg/kg whilecontinuing with methotrexate. Ten days after starting thesteroids serous detachments resolved and the vision improvedto 20/200. Six weeks later the vision recovered to 20/60. Thesteroid dose was gradually tapered over a period of 12 weeksand maintained at 20 mg/ day with methotrexate reduced to7.5 mg/week.</p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Discussion</title><p>Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare sight-threatening bilateralpanuveitis with an incidence of 0.03/100000.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> In our case, SOoccurred after parsplana vitrectomy which is a rare occurrence.The reported incidence of SO following vitreoretinal surgeriesis 1 in 8001<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> and has shown an increasing trend, especially withrepeated surgeries. A corresponding risk following externalretinal detachment repair is 1 in 1357.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p><p>Kilmartin <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> in their study have noted that the currentSO risk following vitrectomy is more than twice that previouslyreported by Gass (0.06%).</p><p>Based on their study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> the same authors in a commentaryon SO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> have suggested that it would be appropriateto counsel patients regarding the risk of SO before thevitrectomy procedure. Pollack <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> in the largest case seriesof SO following vitrectomy without a previous trauma havenoted that SO following such surgical procedure may havediverse presentations and any atypical or persistent uveitisfollowing vitreous surgery should alert the treating surgeonof possible SO.</p><p>Another important manifestation in this case was NVD.Although occurrence of NVD is known in Behcet&#x02032;s disease,chronic uveitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> and Vogt Koyanagi Harada disease,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> ithas not been reported in SO to the best of our knowledge. NVD was ofrecurrent nature with the recurrence of inflammation.</p><p>In our patient the clinical setting of previous ocular surgeryand findings in the left eye were consistent with a diagnosisof SO. Early and prompt use of immunosuppressive therapywith systemic steroids and steroid-sparing agents such ascyclosporin A,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> azathioprine,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> chlorambucil haveimproved the prognosis in patients with SO. In our case we were ableto use methotrexate to successfully control the inflammationafter initial treatment with a combination of intravenous, oraland topical steroids.</p><p>After the initial control of inflammation the patientdeveloped NVD after 14 weeks of immunosuppressivetreatment. Considering that this was the only seeing eye ofthe patient and also the lack of a well-defined protocol fortreating such NVD in chronic uveitis, we decided to treat thepatient with PST injection of triamcinalone acetonide. A PRPwas also done considering the one-eyed status although therewas no ischemia on FFA. The combined therapeutic approachwas initially effective and resulted in regression of the NVDafter 12 weeks. However, the NVD recurred within 8 weeksand was associated with multifocal serous detachments andinflammation in the vitreous cavity. On restarting steroids withanother PST injection of triamcinalone acetonide the serousdetachments resolved within four days.</p><p>Although the initial occurrence of NVD was not associatedwith increased activity in vitreous its prompt response to steroids(systemic + PST) and its later recurrence with inflammation issuggestive of an inflammatory pathomechanism. The role ofPRP in this case is unclear, however, the recurrence of NVD withflare-up of inflammation suggests that PRP may not be usefulin this setting. We suggest that systemic immunosuppressionalong with repeated PST injection of triamcinalone acetonidemay be useful in treating such NVD in chronic uveitis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref
