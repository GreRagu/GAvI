Road traffic accidents, self-inflicted injuries and interpersonal violence are leading causes of death in age-groups &#x0003c; 30 years in high-income countries, and falls represent a major disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The same pattern of mortality is noted in small children (1&#x02013;4 years) with an increasing trend in high-income countries. In the United States (fiscal year 2003), there were 14,110 deaths from injury in children less than 18 years old reported to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. Of these, motor vehicle and traffic-related incidents were responsible for 63% of the deaths, followed distantly by homicide, suicide and drowning. The leading cause of nonfatal injuries was falls, and of the more than 8 million nonfatal injuries receiving medical attention, more than 151,000 required hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Patterns of injury and death for the general trauma population are important for trauma systems, resource and management planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, children and adolescents are recognized to have a particular set of injury patterns, severity, etiology and outcomes related to major trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. For one, they may participate in risk-taking behavior and activities that may be associated with major injuries, disability or even death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. While large epidemiological studies reflect regional or national trends and distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], data derived from various registries may have limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and may miss valuable details from individual assessments of fatal trauma in the young. Also, there are few studies including post-mortem examination in population-based trauma assessment overall, and particularly in the younger victims. This is likely reflecting a general reluctance to performing autopsy as it has raised controversy by its value for trauma care evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The aim of the current study was to investigate the death of children and adolescents after trauma in a defined population. In particular, we wanted to investigate mechanisms, severity, and location of injury, as well as gender differences, and temporal and seasonal distribution of fatal trauma in the young.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>This study is based in part on a previous study on all trauma deaths in our region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Aim of the current study was to investigate the deaths of children and adolescents resulting from major trauma forces and inflicted with severe anatomic injury. Thus, all traumatic deaths in victims aged &#x0003c; 18 years, and occurring in the Stavanger area during a 10-year period, beginning January 1<sup>st</sup>, 1996 and ending December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2005, and which underwent autopsy in our institution, were included. Patients were identified from a manual search of all autopsy records from this 10-year period. Excluded were drowning, hangings, poisonings, intoxications, and deaths exclusively caused by asphyxia with no anatomic injuries, and deaths from burn injuries.</p><p>Stavanger University Hospital (SUH) serves as the only primary trauma care facility for a mixed urban/rural population-based region of 290,000 inhabitants, and covers trauma for a wider population of approximately half a million. We have previously estimated a fatal trauma incidence of about 5&#x02013;6 per 100 000 per year in those aged &#x0003c; 19-years in this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The prehospital emergency medicine service (EMS) system is based on paramedic-manned ambulances, in addition to an anesthesiologist-manned rapid-response car and helicopter emergency system (HEMS). The SUH has a designated trauma team, which responds within 5 minutes of activation, and is present in the trauma resuscitation room in the emergency department when the patient arrives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Pediatric trauma is served by the general surgeon on-call, with pediatricians called in by priority, and intensive care initiated at a combined adult/pediatric surgical intensive care unit. Patients &#x0003c; 19 years of age-group represent about 20% of all trauma admissions, with the those aged 13 years or younger representing about half of the latter group (about 35 pediatric admissions/year fulfilling trauma registry criteria).</p></sec><sec><title>Autopsies</title><p>Autopsies were performed at the Stavanger University Hospital, Department of Pathology. Post-mortem examinations were conducted by protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Toxicology screens (blood and urine) were routinely performed in forensic autopsies. Postmortem radiological examinations were performed in select cases only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Pre- and inhospital trauma deaths within the Stavanger County jurisdiction have a high autopsy rate due to a general agreement between the Stavanger Police Department and the forensic pathologists at the hospital. Due to national legislation, all prehospital trauma deaths should normally undergo forensic examination. Thus, we believe the current material of consecutive autopsies performed over a decade to serve as a reliable representative from a population-based Norwegian region.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection and definitions</title><p>Demographic data, injury pattern and severity, and physiological signs were obtained from prehospital trip charts, clinical charts, and forensic and medical autopsy records, whenever available. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate (RR), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) were recorded on arrival in the emergency department, were applicable. To avoid missing values in physiological parameters, SBP, GCS, and RR were categorized on a five-point scale according to the Revised Trauma Score coded values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Conservative scoring was achieved by not underscoring physiological signs if exact data were missing (i.e., if intubated, the patients' GCS were scored from pre-intubation information, or as GCS = 8 [RTS-code 2] if intubated and no other information on eye, verbal or motor response were available).</p><p>Injury severity scoring was performed by a registrar (K.S.) trained and certified in the methods by AAAM using the Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS-90, 1998 update), Revised Trauma Score (RTS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), New Injury Severity Score (NISS), and calculation of probability of survival (P<sub>S</sub>) for in-hospital deaths using the TRISS methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Location of death was either prehospital or in-hospital.

The leading causes of childhood injury deaths are motor vehicle crashes, submersion injury, homicide, suicide, and fires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>This retrospective study of a consecutive autopsy series from a defined population in southwestern Norway shows fatal pediatric and adolescent trauma to consist of severely injured patients, with the majority of fatal injuries sustained to the head or to vital torso organs, with no, or only extremely poor, chances for survival for most victims. This is substantiated through the very high incidence of severe injuries, the location of these in the head/neck region, the number of very high ISS/NISS scores, and deranged physiology on arrival.</p><p>Limitations to the study, besides the retrospective design, is the exclusion of burns and other non-traumatic related causes of death (drowning, hanging, poisoning) which are often reported together with trauma-related deaths. However, we wanted to specifically focus on trauma-mechanisms resulting in anatomic injuries associated with a fatal outcome. Also, while this study was based on a very high autopsy rate in our region, some children with fatal trauma might have been missed when they became organ donors, as donors are often not undergoing additional autopsy (as the operative notes made after organ harvesting are usually regarded as a "partial autopsy report"). Thus, some children with isolated, severe head injuries may have missed the inclusion in this study. This would, however, have skewed the conclusion in an even stronger direction of our present finding of the head injury predominance.</p><p>As the numbers are small, statistical analysis should be interpreted cautiously, and statistics merely serve as an analytical adjunct to the clinical impressions in this study.</p><p>The role of head injuries is in line with other population-based investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The importance of road traffic accidents is in line with previous reports from other areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Obviously it emphasizes the importance of preventive measures in this age group, as the potential for interventional or life-saving procedures for these injuries appear futile, although initiated in an attempt to save lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The pattern of injury mechanism concurs with that reported by WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. As such, the road traffic safety appears crucial for reducing the number of deaths in the young. The extrapolated estimate of about 700 pediatric trauma admissions fulfilling trauma registry criteria during the study period gives an estimated death incidence of 5,1% overall, or about 2% for inhospital deaths, which is higher than that reported for rural pediatric trauma in the US, but equals national statistics for inhospital deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>According to Norwegian national statistics (fiscal year of 2004) there are more than 2,550 deaths caused by external trauma in Norway each year. About 150 (6%) are reported in those aged &#x0003c; 19 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Male deaths predominate (1.6 times) over that of female deaths, with the largest gender difference in those aged 15&#x02013;19 years (male: female-ratio of 2.7), and an near-equal distribution in those aged &#x02264;14 years (boys: girls ratio of 1.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The gender distribution is in accordance with the results obtained in this study.</p><p>However, in a previous report we showed that the age group &#x0003c; 19 years represent short of 20% of all trauma-related deaths within a defined population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], thus questioning the validity of the Norwegian national Cause of Death statistics as these are based, and rely, on the accurate reporting and coding practices among regions and hospitals. Autopsy practice may vary significantly among regions, and thus trauma-related deaths may be underreported. This should deserve further attention, and mandates the need of a national trauma registry, which is currently called for in Norway.</p><p>As injuries are not completely random events, factors associated with injuries allow identification of high-risk populations and targets for intervention. Injury research includes development of conceptual models to include pre-injury, event, and post-event features that can be modified to prevent or limit injuries. Successful prevention strategies often include multifaceted approaches such as education, incentives for safe human behavior, legislation/law enforcement, and environmental changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Preventive programs must weigh both societal and economic values and costs. Careful evaluation for effectiveness of injury prevention programs to decrease or limit injury continues to be a challenge. Focus on injury prevention for penetrating trauma (i.e. handguns and firearms) appears less important in Norwegian pediatric fatal trauma, compared to US reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Somewhat surprising was the high number of deaths occurring during summer/spring-time, outnumbering deaths during autumn and wintertime. In southwestern Norway, daylight is reduced during the latter period (October through April) with dusk typically setting in when children are walking home from school, which has led to safety programs issued in media and schools with focus on traffic safety for children. Less focus has been issued on the same safety issues during summertime, when daylight and dusk periods are extended (almost until midnight for some periods) &#x02013; however, more children may be active and out on the streets for a longer time during this time of year, and thus increasing the "time under exposure", i.e. for road traffic injuries. These observations are speculative at this stage, but should deserve further attention in future studies on causes and preventive strategies for pediatric trauma.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>(Ps): Probability of survival; (CNS): Central nervous system; (MOFS): Multiorgan failure syndrome"; (HEMS): helicopter emergency system; (SBP): Systolic blood pressure; (RR): respiratory rate; and (GCS): Glasgow Coma Scale; (RTS): Revised Trauma Score; (ISS): Injury Severity Score; (NISS): New Injury Severity Score.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KS conceived and designed the study.
