We investigated the presence of chemoattractants in the milk by analysing the chemoattractant activity of various fractions of this secretion. Milk chemoattractants are potentially involved in the recruitment of lymphocytes from the maternal bloodstream in lactating mammary glands.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The dilution-related lymphoid cell chemoattraction of whey was associated with a &#x0003c; 10 kDa ultrafiltrate. Active fractions were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Two peptides of 2.7 kDa (DMREANYKNSDKYFHARGNYDAA) and 1 kDa (RPPGLPDKY) were identified as fragments of the SAA protein family, tentatively identified as SAA2. Only the 2.7 kDa synthetic peptide displayed chemotactic activity, at two different optimal concentrations. At the lower concentration (3.7 nM), it attracted B-cell lymphoblasts, whereas at the higher (3.7 &#x003bc;M), it attracted B lymphocytes. Then, the SAA mRNA expression was analysed and we observed more SAA transcripts during lactation than gestation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data are consistent with the SAA<sub>23&#x02013;45 </sub>fragment being involved in preplasma B-cell recruitment to the mammary gland and resultant benefit to the neonate.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The mammary gland (MG) secretion is essential for the survival of neonatal mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This organ is a tertiary extralymphoid tissue with non-organised lymphoid components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Its vasculature and epithelium expand in size during gestation and lactation. In all mammalian species, this gland is colonised by T and B lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. T lymphocytes accumulate in the MG during gestation whereas B cells and their plasma cell derivatives progressively accumulate during lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Colostrum and milk immunoglobulins (Igs) are the net result of Ig extravasation from blood and local Ig production by plasma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These plasma cells are derived from remote tissue precursors which are induced either in systemic and in mucosal sites, depending on Ig isotype. In single-stomached animals, IgA is secreted by IgA plasmablasts, which originate in the gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] whereas IgG is derived from systemic sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown that the CC chemokine CCL28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] plays a major role in IgA plasma cell recruitment. Other factors may also be involved, particularly for other types of plasma cell. Indeed, unidentified factors in milk increase the migration of mouse IgG- and IgA-bearing mucosal lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For example, tumour necrosis factor isolated from milk has been shown to increase the migration of lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, other studies have reported that milk contains factors with cell regulatory and stimulatory properties. These factors include hormones and cytokines, which do not have specific effects on any given lymphocyte subset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We have shown that swine whey has chemoattractant activity (CA) for swine lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that whey was involved in the local recruitment of plasma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We tested this hypothesis by fractionating sow milk and assessing the ability of purified fractions to increase lymphocyte or B lymphoblast migration in relation to the stage of development of the healthy mammary gland.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Chemoattractant activity of whey ultrafiltrate</title><p>Previous investigations have shown that the removal of fat and casein did not result in the loss of the original CA of skimmed milk (data not shown). We show here that the &#x0003c; 10 kDa ultrafiltrate fraction (UF10) gave a bell-shaped dose-response curve typical of chemoattractants at the same optimal dilution (1/100), and with a similar number of migrating cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) to unfiltered whey. On the contrary, the &#x0003e; 10 kDa fraction was inactive (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Lymph node (LN) lymphocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and B lymphoblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) migrated to similar extents. Neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and monocytes (data not shown) purified from the swine blood do not exhibit any CA with fMLP and the &#x0003c; 10 kDa ultrafiltrate fraction. These results combined with morphological data demonstrate that CA activity is restricted to lymphoid cells. As CA was similar for lymphocytes from the mesenteric lymp node (MLN) and the ileal lymph node (ILN), we subsequently evaluated CA principally on B-cell lymphoblasts and MLN lymphocytes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Chemoattractant activity of whey with lymphoid cells, before (&#x025b2; &#x02013; &#x025b2;) and after 10 kDa PES membrane ultrafiltration (&#x025a0; &#x02013; &#x025a0;)</bold>.

Conversely, the extent of migration of the purified sIg+ B cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) towards the 2735 Da peptide was higher than that of spontaneous migration, at a concentration of 3.7 &#x003bc;M (p &#x0003c; 0.01), whereas the extent of migration of the sIg- fraction did not differ (p &#x0003e; 0.05) from that of spontaneous migration. No increase in migration towards the 1042 Da peptide was (p &#x0003e; 0.05) observed in either sIg+ B cells or sIg-depleted cells.

MG cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers (F0 and R0) designed into two relatively well conserved SAA regions. A single PCR product, corresponding to an internal fragment of the porcine SAA cDNA, was obtained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Its deduced amino-acid sequence carried the signature of all serum amyloid A proteins: ARGNYD(E)A-K(Q, R)RG-GG-WA.

As a single sequence was amplified by PCR, this "SAA2" is probably the most predominant member of the SAA family expressed in the MG. Production of the porcine SAA mRNA in MG was then assessed, using a second primer pair (F1 and R1) designed on the basis of our porcine SAA cDNA sequence. In porcine MG, SAA mRNA was detectable during gestation, and its level began to increase significantly at day 80 of gestation, reaching a peak at day 15 of lactation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

FPRL1 is a member of the FPR family that is expressed in human neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells as well as monocytes, whereas the N-formyl peptide receptor-like 2 (FPRL2) is expressed in human monocytes but not in neutrophils. When added to differentiated HL-60 cells or undifferentiated FPRL2-expressing HL-60 cells, the 2.7 kDa synthetic peptide (DMREANYKNSDKYFHARGNYDAA) was unable to induce intracellular calcium mobilization. In contrast, recombinant human ApoSAA, an agonist specific of FPRL1, or WKYMVm, an agonist of FPRL2, triggered a robust calcium response in differentiated HL-60 cells or undifferentiated FPRL2-expressing cells, respectively. This observation indicates that the absence of response with B cells could not be due to a lack of expression of FPRL1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>) or FPRL2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Calcium mobilization in myeloid cells expressing FPR, FPRL1 or FPRL2</bold>.

CA activity was not detected for neutrophils and monocytes, either onto filter or with purified blood cells. Amino-acid sequencing of the two peptides showed that they belonged to the SAA protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The partial sequence of the SAA cDNA amplified from the MG suggested that these peptides might be derived from SAA2, as the DNA sequence obtained was 98% identical to that of porcine SAA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, we cannot draw definitive conclusions concerning the SAA subtype corresponding to the 2.7 kDA chemoattractant peptide, as this peptide displayed a high degree of identity (&#x0003e; 90%) with SAA subtypes from different origins. Our data suggesting that SAA2 predominates in the MG, are reminiscent of the finding that bovine mammary-SAA or SAA3 differs from serum-AA in being present at extrahepatic sites, such as the gut epithelium, MG epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and in colostrum and milk in healthy animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, human breast was found to contain SAA1, SAA2 and SAA4, indicating that there is considerable variation amongst species, despite the sequence similarities. In swine SAA2, there is no deletion of the 8 aa (number 88 to 95) of the human sequence required for acute inflammation reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This observation provides further evidence that this peptide could play a physiological role in normal MG. The catabolic pathway of SAA has yet to be completely defined, but various studies have suggested that SAA is degraded by cell-associated elastase-like proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and several other serine proteases found in serum and milk, including kallikrein and plasmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The proteolysis of SAA by these enzymes leads to the generation of specific peptide fragments, some corresponding to amino acids 29 to 42 of SAA sequence, whereas the chemoattractant peptide is longer (23&#x02013;45) and has different cleavage sites. The specific action of the mammary SAA peptide on B lymphoid cells contrasts with the previously described activity of SAA. Indeed human SAA is described as involved in adhesion induction, migration, and tissue infiltration of T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The 2.7 kDa peptide (DMREANYKNSDKYFHARGNYDAA) is 92.3% identical to the 29&#x02013;42 peptide of hSAA-A (YIGSDKYFHARGNY) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], suggesting a similar function. However, only a few studies have used synthetic peptides: One study reported that hSAA<sub>29&#x02013;42 </sub>inhibited adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], whereas another found no inhibitory effect on neutrophil migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown that hSAA and the 29&#x02013;42 fragment display agonist activity involving FPRL1 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Moreover, fMLP receptor has not only been described on human neutrophils and NK cells but also on B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. As in our study, the fact that B cells respond to &#x003bc;molar concentrations suggest that they exhibit FPRL1 or FPRL2 receptors. However, we may exclude FPRL2 as this receptor does not bind or respond to N-formyl peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. On the other hand, swine L14 B cells incubated with human apoSAA or swine 2.7 kDa peptide failed to exhibit any calcium flux. These results indicate that the peptide probably uses a receptor other than FPRL1 and FPRL2. This receptor could be the recently described "receptor independent of FPRL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], which did not lead to a calcium influx. Furthermore, this receptor could be present in two similar forms: One of lower avidity on B cells and the other of higher avidity or subject to up-regulation after the activation of B cells or B lymphoblasts. Alternatively, these results could fit with the observation that B lymphocytes can respond without mobilization of intracellular calcium as observed, for example, with chemokines CCL19, CCL21, CXCL12 and CXCL13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The lack of CA of the terminal SAA peptide (RPPGLPDKY) with B cells does not entirely rule out activity with these cells. Indeed, the truncated form of hSAA, AGLPDKY (SAA<sub>98&#x02013;104</sub>), and analogues are known to bind human CD4+ T lymphocytes and to stimulate them to produce interferon-&#x003b3;. It is also possible that the 98&#x02013;104 peptide makes the cells susceptible to the 29&#x02013;42 fragment chemoattraction after activation.</p><p>Binding may also lead to the induction of cellular responses, such as cytokine secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and the up-regulation of integrin &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1, in particular. &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 expression increases the probability of <italic>in vivo </italic>binding to VCAM-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], a vascular addressin present on the MG blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].

This RGN motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] represents integrin-binding and cell attachment motifs derived from cellular adhesion protein molecules, such as fibronectin, collagen, vitronectin, fibrinogen, laminin and many microbial proteins, including the Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Binding of the RGN motif to the cell membrane is known to stimulate membrane integrins, leading to a local increase in the concentrations of F-actin and &#x003b1;-actinin, resulting in cell locomotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. It is possible that the peptide adheres to the filter via this RGN motif, inducing lymphocyte migration. Transposed <italic>in vivo</italic>, these data suggest a similar phenomenon, in which the binding of SAA to the surface of the mammary endothelial cells may induce B-cell adhesion followed by the transendothelial migration of these cells in an SAA-peptide gradient. Finally, in addition to binding to endothelial cells, SAA also binds to the basal membrane and extracellular matrix, probably due to its heparin-binding properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Thus, gradients of extracellular tissue-bound SAA or SAA peptides, including the 2.7 kDa peptide, may induce haptotactic B-cell migration in the mammary tissue during lactation.</p><p>SAA mRNA and protein productions have been recently demonstrated in extrahepatic tissues, and specifically in MG, mostly in epithelial and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], supporting the hypothesis of a role in lymphocyte recruitment.

In the last step of RP-HPLC purification, the F2B1 fraction was further fractionated to give F2B1- A, B, C and D.</p></sec><sec><title>Mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry analysis of chemoattractant factor</title><p>Mass spectrometry measurements were performed at the research support facility "Plant Biopolymers &#x02013; Interactions &#x02013; Structural Biology", INRA, at Nantes. Mass data analyses were conducted on a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF Global, Waters, Guyancourt, France) equipped with a nano-flow ESI interface.</p><p>For mass analyses, samples were dissolved in 8 &#x003bc;l of a water:acetonitrile:formic acid mixture (49.5:49.5:1, v/v). Approximately 1 &#x003bc;l of sample was introduced into a nano-ESI precoated borosilicate capillary (MDS Proteomics Inc., Odense, Denmark) and infused into the ion source at a flow rate of about 50 nl/min. MS and MS/MS measurements were carried out under the control of Mass Lynx software (Waters, Guyancourt, France).</p></sec><sec><title>Synthetic peptides</title><p>Two peptides were synthesized at Neosystem SA (Neosystem SA, Strasbourg, France), with the amino-acid sequences RPPGLPDKY (Mr 1041.56 Da) and DMREANYKNSDKYFHARGNYDAA (Mr 2735.21 Da). Purity exceeded 98%, as determined by high performance liquid chromatography (Neosystem SA, Strasbourg, France).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and DNase treatment</title><p>Samples of porcine MG tissue (0.1&#x02013;0.2 g) were collected into 1 ml Trizol (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) in polypropylene tubes and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After isopropanol precipitation, the RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol, dried and resuspended in 84 &#x003bc;l of ultrapure water containing 0.2% (w/vol) diethylpyrocarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin, France). Possible DNA contamination was eliminated by DNase treatment (Promega France, Charbonni&#x000e8;res, France) for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C, in a final volume of 100 &#x003bc;l containing: 4 U RQ1 RNase-free DNase, 40 U RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega France, Charbonni&#x000e8;res, France), 1 &#x000d7; RQ1 DNase buffer (Promega France, Charbonni&#x000e8;res, France). We added 1 &#x003bc;l Stop Solution and incubated the mixture at 65&#x000b0;C for 10 min. RNA was quantified by determining absorbance at 260 nm and purity was assessed by determining the A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>280 </sub>ratio.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcription</title><p>Reverse transcription was performed in an iCycler thermocycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), using 0.2 ml thin-walled tubes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). RNA (5 &#x003bc;g) was first incubated at 65&#x000b0;C for 10 min with 0.5 &#x003bc;g oligodT<sub>(12&#x02013;18) </sub>(Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France), and reverse transcription was then initiated by adding 5 U AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega France, Charbonni&#x000e8;res, France), 32 U RNasin (Promega France, Charbonni&#x000e8;res, France), 1 mM each dNTP (Promega France, Charbonni&#x000e8;res, France) and 1&#x000d7; AMV reverse transcriptase buffer, in a final volume of 40 &#x003bc;l. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 42&#x000b0;C and cDNA was stored at -20&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>PCR amplification of porcine SAA in mammary gland and densitometric quantification</title><p>We carried out a BLASTN search of the GenBank dbEST database. As no homologous porcine EST was identified based on the porcine SAA cDNA sequence, primers F0 et R0 were designed from dog, mink, guinea pig, rabbit and human SAA cDNA sequences, CM59173, in a region relatively well conserved between SAA of different subtypes and different animal origins, using VectorNTI software (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France). The forward degenerate primer was F0 (5'-TCAAGGGGCTTGGGACATG-3') and the reverse degenerate primer was R0 (5'-AGGGCAGAGCCAAGAGGAAG-3'), yielding a PCR product of 330 bp. PCR amplification was performed using the <italic>Pfu </italic>DNA polymerase (Promega France, Charbonni&#x000e8;res, France).</p><p>PCR was carried out for SAA cDNA amplification, in a total volume of 20 &#x003bc;l containing 100 ng of cDNA, 1 U Taq polymerase (Promega France, Charbonni&#x000e8;res, France), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.5 &#x003bc;M of each primers, 1&#x000d7; <italic>Taq </italic>polymerase buffer (Promega France, Charbonni&#x000e8;res, France), 2 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(Promega France, Charbonni&#x000e8;res, France). Sense F1 (5'- TCTGACATGAGAGAGGCCAACTAC-3') and anti-sense R1 (5'-GTCAGGCAGGCCACGAGGTCT-3') primers were designed on the basis of our porcine SAA cDNA sequence obtained from the F0-R0 PCR product. The porcine cyclophilin gene was used as a constitutively expressed 'housekeeping' gene control, to determine the uniformity of the reverse transcription reactions. Primers were used as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. The amplification conditions were carefully chosen to obtain signals in the linear range of amplification. Amplification products (10 &#x003bc;l) were loaded onto a 2% TBE agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide (0.01%), subjected to electrophoresis and visualised under a UV transilluminator. The fluorescence intensity of the bands was determined using the Alpha Imager Gel Analysis System Fluorchem version 2.00 (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA, USA). A single PCR product, of 270 bp for porcine SAA and 369 bp for cyclophilin, was obtained and analyzed by DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Culture and differentiation of HL-60 cells and stable expression of N-formyl peptide receptor-like 2 in undifferentiated HL-60 cells</title><p>Promyelocytic HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium/glutaMax I supplemented with 10% of heat inactivated foetal calf serum. The maximal density was maintained below 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml and, at each passage, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in an appropriate volume of complete medium in order to reach a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells per ml. To trigger the expression of both N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and N-formyl peptide receptor-like 1, HL-60 cells were differentiated to a neutrophil-like phenotype by adding <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>, <italic>O</italic>-2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5' cyclic monophosphate (Bt<sub>2</sub>cAMP) at the final concentration of 1 mM for 3 days.

Cells were supplemented with Fura 2-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) at a final concentration of 2 &#x003bc;M for 30 min, at 37&#x000b0;C. Cell suspensions were then diluted with two volumes of the same medium without BSA, washed once in 10 ml of Ringer-Krebs buffer, and suspended in RPMI medium without phenol red at a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>cells/ml. Calcium measurements were carried out with a SPEX FluoroMAX fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm (the ratio 340/380 is calculated when the signal is weak), an emission wavelength of 505 nm and slit widths of 5 and 10 nm, respectively. Intracellular free calcium concentrations were calculated using the following formula: (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)<sub>i </sub>= <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>(F-F<sub>min</sub>)/(F<sub>max</sub>-F) with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D </sub>for Fura-2 of 224 nM; F<sub>max </sub>is the fluorescence in the presence of 0.04% Triton X-100 and F<sub>min </sub>the fluorescence obtained after addition of 5 mM EGTA plus 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of results and statistical analysis</title><p>The results of migration assays are expressed in each experiment as the mean number of migrating lymphocytes &#x000b1; SEM of triplicates. Specific migration was calculated as the difference between the mean number of lymphocytes migrating in the presence of chemoattractant and the mean number migrating in the control medium (i.e. undergoing spontaneous migration). SAA mRNA levels are presented as the mean &#x000b1; SEM of the ratio of the band intensity of the SAA RT-PCR product over that of the corresponding cyclophilin RT-PCR product (Log SAA &#x02013; Log Cyclophilin). Means were compared by variance analysis and the Dunnett's <italic>t </italic>test or Student's <italic>t </italic>test. Differences were considered significant if p &#x0003c; 0.05. All statistical evaluations were carried out and graphs plotted with GraphPad Prism 4.03 (GraphPad software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CA: Chemoattractant Activity; MG: Mammary Gland; MLN: Mesenteric Lymph Node; ILN: Inguinal Lymph Node; FCM: Flow Cytometry Medium; fMLP: formyl-Methionyl-Leucyl-Phenylalanine; MS: Mass Spectrometry; MS/MS: Tandem Mass Spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BJR and CC participated in the study design, performed the experiments, and helped to draft the article.
