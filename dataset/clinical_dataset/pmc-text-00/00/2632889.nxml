The <italic>vls</italic> antigenic variation system, which expresses the surface-exposed lipoprotein VlsE, plays a major role in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> immune evasion. Gene conversion between <italic>vls</italic> silent cassettes and the <italic>vlsE</italic> expression site occurs at high frequency during mammalian infection, resulting in sequence variation in the VlsE product. In this study, we examined <italic>vlsE</italic> sequence variation in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> B31 during mouse infection by analyzing 1,399 clones isolated from bladder, heart, joint, ear, and skin tissues of mice infected for 4 to 365 days. The median number of codon changes increased progressively in C3H/HeN mice from 4 to 28 days post infection, and no clones retained the parental <italic>vlsE</italic> sequence at 28 days. In contrast, the decrease in the number of clones with the parental <italic>vlsE</italic> sequence and the increase in the number of sequence changes occurred more gradually in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Clones containing a stop codon were isolated, indicating that continuous expression of full-length VlsE is not required for survival <italic>in vivo</italic>; also, these clones continued to undergo <italic>vlsE</italic> recombination. Analysis of clones with apparent single recombination events indicated that recombinations into <italic>vlsE</italic> are nonselective with regard to the silent cassette utilized, as well as the length and location of the recombination event. Sequence changes as small as one base pair were common. Fifteen percent of recovered <italic>vlsE</italic> variants contained &#x0201c;template-independent&#x0201d; sequence changes, which clustered in the variable regions of <italic>vlsE</italic>. We hypothesize that the increased frequency and complexity of <italic>vlsE</italic> sequence changes observed in clones recovered from immunocompetent mice (as compared with SCID mice) is due to rapid clearance of relatively invariant clones by variable region-specific anti-VlsE antibody responses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Lyme borreliosis is the most common vector-transmitted infection in Europe and North America, and is caused by the spirochete <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> and other closely related <italic>Borrelia</italic> species. Lyme disease <italic>Borrelia</italic> have an elaborate mechanism for varying the sequence of VlsE, a surface-localized, immunogenic lipoprotein. This antigenic variation is thought to be important in immune evasion and thus in the ability of Lyme disease <italic>Borrelia</italic> to cause long-term infection. In this study, we examined 1,399 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> clones isolated from infected immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice to gain a better understanding of the rate and variety of VlsE sequence changes that occur during infection. We determined that clones with few or no VlsE sequence changes are rapidly cleared in mice with active immune responses, whereas clones with many VlsE changes persist. The <italic>vls</italic> antigenic variation system can utilize any of the 15 silent cassette sequences as sequence &#x0201c;donors,&#x0201d; and does not exhibit obvious preferences in the location of changes within the <italic>vlsE</italic> cassette region or the types of VlsE sequence variations found in different tissues, such as in joints or in the heart. Our findings provide further evidence that the <italic>vls</italic> locus represents a remarkably robust recombination system and immune evasion mechanism.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lyme borreliosis is caused by <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> and other members of the genus <italic>Borrelia</italic>, and is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-Steere1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In most cases, the sequence changes could be attributed to a particular silent cassette sequence or set of potential donor sequences. However, in many instances, the donor sequence could not be identified unequivocally due to the high degree of sequence redundancy among the silent cassettes. Tentative identifications of recombination events and the corresponding donor sequences were thus based on those sequence alignments that incorporated the longest stretch of sequence changes (minimal recombination event) flanked by regions that were shared between the parental <italic>vlsE</italic> and <italic>vls</italic> silent cassette sequences (constituting the maximal possible recombination event).</p><p>We developed a method for visual, semi-automated analysis of the recombination events using Visual Basic macros in an Excel spreadsheet. An example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000293-g004">Figs. 4A and 4B</xref>, in which the sequence of clone D10M8H8 (a variant isolated from a C3H/HeN mouse heart 10 days post infection) was aligned with the parental <italic>vlsE</italic> sequence and each of the silent cassette sequences. Each silent cassette (<italic>vls2</italic> through <italic>vls16</italic>) is represented sequentially by a different colored bar. Solid color regions represent individual codons that have undergone a sequence change and match the corresponding silent cassette in the aligned sequences. Hatched color regions are contiguous codons that match both the parental and silent cassette sequences in that part of the alignment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000293-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, silent cassette <italic>vls13</italic> (arrow) represents the most likely donor sequence due to the uninterrupted region of sequence identity spanning VR2 and VR3.

These &#x02018;template-independent&#x02019; changes encompassed a variety of genetic events ranging from single nucleotide changes, apparent illegitimate recombination events, triplet repeat expansions/contractions, or other insertions or deletions of up to 9 base pairs; they also tended to cluster in the variable regions <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000293.s005">(Figure S2</xref>). Certain codons had particularly high rates of template-independent sequence changes; for example, template-independent sequence changes of codons 73&#x02013;75 were identified in 19 variant sequences isolated from 10 different animals (11&#x00025; of template-independent clones). Similarly, sequence variants containing template-independent changes of codons 194&#x02013;199 were isolated 23 times from 13 different animals (14&#x00025; of template-independent clones). It is unclear whether these areas represent mutation &#x02018;hotspots&#x02019; or whether mutations arising in the variable regions are more likely to be maintained due to their location. The crystal structure of VlsE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-Eicken1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> reveals that the variable regions (VRs) form loop structures at the membrane distal surface of VlsE while the invariant regions (IRs) form structured alpha helical bundles. Mutations arising in the IRs might destabilize the proteins. Conversely, mutations in the VRs may aid the organism in antigenic variation and be maintained preferentially.</p><p>We did recover a large number of clones showing deletions or mutations in one IR region. Codons 10&#x02013;15 in IR1 contained deletions or template independent changes in 24 variants from 12 different animals (14&#x00025; of template-independent clones). Sequence changes in this region included a group of 7 variants (the last clones listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000293.s001">Table S1</xref>) in which related sequences differed at between 9 and 12 of 18 nt in the <italic>vlsE1</italic> sequence. These clones originated from skin and joint tissues of one mouse and the skin from another mouse 14 days post infection in the same experiment. These 18 nt sequences were not found elsewhere in the <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> B31 genome sequence, so their source is unknown. (They are not cloning artifacts, because the PCR products were sequenced directly without cloning.) The amino acid sequence in this segment of VlsE1 is LLDKLV, whereas the corresponding variant sequences are SAVRKE, SAVQQK, SAVRQE and SADQKE. This region of IR1 is part of the &#x003b1;3 alpha helix in the VlsE structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-Eicken1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Both clones contained identical sequence changes in the VR1 region that suggest a recombination event involving silent cassette 12 took place in a daughter of D10M10B3. However, D10M10B1 and D10M10B21 differ in VR6, consistent with these clones having undergone additional recombination events. Both clones contained sequence changes that are consistent with recombination with silent cassette 10 in VR6, but clone D10M10B21 exhibited additional changes in VR6 that suggest another recombination event with silent cassette 8 at some time following the recombination with <italic>vls10</italic>.

The higher number of recombination events identified at 214 days and 365 days post infection provides further evidence that recombination continues to occur throughout the course of infection.

In contrast to the results obtained with immunocompetent mice, the number of deduced recombination events did not increase significantly between day 4 and day 28 post infection in SCID mice.

In contrast, the lengths of the predicted maximum recombination events were more widely distributed between 7 to 419 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000293-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). (In this analysis, the maximal recombination event was based on the longest region of sequence identity if more than one silent cassette could have served as the &#x02018;donor&#x02019; for the recombination event.) These results indicate that the length of DNA that is utilized during the recombination process is highly variable, but tends to include a short region of nonhomologous DNA. The observed median minimal recombination (&#x000b1;S.E.) was 5&#x000b1;0.27 nt, whereas the median maximal recombination (&#x000b1;S.E.) was 89&#x000b1;0.37 nt. The difference between minimal and maximal recombinations reflects the high homology between the silent cassette sequences and the <italic>vlsE</italic> cassette region. Thus, each round of <italic>vlsE</italic> gene conversion (<italic>i.e.</italic> each <italic>vlsE</italic> recombination event) often introduces only one or two amino acid changes in each variant protein sequence, although a much larger region may be involved in each recombination event. To examine this mechanism further, the base changes occurring in 33 well-defined &#x02018;templated&#x02019; single nucleotide changes (proposed gene conversion events) were compared with 76 &#x02018;template-independent&#x02019; changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000293.s003">Table S3</xref>). While the proportion of nucleotide conversions were similar overall, C&#x02192;A transversions were favored in the templated group, and C&#x02192;G transversions were predominant in the template-independent group; this result implies that different mechanisms are operative in the two groups.

In each of these systems, a set of silent gene segments serves as the source of the &#x02018;donor&#x02019; sequence, but the donor site remains unaltered in progeny following the recombination. Also, the recombination events occur at a high rate within the target gene, indicating that special mechanisms facilitate unidirectional genetic change in the target site (but not the donor sites). Another unusual property shared by segmental gene conversion mechanisms is that the recombination is &#x02018;unanchored&#x02019; within the target gene, i.e. it does not start or stop at a certain sequence. The relapsing fever antigenic variation system is different in this aspect, in that most gene conversion recombination events occur at specific upstream and downstream homology sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-Dai1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data also indicated that very short recombinations occur in the <italic>vls</italic> system, and that long flanking regions of sequence identity between the donor and recipient sequences are not required. Indeed, in our analysis of probable single recombination events, there were examples where there was no sequence identity on one end or the other of the recombination (e.g. clones D7M3B12, D10M9H6, and D10M7J4). The day 7 joint isolate D7M2J05 (data not shown) exemplified clones with short segments of sequence identity at both ends of the recombination, with regions of identity of only 2 nt and 6 nt upstream and downstream of an 11 nt region of sequence replacement (from cassette 10). These results indicate that the <italic>vls</italic> recombination system requires very little sequence identity to initiate the recombination event. In this regard, the <italic>vls</italic> system appears to be similar to the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae pilE</italic> system, in which sequence changes ranging in size from as short as 1 nt to as long as 200 nt have been observed; in addition, over 50&#x00025; of the recombinations are 15 nt or less <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-Criss1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-Hagblom1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-Haas1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

We propose that a <italic>vls</italic> silent cassette sequence (in the form of lp28-1, a separate episomal DNA copy, or possibly even an RNA copy) undergoes strand invasion, displacing the parental strain. This process requires very short regions of sequence identity and could be facilitated by a DNA-binding protein or endonuclease to nick the recipient and/or donor DNA, although the lack of specificity in terms of the site of sequence change suggests that these activities would not be very site-specific. The strand invasion also appears to be terminated in a non-specific manner, in that the lengths of recombination were variable (although predominantly short). Termination may not require a region of sequence identity, in that there were examples where no region of sequence identity was found at one end of the <italic>vlsE</italic> sequence change.

Study of this phenomenon and its <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-acting mediators would be aided greatly by the identification of conditions that activate <italic>vlsE</italic> recombination in vitro, or <italic>vls</italic> shuttle constructs that undergo recombination in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and can be genetically manipulated to permit the identification of <italic>cis-</italic>acting elements.</p><p>Antigenic variation and phase variation in bacterial surface proteins are common and have been shown to contribute to avoidance of adaptive immune responses, to tissue tropism, or to the pathogenesis process (e.g. altered adherence properties). Our studies provide direct <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence of the function of gene conversion of the Borrelial VlsE lipoprotein. In wild-type mice (in comparison with SCID mice), clones having the parental <italic>vlsE</italic> sequence persist for a shorter period; in addition, <italic>vlsE</italic> codon changes and recombination events accumulate more rapidly. These data indicate that variants are selected in immunocompetent mice, most likely due to antibodies specific for the variable regions of VlsE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-McDowell1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar results have been observed in the Vlp/Vsp antigenic variation system of relapsing fever Borrelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-Alugupalli1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref> and the Vsa phase variation system in <italic>Mycoplasma pulmonis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-Denison1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The adaptive immune system thus acts as a selective force, killing clones with less variation but not eliminating clones with more extensive variation (and hence antigenic differences). In this study and as previously observed by Zhang and Norris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-Zhang4">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, the presence or absence of the adaptive immune system is not required to induce the <italic>vlsE</italic> gene conversion mechanism. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the adaptive immune system can directly affect the kinetics of the ongoing process of <italic>vlsE</italic> recombination, <italic>i.e.</italic> that the bacteria exhibit increased recombination under the influence of immune pressure (<italic>e.g.</italic> production of specific antibody or cytokines) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-Anguita1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, <italic>vlsE</italic> expression is increased under the influence of the immune pressure, specifically when functional B cells are present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-Liang1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. An interesting experiment would be to follow the rate of <italic>vlsE</italic> variant accumulation during the time course of infection of immunocompetent or SCID mice previously immunized with recombinant VlsE protein. An additional finding was that the production of a stable VlsE protein is not required for the <italic>vlsE</italic> gene conversion process to occur. Any silent cassette (and any region thereof) can be involved in a recombination event, and a variety of apparent template-independent genetic changes contributed to sequence variation. The recombination events are evenly distributed throughout the <italic>vlsE</italic> cassette region and exhibit no apparent bias for particular regions. Furthermore, no VlsE motif was associated with infection of a specific tissue site. The degree of variation observed indicates that the <italic>vlsE</italic> recombination system is one of the most robust antigenic variation systems found in pathogens.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Bacterial strains and cultures</title><p>The high-infectivity <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> B31 clones 5A3 (B31-5A3, lacking plasmids lp28-2 and lp56) and 5A4 (B31-5A4, containing all plasmids) were isolated previously from low-passage strain B31 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000293-Purser1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

The codon sequence for each individual observed difference was compared to the sequences present among the silent cassettes at the same position, thus determining the putative silent cassette source(s) of any non-parental codon found in a given variant sequence. By combining the location and the possible silent cassette sources for each change in a variant sequence, we were able to identify regions of sequence variation and to propose putative events of recombination as well as the silent cassettes potentially used as templates. For each region of sequence variation, the minimal deduced regions of recombination were defined as groups of contiguous codons differing from the parental sequence and matching a silent cassette sequence, whereas the maximal deduced regions of recombination included all contiguous codons in either direction in which the variant sequence matched both the parental and silent cassette sequences. The possible recombination events were thus determined computationally and portrayed graphically by the Excel&#x02122; spreadsheet, as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000293-g004">Figure 4</xref>.
