This is a difficult challenge because unbiased techniques to sample all possible target proteins and pathways are currently lacking. The observation that modifying the amount or activity of a gene product via mutation, overexpression, downregulation or deletion can change the response of a cell to a chemical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] raises hope that systematic genome-wide screens of drug sensitivity can help uncover direct and indirect drug targets as well as modifiers of cellular responses to chemicals.</p><p>The yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>is currently the eukaryotic model organism with the most comprehensive genome-wide collections of mutant strains available to monitor drug sensitivity. <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>exists as a haploid or as a diploid. Deleting 1 of the 2 copies of a gene in diploid strains can reduce its expression, and a set of ~6,000 heterozygous diploid strains covering nearly all essential and nonessential genes is available. Complete deletion of nonessential genes eliminates their expression and sets of ~4,900 haploid and homozygous diploid deletion mutants are also available. <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>can be easily transformed and increased gene expression can be achieved by introducing plasmids containing genomic DNA fragments or gene-coding regions controlled by inducible promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The unicellular nature of yeast and its ability to grow on liquid or solid media also make it amenable to high-throughput drug studies.</p><p>A number of studies have shown that reducing the copy number of essential or nonessential genes from 2 to 1 in diploid cells may increase the sensitivity of the cell to a drug (termed drug-induced haploinsufficiency) and can point to candidate target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Haploid or homozygous diploid deletion collections contain only deletions of nonessential genes. Screening these collections for hypersensitivity to a small molecule reveals genes that buffer the drug target pathway, not the direct drug targets and comparison of the profile of chemical-genetic synthetic lethality with a compendium of chemical-genetic or genetic interaction profiles can aid in deciphering its targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Increased gene expression can lead to suppression of drug sensitivity and also reveal target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Studies of the mechanism of action of drugs using genome-wide approaches in yeast have tended to focus on 1 of these 3 approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. While each generally reveals important clues, they draw only a partial picture of the mechanism of action of chemicals. For example, a drug-induced haploinsufficiency screen of the cancer cell invasion inhibitor dihydromotuporamine C (dhMotC) showed that the compound targets sphingolipid biosynthesis and affects the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], but did not reveal whether other cellular functions were affected and gave no indication of cell death mechanisms involved.</p><p>Genome-wide studies of drug mechanism of action have mainly concentrated on nuclear-encoded genes. Genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA, which include components of the mitochondrial translational machinery and 8 mitochondrial proteins, have not received as much attention. Yet mitochondria are recognized as important regulators of cell death in addition to their central role in energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although yeast displays only some of the characteristics of apoptosis described in humans, many cellular features of the cell death pathway in mammalian cells have been identified in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, it may also be important to examine the contribution of the mitochondrial genome to drug action.</p><p>Here we first examine the importance of the mitochondrial genome to drug sensitivity using <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sup>0 </sup><italic>petite </italic>strains deleted of mitochondrial DNA. We then examine the value to elucidating the mechanism of action of dhMotC of combining screening of <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sup>0 </sup>cells with 3 genome-wide screening approaches: drug-induced haploinsufficiency, chemical-genetic synthetic lethality and suppression of drug sensitivity by increased gene expression. We find that despite their similar conceptual basis, namely altering drug sensitivity by modifying gene dosage, the 3 approaches can provide distinct sets of information that, when integrated, reveal a much more complete picture of the spectrum of effects of a drug on cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Screen for mitochondria-dependent inhibitors of yeast growth</title><p>Halo assays, traditionally used in antibacterial screens, can be used to assess cytotoxic properties of chemicals in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Fungistatic and fungicidal chemicals spotted onto plates containing a lawn of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>growing in soft agar cause zones of growth inhibition (halos) that are easily detected by visual inspection. Robotic pinning enables high-density arraying of compounds for increased throughput.</p><p>We used the halo assay to screen approximately 3,500 FDA-approved drugs and bioactive chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] as well as in-house chemicals for inhibition of yeast growth. Chemicals were pin-transferred onto agar containing the wild type yeast strain BY4741 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or strain FY1679-28C/TDEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] with deletion of 2 transcription factors, <italic>PDR1 </italic>and <italic>PDR3</italic>, that regulate a wide range of multidrug resistance genes, to increase the likelihood of identifying active compounds. To determine the effect of functional mitochondria on drug sensitivity, the screen was also carried out on respiratory-deficient <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sup>0 </sup><italic>petite </italic>mutants of the 2 strains. The strains lacking functional mitochondria were generated by propagating cells in the presence of ethidium bromide, resulting in the selective loss of the mitochondrial genome, including several essential components of the electron-transport chain, which renders cells respiratory-deficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sup>0 </sup><italic>petite </italic>strains were unable to grow on glycerol, a nonfermentable carbon source, confirming their inability to generate ATP by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (data not shown).</p><p>Plates were inspected after 48 h incubation at 30&#x000b0;C and halos &#x0003e; 2 mm in diameter were scored. 51 chemicals inhibiting the growth of FY1679-28C/TDEC were identified (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), 39 of which also inhibited the growth of BY4741. Only 4 chemicals affected the growth of wild type and <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sup>0 </sup>cells differently.

This proton pump is a highly conserved multi-subunit enzyme complex that catalyzes the ATP-driven transport of protons from the cytoplasm to acidic organelles such as the vacuole and endosomes.

Its proton motive force is implicated in a variety of cellular processes such as protein sorting in the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways, proteolytic activation of zymogen precursors, storage of metabolic building blocks, Ca<sup>2+ </sup>homeostasis, and osmotic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In yeast, cellular pH can be assessed with the lysosomotropic amine quinacrine, a basic fluorescent compound that accumulates in acidified intracellular compartments such as the vacuole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

Binding of EGF to EGFR at the plasma membrane leads to dimerization of EGFR, stimulation of its tyrosine kinase activity and initiation of downstream signaling cascades.

Only 4 chemicals required functional mitochondria to inhibit yeast growth. Antimycin A inhibits the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to the cytochrome bc(1) complex. This inhibition is well known to cause the leakage of electrons to oxygen, resulting in the release of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Therefore, the inability of antimycin A to inhibit growth in <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sup>0 </sup>cells can be attributed to the lack of ROS production due to the absence of a respiratory chain. Unexpectedly, <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sup>0 </sup>cells were also resistant to 3 chemicals that target sphingosine and ceramide synthesis. Using dhMotC as an example, we showed that yeast cell killing requires holocytochrome c synthase activity. Moreover, forcing cells to rely exclusively on mitochondrial respiration to generate ATP by growth on a nonfermentable carbon source, rendered cells hypersensitive to dhMotC, highlighting the importance of a functional mitochondrial respiratory chain activity in its mechanism of action. These results indicate that sphingosine/ceramide biosynthesis is required to prevent mitochondria from becoming toxic to cells. In support of this conclusion, it has recently been shown that ceramide-depleted mitochondria were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and ethidium bromide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and that ceramide depletion in yeast mitochondria is associated with programmed cell death and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>A previous study from our laboratory explored drug-induced haploinsufficiency as a genome-wide approach to study the mechanism of action of drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This work identified sphingosine/ceramide biosynthesis as the vital pathway inhibited by dhMotC. Interestingly, none of the 21 heterozygous mutants showing increased sensitivity to dhMotC was deleted of a gene involved in mitochondrial function. Therefore, the drug-induced haploinsufficiency screen, despite its genome-wide coverage, only partially revealed the mechanism of action of dhMotC, concealing genes of mitochondrial function involved in the mechanism by which dhMotC kills cells.</p><p>A second screen carried out in the present study, to identify suppressors of drug sensitivity, clearly showed that increasing the expression of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins can substantially increase resistance to dhMotC, further strengthening the link between mitochondria and the mechanism of action of the compound. Interestingly, comparing the results from the drug-induced haploinsufficiency screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and the suppressor screen showed only 1 common gene, <italic>SUI2</italic>, a subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2 involved in amino acid starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This seemed surprising since the screens are conceptually similar in that they both rely on gene dose to identify drug-gene interactions. Differences between screens may be related to 1) stoichiometry, e.g. knockdown of 1 subunit of a protein complex is sufficient to reduce its activity and increase drug sensitivity while overexpression of 1 subunit of a protein complex is not sufficient to increase its activity and confer resistance, 2) redundancy, i.e. overexpression of a single gene is sufficient to confer resistance while knockout of redundant genes is necessary to detect sensitivity, and 3) unanticipated technical differences. Alternatively, the results may indicate a more complex relationship between gene dosage and drug sensitivity than has been generally considered.</p><p>The third screen carried out in this study was a chemical-genetic synthetic lethality screen to identify nonessential genes that increase sensitivity to dhMotC when completely deleted in haploid strains. 20 of the 53 genes identified have been implicated in resistance to multiple drugs in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and were therefore unlikely to provide clues about the specific mechanism of action of the compound. Standing out among the remaining genes are a number involved in the regulation of vacuolar pH, including 10 of 14 V-ATPase subunits and 2 membrane proteins required for V-ATPase assembly. This set of data strongly implicated vacuolar pH in the mechanism of action of dhMotC and led to the demonstration that dhMotC prevents vacuolar acidification. This effect is likely a consequence of inhibition of sphingosine/ceramide synthesis by dhMotC, since sphingolipids containing long-chain fatty acids are known to be necessary for V-ATPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Chemical-genetic synthetic lethality also revealed a large number of genes involved in vacuolar assembly and intracellular transport. Further experiments showed that dhMotC indeed inhibits the delivery of internalized FM4-64 to the vacuole as well as fluid phase endocytosis. This effect is also likely a downstream consequence of inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis since sphingolipids are important for protein trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and endocytosis is blocked upon interruption of <italic>de novo </italic>sphingolipid biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Defects in vacuolar acidification and endocytosis caused by dhMotC occur in <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sup>0 </sup>cells and are therefore independent of effects on mitochondria.</p><p>Interestingly, motuporamines also inhibited lysosome acidification and intracellular trafficking after endocytosis in cancer cells, demonstrating the capacity of this approach to predict targets in human cells. These results also provide insight into the mechanism by which dhMotC inhibits cancer cell invasion. EGF signaling plays an important role in cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].

By interfering with vesicle-mediated trafficking of EGFR, motuporamines considerably reduce plasma membrane-associated EGFR, and consequently its ability to control cancer cell migration.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates the value of using chemical genomics approaches in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>to understand the mechanism of action of biologically active chemicals that may have human therapeutic value. However, reliance on a single genome-wide approach may often provide an incomplete picture of the mechanism of action of drugs. Different chemical genomics screens can provide complementary information and their combined use is probably necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of the spectrum of different cellular effects a drug can have on cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, plasmids and growth conditions</title><p>The haploid set of viable yeast deletion mutants (mat_alpha_041902) was purchased from Invitrogen. The entire strain collection was used for the chemical-genetic synthetic lethality screen and individual strains (<italic>aif&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>mca1&#x00394;</italic>) were picked for drug sensitivity assays. Non-transformed yeast strains were grown in YPD (1% [wt/vol] yeast extract, 2% [wt/vol] bactopeptone and 2% [wt/vol] glucose), or YPgly (2% [vol/vol] glycerol) for media containing a nonfermentable carbon source.

After 24 h incubation at 30&#x000b0;C and shaking at 200 rpm, 10 &#x003bc;l of the culture were transferred to 1 ml fresh ethidium bromide-containing SCD medium. After another 24 h shaking at 30&#x000b0;C, 100 &#x003bc;l culture was plated on YPD agar plates and incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02013;3 days.

After autoclaving and cooling to 65&#x000b0;C, 50 ml of filter-sterilized 20% glucose solution was added. 45 ml of medium were dispensed in Omnitray plates and left to set. A solution of YPD with 0.5% agar was prepared the same way by adding 2.5 g agar. For each plate screened, 23 ml YPD 0.5% agar were inoculated at 50&#x02013;55&#x000b0;C with 500 &#x003bc;l of an overnight yeast culture (FY1679-28C/TDEC, BY4741 or <italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sup>0 </sup>mutants of the same strains) and 22 ml of the mixture were poured in the Omnitray plates on top of the set YPD 2% agar and left to set for 1 h.</p><p>Compounds were pin-transferred from 5 mM DMSO stocks in 96-well plates into the cooled agar with a pin-tool robot (BG600, BioRobotics) using 0.7 mm dia. pins that deliver 0.34 &#x003bc;l each. Before and between applications pins were cleaned by submersion in 10% bleach and 70% ethanol for 5 s each followed by drying for 10 s with warm sterile air. The plates were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 48 h and halos were verified by visual inspection.</p></sec><sec><title>Growth inhibition measurement in liquid culture</title><p>Yeast strains (OD<sub>600 </sub>= 0.02) were incubated with appropriate dilutions of each compound in 200 &#x003bc;l cultures in 96-well plates, in addition to DMSO controls. Kinetic growth curves were generated with a TECAN plate reader by reading the OD every 2 h after agitating the plate prior to reading to suspend the yeast. For growth comparisons between different treatments the exponential part of the growth curve was considered and ODs were transformed into log<sub>10 </sub>values. The least squares method was applied to generate a straight line that best fit the data and line slopes were calculated to compare growth behaviour between different growth conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Drug dosage suppressor screen</title><p>Multicopy pool construction and growth &#x02013; A <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>random genomic library (gift from Martha Cyert) constructed in a high-copy 2 micron expression vector (YEplac195) with an average insert size of approximately 5 kb was transformed into yeast (BY4743) by a standard lithium acetate method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and selected in -URA dropout medium. After 3 days incubation at 30&#x000b0;C, ~106 transformants were pooled into medium containing 7% DMSO, aliquoted, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. For screens, frozen aliquots were thawed and inoculated directly into 700 &#x003bc;l -URA dropout medium to an OD<sub>600 </sub>= 0.02. Compound was added and the pool was grown for 5 generations in 48-well microtiter plates (Nunc). Final compound concentrations were as follows: 50 &#x003bc;M for dhMotC, analogue 20 and 27, 6 &#x003bc;M for analogue 21. An inhibitory concentration of at least 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) was necessary to provide sufficient selection when screens were performed for 5 generations. Cells were harvested automatically by a Packard Multiprobe II four-probe liquid-handling system (PerkinElmer). Plasmid isolation, insert PCR amplification and microarray hybridization &#x02013; Plasmids were isolated using the Zymoprep II plasmid isolation kit (Zymo Research). The inserts were amplified by PCR with the FailSafe&#x02122; PCR System (Epicentre<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Biotechnologies) using common M13 primers. PCR cycling conditions were: an initial melting step at 95&#x000b0;C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 0.5 min, 58&#x000b0;C for 0.5 min and 68&#x000b0;C for 10 min followed by a final extension at 68&#x000b0;C for 15 min. The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and labelled with biotin using the BioPrime labelling kit (Invitrogen). Labelled products were hybridized to Affymetrix TAG4 arrays using the same protocols as described for TAG hybridizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Multicopy suppression profiling (MSP) analysis &#x02013; ORF probe intensities were extracted and normalized. Log2 ratios of probes for drug-treated versus DMSO control were calculated. Each ORF was represented by at least 2 probes and the log2 ratios were averaged to generate a single score for each gene. To identify each suppressor locus, the log2 ratios of intensities were ordered by each ORF's genomic location and analyzed using a sliding window to identify loci that had at least 2 adjacent ORFs with log2 ratios &#x02265; 1.6.</p></sec><sec><title>Quinacrine assay</title><p>Wild type yeast (BY4741) was grown overnight in YPD buffered with 50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>at pH 7.6.

To terminate the assay, 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing 10 mM NaF and 10 mM NaN<sub>3 </sub>was added. For visualization, yeast cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 &#x003bc;l potassium phosphate buffer. For the Lucifer yellow assay yeast cells were grown to OD<sub>600 </sub>= 0.1. After harvesting by centrifugation the pellet of yeast cells was resuspended in 90 &#x003bc;l YPD medium and 10 &#x003bc;l of 40 mg/ml Lucifer yellow stock was added to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml. DhMotC was added immediately to a final concentration of 60 &#x003bc;M. The mixture was incubated at 30&#x000b0;C with shaking at 200 rpm for 1 1/2 h. To stop the assay, 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing 10 mM NaF and 10 mM NaN<sub>3 </sub>was added. Cells were harvested and washed 3 &#x000d7; with 1 ml ice-cold potassium buffer. After the last wash, cells were resuspended in 20 &#x003bc;l buffer for visualization. A Zeiss microscope (Axiovert S100) equipped with filters for epifluorescence and phase contrast was used. Cells stained with quinacrine or Lucifer yellow were observed by exciting with 420&#x02013;490 nm light and viewing emitted light with a 520&#x02013;550 nm filter. Cells stained with FM4-64 were observed by exciting with 520&#x02013;550 nm light and viewing emitted light with a 610 nm cut-off filter. Photographs were taken with a QImaging Microimager II camera. Data were collected as pictures of random fields and each field was photographed both with phase contrast optics and epifluorescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Cancer cell assays</title><p>MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin.
