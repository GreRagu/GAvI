Implementation has been difficult, given the paucity of high-volume centers and the logistical hardships facing patients. Some studies have shown that low-volume hospitals achieve good outcomes as well, suggesting that other factors are involved. We sought to determine whether variations in annual volume affected patient outcomes in 511 patients who underwent pancreatic resections at the University of California, San Francisco between 1990 and 2005. We compared postoperative mortality and complication rates between low, medium, or high volume years, designated by the number of resections performed, adjusting for patient characteristics. Postoperative mortality rates did not differ between high volume years and medium/low volume years. As annual hospital volume of pancreatic resections may not predict outcome, identification of actual predictive factors may allow low-volume centers to achieve excellent outcomes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="section" id="sec1"><title>1. INTRODUCTION</title><p>The desire to improve surgicaloutcomes has resulted in significant interest in volume-outcome relationships. As insurance companies continue developing policies that may use hospitalvolume to influence patient choice of treatment center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the importance of the issueincreases. For pancreatic resectionsspecifically, many studies have found that higher annual volume predicts lowermortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Such findings have led someto advocate regionalization of pancreatic resections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Despite this call, however,there have been practical limitations to such centralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, the validity ofstudies that typically rely on administrative databases for information hasbeen questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A recent study from ourinstitution suggested that the observed benefits at high-volume hospitals maybe &#x0201c;exported&#x0201d; to low-volume hospitals, suggesting that factors other thanvolume alone may contribute to outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Few studies havefocused on the effects of annual fluctuations in hospital volume on outcome for pancreatic resections. Additionally, most studies group differenttypes of pancreatic resections together instead of distinguishing betweenpancreatic head resections and non-head resections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, many studies have examined the relationshipbetween annual volume and mortality but have not addressed whether volume affects postoperativecomplication rates. We sought todetermine whether the reported volume-outcome relationships would be observedover time at a single institution for both mortality and postoperativecomplications, and whether those relationships would hold true for specifictypes of pancreatic resections. We alsolooked at trends in pancreatic resections performed at our institution over 16years to determine which factors were associated with postoperativecomplications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="subsec2.1"><title>2.1. Patient selection</title><p>The paper and electroniccharts of 511 patients who underwent pancreatic resection at UCSF's Moffitt Hospital  between January 1990 andOctober 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were identified through a computerized search for proceduralcodes from the <italic>InternationalClassification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)</italic> corresponding to the following diagnoses: partial pancreatectomy, proximalpancreatectomy, distal pancreatectomy, radical subtotal pancreatectomy, otherpartial pancreatectomy, and pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). We excluded patients who were identified bythe computerized search but did not in fact undergo actual pancreatic resection(e.g., those who had pancreaticojejunostomy, pancreatic debridement, orpancreas transplant). We also excludedpatients who were younger than 16 years of age at the time of resection. Race/ethnicity was collected as recorded onthe patients' records. The University of California, San Francisco Committee onHuman Research approved this study prior to the review of patient records.</p></sec><sec id="subsec2.2"><title>2.2. Demographic and clinical characteristics</title><p>The followingdata were recorded for each patient: age, gender, ethnicity, ASA score,indication for operation, operation type, pathologic diagnosis, postoperativecomplications, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.</p><p>Operation typesincluded PD, pylorus-preserving PD, distal pancreatectomy, spleen-sparingdistal pancreatectomy, subtotal pancreatectomy, total pancreatectomy, and totalpancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation.</p><p>Pathologicdiagnoses were grouped into pancreatic adenocarcinoma, periampullary tumor,cystic tumor, neuroendocrine tumor, chronic pancreatitis, gastrointestinalstromal tumor, metastatic tumors, or &#x0201c;other.&#x0201d;Periampullary tumors included neoplasms of the common bile duct, ampullaof Vater, and duodenum. Cystic tumorsincluded intraductal papillary mucinous tumors, mucinous cystadenoma, mucinouscystadenocarcinoma, microcystic adenoma, serous cystadenoma, and solid andpapillary neoplasms. All other findingswere categorized as &#x0201c;other.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="subsec2.3"><title>2.3. Outcomes</title><p>Postoperativecomplications were assessed by clinical diagnosis noted in the medical record,and included wound infection, pancreatic fistula/leak, gastroparesis, bileleak, reoperation, bleeding, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). Less frequent complications were groupedtogether as &#x0201c;other,&#x0201d; a category that included pleural effusion, pulmonaryedema, pulmonary embolus, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, wound dehiscence, <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> colitis, acuterenal failure, incisional hernia, and bacteremia.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of annual volume on outcomes, each study year was listed by number of resections performed. To maximize differences between the lowvolume and high volume groups, the years were then divided by volume into threeroughly equally sized groups: high, medium, and low. To furtherdetermine whether the volume of a specific type of pancreatic resection couldpredict outcomes, years were categorized in two ways: based on volume of pancreatic head resectionsperformed, and by the volume of non-head resections performed.</p></sec><sec id="subsec2.4"><title>2.4. Statistical analysis</title><p>We used multiple logisticregression to examine all relationships between annual volume and outcome,adjusting for patient gender, presence of underlying malignancy on pathologicaldiagnosis, race (white or nonwhite), and age.

RESULTS</title><sec id="subsec3.1"><title>3.1. Patient characteristics</title><p>Of the 511patients who underwent pancreatic resections during the 16-year study period,52% were females.The average age was 58.6 &#x000b1; 14.7 years. Most patients (61%) areself-identified as White.</p></sec><sec id="subsec3.2"><title>3.2. Procedures</title><p>Themajority (60%) of resections performed were pancreatic head resections (PD);non-head resections (40%) comprised distal, subtotal, or totalpancreatectomies. Among the pancreatichead resections, more than (60%) were pylorus-preserving PD as opposedto classical PD.</p><p>Among the non-head resections, 85%were distal pancreatectomies.</p></sec><sec id="subsec3.3"><title>3.3. Pathologic diagnoses</title><p>The most common pathologic diagnosis wasadenocarcinoma of the pancreas (25%), followed by periampullary tumorsand cystic tumors. Three of the 33 patients with a preoperative diagnosis ofchronic pancreatitis had final pathologic results that indicated malignancy. Conversely, 15 (24%) of the 62 patients with a final diagnosis of chronicpancreatitis were erroneously believed to have a malignancypreoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="subsec3.4"><title>3.4. Comparison of complication rates for head andnon-head pancreatic resections</title><p>Rates of woundinfections, intraabdominal abscesses, pancreatic fistulas, gastroparesis,reoperations, and &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; complications were significantly higher in patientswho underwent pancreatic head resections than in those who underwent non-headresections. Not surprisingly, patients who underwent pancreatic headresections also had significantly longer hospital stays (mean of 14.9days versus 10.7 days). Length of stayranged from 2&#x02013;373 days with amedian of 11 days for pancreatic head resections, and 1&#x02013;56 days with amedian of 8 days for non-head resections. Additionally, slightly more surgical complications occurred in patientswith an underlying malignancy (34.4%) than in patients with benign disease(25.3%).</p></sec><sec id="subsec3.5"><title>3.5. Effect of annual volume on resection outcome</title><p>An average of 32  &#x000b1;  17 pancreatic resections were done annually during theyears included in this study. A higherthan average number of resections (<italic>n</italic> = 262) was performed between 1998&#x02013;2002, but the numbersdeclined beginning in 2003, possibly related to the departure of one particularsurgeon. With some exceptions, trends inthe volume of non-head pancreatic resections generally followed those of headresections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, becausethe volume of head resections did not necessarily increase or decreaseconcordantly with the volume of non-head resections, we first used the rates ofpancreatic <italic>head</italic> resections to definehigh, medium, and low volume years, and then used the rates of <italic>non-head</italic> resections to do so (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>We found that among patients whounderwent any pancreatic resection in low volume years as defined by number of head resections performed,there were no in-hospital deaths. Whenmedium and low volume years werecombined for purposes ofstatistical analysis, there was no difference in death rates for eitherpancreatic head resections (odds ratio  =  1.62, <italic>P</italic>  =  .64) or non-headresections (odds ratio  =  1.09, <italic>P</italic>  =  .9) between high volume years and low/medium volume years. Inaddition, there were no significant differences in postoperative complicationrates among patients undergoing non-head resection in high versus low volumeyears. The incidence of gastroparesis(odds ratio  =  0.57, <italic>P</italic>  =  .7) and bleeding (odds ratio  =  0.344, <italic>P</italic>  =  .398) was lower in high volume years, but not significantly so, and theincidence of UTIs was higher, but again, not significantly so (odds ratio  =  4.26, pq  =  0.199) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). The onlydifference was that there were significantly fewer bile leaks in patients whounderwent pancreatic head resection in a high-volume head resection year (oddsratio  =  0.09, <italic>P</italic>  &#x0003c;  .05) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>When the rates of pancreatic non-headresections were used to define high, medium, and low volume years, there was nosignificant difference in death rates for either pancreatic head resections(odds ratio  =  1.13, <italic>P</italic>  =  .923) or non-head resections (odds ratio =0.652, <italic>P</italic>  =  .611) performed in high volume years versus low volumeyears. The same was true forcomplication rates (odds ratios  =  0.734 for non-head resections, and 0.798 forhead resections). Although for patientsundergoing non-head resections, the incidence of gastroparesis in high volumeyears was lower, the difference was not significant (odds ratio  =  0.338, <italic>P</italic>  =  .453), nor was the higher incidence of intraabdominal abscesses (odds ratio =1.92, <italic>P</italic>  =  .554). Similarly,patients undergoing head resections had fewer wound infections, bile leaks,cases of pneumonia, and less bleeding in high volume years, but again, thedifferences were not significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec4"><title>4. DISCUSSION</title><p>Ourfindings show that at a single institution variation in annual pancreaticresection volume does not affect mortality. In fact, there were no in-hospital deaths following pancreatic headresection during the six low volume years included in the study. Although ourhospital's volumes may be considered high by some criteria, during four of thesix low volume years, we did not meet the Leapfrog consortium's cutoff forbeing an index center (11 pancreatic head resections per year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], suggesting that our lowvolume group is truly reflective of low volumes based on nationally acceptedstandards. The results presented hereare discordant with the previously demonstrated inverse relationship betweenpancreatic resection volume and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In fact, the findings seem to suggest that &#x0201c;once a high-volume hospital,always a high-volume hospital,&#x0201d; even if fluctuations in volume actually givethat hospital low-volume status for a given period of time. If this is the case, there must be somefactor that affords the hospital the ability to maintain excellent mortalityrates independent of volume. Theexistence of such a factor supports the notion that the systems in placeat a particular institution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] may be the effectors ofoutcome, and suggests that a higher volume may be a proxy for the presence ofthese systems. This may explain why somelow-volume hospitals have been able to achieve low mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and why it may be possibleto &#x0201c;export&#x0201d; good outcomes to low-volume hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Manystudies support the idea that volume is only one part of a complex system offactors that affect outcomes, with findings such as race [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], the proportion of minorities treated at agiven hospital, surgeon volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and even surgeon age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] playing roles in surgical mortality. An advantage of the grouping method used inour study is that each group contains a diverse range of years (e.g., the low volumegroup contains years 1990 and 2005), possibly reducing the contribution fromany one surgeon.</p><p>Although sometrends toward fewer complications in high volume years were observed, only theincidence of bile leaks following pancreatic head resection was significantlylower in the high volume years. We havenot seen this specific finding in published reports, but a recent study didshow decreased complication rates following pancreatic resection as volumeincreased in an already high-volume hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Some have suggested thatdifferences in the quality of managing postoperative complications may accountfor differences in-hospital outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; however, in the prior study,and the one reported here,mortality rates remained unchanged despite changing trends in complicationrates. Additionally, during the periodof time included in the study, there was no system-wide initiation of apreoperative or postoperative pathway for patients undergoing pancreaticresection.</p><p>It is possiblethat although we had high and low volume years, we failed to find a differencein mortality rates because we divided pancreatic resections into head andnon-head resections when creating our volume groups. Had we instead used all pancreatic resectionsto define the groups, our low volume years may have exceeded the volumedesignated as &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; in other studies. However, because many studies have grouped different types of pancreaticresections together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and to be consistent with alarge study which showed a volume-outcome relationship for pancreatic headresections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], we chose to split them up inorder to see whether there was any specific predictive value for a givenresection type. Additionally, we stillhad a clear difference in the average number of resections performed in highversus low volume years.</p><p>Inour analysis of other factors that may contribute to morbidity and mortality,our results were mostly consistent with previously reported data, with patientsundergoing pancreatic head resection experiencing more complications than thoseundergoing non-head resection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In our series, 31.4% of patients had one ormore surgical complications following pancreatic head resection, consistentwith the reported overall morbidity of 30&#x02013;55% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In our study, the incidence of pancreaticfistula after pancreatic head resection was 10.5% and consistent with priorreports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], while the incidencefollowing other pancreatic resections was 3.9%. Our findings suggest that the creation of the pancreatic anastomosiscarries a higher risk of pancreatic leak than transection of the pancreas. Interestingly, others have reported a higherincidence of pancreatic fistulas with left-sided pancreatic resections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Forpatients with malignant disease, the overall surgical complication rate was34.4% compared to 25.3% for patients with benign disease. Although patients withmalignant disease tended to have more complications, only the incidence ofgastroparesis came close to differing significantly. This is fairly consistent with other studieswhich have shown no differences in surgical complications between these twopatient groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The higher observed incidence of gastroparesismay be due to the higher incidence of gastroparesis reported with malignancyitself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Ourstudy has many important limitations. First, it was retrospective. A prospective study would have allowedmore accurate assessment of postoperative complications, since we had relied on physiciandiagnosis and notation of complications in the medical record. As such, definitions of particular diagnoseswere likely inconsistent across physicians and the time course of the study. Additionally, review of inpatient charts indicated in-hospital mortality, butwe were not able to accurately assess deaths that may have occurred afterdischarge, limiting the inclusion of potential deaths due to latecomplications. Moreover, although weincluded over 500 patients in this study, the study is still limited to asingle hospital's experience.</p><p>Clearly,many studies have observed lower mortality rates for pancreatic resections performed at high-volume hospitals. Understanding the precise mechanism behindthis association may allow us to improve outcomes for patients facing diseasesthat require pancreatic resection. Thefact that this relationship is not borne out at a single hospital that had fluctuations in volume overtime, that race has been shown to affect outcome for some procedures irrespectiveof hospital volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], that clinical studies areless likely to find volume-outcome relationships than administrative studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and that patientcharacteristics at high and low volume hospitals differ significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], all points to a much more complex explanation than volume alone. Of course, these data give no insight intohow hospitals acquire the ability to provide good outcomes after pancreaticresections. Surgical volume may indeedplay a role; however, annual volume alone does not appear to be an adequatepredictor of postoperative mortality at our institution. Even if the answer were simply volume, we saw that implementingregionalization faces considerable obstacles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The goal then is to determine how to improveoutcomes for patients who will continue to be treated at low-volume hospitals. Our findings suggest that excellent outcomesfor pancreatic resections are possible despite changes in volume. Further investigation is needed into whatelements make that possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec5"><title>5. CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Annualvolume of pancreatic resections does not predict postoperative mortality at amajor academic medical center. With theexception of a lower incidence of bile leaks following pancreatic headresections performed in high volume years, there are no differences inpostoperative complications following pancreatic resections in high versus lowvolume years. These findings contradictpreviously published studies and suggest the need for further investigationinto the predictors of outcomes following pancreatic resections.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Pamela Derish in the Department of Surgery at UCSF for editorial review, Michael Schell and Anthony Barcia, formerly in the Department of Surgery at UCSF, for chart review.
