Rel1- and Rel2-dependent transcription in <italic>A. gambiae</italic> has been shown to be particularly critical to the mosquito's ability to manage infection with the rodent malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>. Using RNA interference to deplete the negative regulators of these pathways, we found that Rel2 controls resistance of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> to the human malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, whereas Rel 1 activation reduced infection levels. The universal relevance of this defense system across <italic>Anopheles</italic> species was established by showing that <italic>caspar</italic> silencing also prevents the development of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in the major malaria vectors of Asia and South America, <italic>A. stephensi</italic> and <italic>A. albimanus</italic>, respectively. Parallel studies suggest that while Imd pathway activation is most effective against <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the Toll pathway is most efficient against <italic>P. berghei</italic>, highlighting a significant discrepancy between the human pathogen and its rodent model. High throughput gene expression analyses identified a plethora of genes regulated by the activation of the two Rel factors and revealed that the Toll pathway played a more diverse role in mosquito biology than the Imd pathway, which was more immunity-specific. Further analyses of key anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> factors suggest they may be responsible for the Imd pathway&#x02013;mediated resistance phenotype. Additionally, we found that the fitness cost caused by Rel2 activation through <italic>caspar</italic> gene silencing was undetectable in sugar-fed, blood-fed, and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected female <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, while activation of the Toll pathway's Rel1 had a major impact. This study describes for the first time a single gene that influences an immune mechanism that is able to abort development of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in <italic>Anopheline</italic> species. Further, this study addresses aspects of the molecular, evolutionary, and physiological consequences of the observed phenotype. These findings have implications for malaria control since broad-spectrum immune activation in diverse anopheline species offers a viable and strategic approach to develop novel malaria control methods worldwide.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The relationship between malaria parasites and the mosquitoes that transmit them to humans comprises complex molecular interactions including mosquito immune responses. <italic>Anopheles</italic> can mount potent anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> immune responses; we show here that the gene <italic>caspar</italic>, which encodes a negative regulator of the immune signaling pathway Imd, controls mosquito resistance to the human malaria parasite. Silencing of this Imd pathway regulator results in complete resistance to human <italic>Plasmodium</italic> in three divergent Anopheline malaria vector species, yet does not cause complete resistance to a rodent <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, indicating conservation of defense function among mosquito but not diverse parasite species. We also identify a panel of genes that are transcriptionally regulated by silencing of the <italic>caspar</italic> gene. Some of these genes contribute directly to parasite resistance. Finally, we show that the transient immune activation that renders mosquitoes resistant to the human malaria parasite has little to no effect on mosquito fitness as a measure of survival or fecundity under laboratory conditions. In sum, this study shows that the mosquito's immune pathway, Imd, can regulate resistance to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> through immune responses that entail several known anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> genes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The innate immune system of the African malaria vector, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, is the mosquito's main line of defense against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites and is engaged at multiple stages of parasite infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Meister1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Michel1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Considering that only the long form, Rel2-F, has inhibitory domains that need to be cleaved for activation, Caspar may only be regulating one branch of Rel2-dependent transcription. Rel2-F has also been shown to be involved in regulating transcription of key Imd pathway marker genes and melanization, and in reducing the number of <italic>P. berghei</italic> parasites in the midgut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Meister2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Luna1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>; however, because our dsRNAs target common domains of both Rel2 forms, we cannot rule out the possibility that Caspar may also be somehow regulating Rel2-S in the mosquito.</p><p>The mosquito's immune response against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is currently under scrutiny as a target for malaria control strategies yet there is much to learn about how immune responses are mounted against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and what the physiological implications are or how the responses are conserved.</p><p>Our data first indicate that manipulation of the mosquito's immune system can produce a near-complete loss of the vector's ability to transmit an unusually virulent strain of the human malaria parasite. Note that we used a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain that produces exceptionally high infection levels when compared to naturally acquired <italic>Plasmodium</italic> in the field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Pringle1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This exceptionally virulent strain failed to develop in 85&#x00025; of the Caspar-depleted mosquitoes, and even those mosquitoes that became infected showed a 94&#x00025; loss of oocysts when compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000335-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Caspar-depleted <italic>A. gambiae</italic> are therefore likely to be completely refractory to natural parasites in the field.</p><p>Second, we establish that the reduction in oocysts resulting from depletion of either Cactus or Caspar indicates that both the Toll and Imd immune pathways are involved in the defense against both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. berghei</italic>, but to different degrees depending on the parasite species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000335-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). This and other studies have shown that activation of the Toll pathway through <italic>cactus</italic> silencing renders mosquitoes almost non-permissive to infection with the rodent malaria-causing parasite <italic>P. berghei</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Frolet1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, while our data indicate that the same treatment results in an increased but only partial resistance to infection with the human <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Previous studies have also shown profound differences in the immune responses mounted by <italic>A. gambiae</italic> to <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Dong1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Cohuet1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data further support the existence of a distinction between immunity-based resistance to rodent and human malaria parasites and this distinction appears to depend, at least in part, on which Rel factor is activated; i.e. Rel2-based immunity seems most efficient against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> while Rel1-based immunity is most efficient against <italic>P. berghei</italic>. It will be interesting to identify the underlying cause of this distinction; experiments that identify mosquito proteins specifically regulated by either parasite coupled with experiments identifying unique parasite surface molecules may help clarify the distinction.</p><p>Third, we observe that the infection-resistant phenotype is not constrained by <italic>Anopheles</italic> species; silencing <italic>A. albimanus</italic> and <italic>A. stephensi caspar</italic> orthologs reproduces the reduction in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> oocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000335-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>). This, in light of the relative divergence of these mosquito species, brings about important insight into both the evolution of the <italic>Anopheles</italic>-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> interaction as well as the implications for the development of malaria control strategies based on mosquito immunity. Co-evolution is at the crux of the complex interactions between vector, parasite and host. How is it that some interactions can be consistent from one species to another while others are unique? What pressures are exerted by the environment or microbial exposures that precipitate changes or, alternatively, what needs are only met through conservation? Caspar's proposed role in the Imd pathway obviously marks a position in the immune system that is needed by mosquitoes to combat <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and, as a negative regulator of a powerful pathway, may be involved in maintaining the evolutionary balance between controlling the parasite and avoiding chronic immune up-regulation. But how, then, does Caspar depletion circumvent species-specificity? At the cellular and molecular level, the possible differences between species in the <italic>Anopheles</italic> genera are indefinite, meaning slight alterations in any number of molecules, cells or mechanisms could be responsible for variable success of an anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> response. We think it is likely that Caspar depletion transcends this limitation because we have targeted a conserved protein in a conserved pathway that leads to the activation of a battery of anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> mechanisms. It is certainly possible that some constituents of these downstream mechanisms differ from mosquito species to species but the sum of all parts is a robust overall anti-<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> immune response. This same principle would mean that it is unlikely that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> would acquire resistance to this strategy since there are multiple effectors working in concert. From a malaria control aspect, in this way we can gain refractoriness in a variety of vectors.</p><p>Fourth, we have begun to delve deeper into the molecular outcome of <italic>caspar</italic> silencing. Dissection of the downstream battery of immune effectors and how/if they interact is a formidable task and would require extensive experimentation and collaborative efforts. However, using transcriptional and functional genomics, we do establish here that such a mechanism exists and that several key anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> genes are involved. The microarray-derived gene expression profiles illustrate that silencing negative regulators activates an arsenal of genes, immune-relevant and otherwise, that may or may not have a direct effect on malaria parasites. Depletion of Cactus resulted in the transcriptional regulation of a more than five-fold higher number of genes than did Caspar depletion, suggesting that Rel1 is a more ubiquitous transcription factor than Rel2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000335-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). In fact, the Toll pathway has been linked with a variety of processes in development and hemocyte proliferation, and this range of effects was reflected by the broad range of functional gene groups that we found to be influenced by <italic>cactus</italic> silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000335-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Belvin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Qiu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Pal1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar observations have also been made in Dif/Dorsal-deficient <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae and other Toll pathway factor mutants that have shown differences in the expression of a large number of non-immune genes, whereas mutations in Imd factors have affected immune gene expression more specifically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Pal1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, the Toll pathway appears to be a more general and versatile signaling pathway, while Imd is more immunity-specific. Many genes that responded to Cactus depletion are involved in replication, transcription and translation&#x02014;a likely consequence of the cellular response needed to accommodate the increased activation of a potent transcription factor such as Rel1 and the hemocyte proliferation known to follow Toll pathway activation. Immunity, redox/stress responses and metabolism were also well-represented; immunity and redox reflect Rel1's major role in the response to pathogens and the stress caused by infection while the concurrent enrichment of metabolism- and apoptosis-related genes may provide a transcriptional link between the immune response and recovery from infection.</p><p>Although <italic>caspar</italic> silencing influenced transcription of significantly fewer genes, a considerable proportion of regulated genes belonged to the immunity class (see further discussion on individual genes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000335.s002">Text S1</xref>). Within this class were genes encoding quite a few known or putative anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> effectors that are good candidates for mediating the molecular outcome of <italic>caspar</italic> silencing that results in parasite killing. Some of these candidates, such as FBN9, TEP1 and LRRD7 (APL2), have already been described as performing anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> roles and we have shown here that they display a temporally regulated transcription profile when <italic>caspar</italic> is silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000335-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Dong1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Blandin1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Riehle1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. We focused on these 3 genes because of their relevance to the infection phenotype addressed in this study. Using co-silencing techniques, we found that depletion of Caspar cannot confer resistance to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> when FBN9, TEP1 or LRRD7 was co-depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000335-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These double-silenced mosquitoes harbored similar numbers of oocysts as mosquitoes depleted of the effector alone. Intriguingly, double silenced mosquitoes tended to carry fewer oocysts than the singly silenced which further our theory that a battery of anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> genes, and not just one or two effectors, is regulated by Caspar. This was further illustrated by cocktail silencing experiments in which Caspar, along with two or more effectors were depleted. These triple gene-silenced mosquitoes showed a slightly greater (though not additive) infection intensities compared to those with just <italic>caspar</italic> and a single effector silenced, suggesting a concerted effort occurring either downstream or in parallel to Caspar. That the Imd pathway could control regulation of a fibrinogen-domain-containing molecule and a complement-like molecule that together interact to combat invading parasites is not unlikely. In vertebrates, ficolins are the fibrinogen-like domain containing pattern recognition receptors that activate the lectin complement pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Liu1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Matsushita1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Evidence of lectin pathway components in chordates and jawless vertebrates suggests that it is the most ancient complement activation pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Matsushita2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Endo1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. The precedence set in the vertebrate system for these two molecules to cooperate to destroy pathogens as well as the observation that both TEP1 and FBN9 co-localize to the parasite surface justify speculation that a lectin complement pathway&#x02013;like mechanism may also exist in mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Blandin1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and Dimopoulos lab, submitted).</p><p>Finally, to investigate the potential fitness impact of this highly potent anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> defense, we performed several proof-of-principle assays to determine if longevity or fecundity could be influenced by the RNAi-mediated transient immune response activation. We concede that this is by no means a thorough study of how Imd and Toll activation pathway activation impact fitness, but it provides baseline indications on any obvious physiological consequences of this immune boosting. The fact that <italic>caspar</italic>-silenced, but not <italic>cactus</italic>-silenced, mosquitoes lived as long as controls indicates that the products of the Imd, but not the Toll, pathway have a negligible effect on longevity under these conditions. Since our gene expression data indicated that <italic>cactus</italic> silencing influences five times more genes than does <italic>caspar</italic> silencing, it may be that the Toll pathway's transcriptional output is more costly than that of the more immune-specific Imd pathway. This difference could also reflect a greater toxicity of Toll products in the host. Reduced fecundity could also impart a reduction in fitness yet we observed that the same number of viable offspring were produced per <italic>caspar</italic>-silenced female as <italic>dsGFP</italic>-treated or non-injected controls; taken with the longevity data, we conclude that fitness by these measures and in this environment is unimpaired by the transient Rel2 &#x02013;mediated immune response. The contrasting fitness cost of <italic>cactus</italic>-silencing suggests that manipulation of the Toll pathway may be too detrimental to mosquito fitness for its use in a malaria control strategy, though it would be quite interesting to continue investigating how Toll pathway activation impacts fitness and how insects negotiate the cost/benefit of Toll pathway activity. On the other hand, that Caspar manipulation does not confer a noticeable fitness cost warrants future evaluation in more realistic contexts and further analysis of its molecular mechanism. We do suspect that fitness costs will be less obvious in this context than in others, since the immune induction here was not sustained for a lifetime but was relatively temporary because of the kinetics of the RNAi process. This situation is in accordance with reports showing that sustained NF-kappaB-dependent chronic immune responses are correlated with a shorter life while temporary acute responses are not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Libert1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. We also questioned whether this analysis could have become compromised by the experimental method that required injection of dsRNA which also could facilitate introduction of bacteria that could alter survivorship; the <italic>caspar</italic> dsRNA treated mosquitoes may in this case experience an advantage due to immune activation We must use this technique as gene silencing and over expression by other methods are prohibitively difficult in <italic>A. gambiae</italic>. As a control, hemolymph from mosquitoes injected with dsRNA against <italic>caspar</italic> and GFP as well as unwounded mosquitoes was perfused with saline and plated on LB agar at sterile conditions. Resulting colony counts indicated that individual mosquitoes from all groups contained a large range of bacterial quantities and no significant differences were found among groups suggesting that if bacteria are introduced into the hemocoel during injection, they are in negligible amounts or are unable to survive and/or proliferate (data not shown).</p><p>Upon <italic>caspar</italic> silencing, we did not observe any spontaneous melanization that was the compelling phenotype for the discovery of Caspar deficiency in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000335-Kim1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. It is likely that the absence of melanization in mosquitoes simply reflects differences in how deficiencies are generated; a P-element insertion in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can cause Caspar loss of function throughout the body for a lifetime while the RNAi-mediated silencing strategy we employed is transient and causes differing levels of transcript degradation in different tissues. Because of this, we can not rule out that a constitutive and thorough Caspar loss of function would cause a similar hyper-melanization phenotype in mosquitoes.</p><p>By manipulating Caspar and Cactus in the present study, we were able to produce a transcriptional immune response that potentially involved a variety of anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> factors. Thus, <italic>caspar</italic> silencing was probably so effective against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> because it simultaneously enhanced an entire battery of relevant effectors and mechanisms. Global induction is advantageous for development of control strategies, since it avoids reliance on a single gene and the associated limitations in effectiveness: that it may only be effective against a certain parasite stage or strain and that resistance may more easily develop. This may also be why, as a physiological and biochemical mechanism, immune system activation produces a more extensive reduction in parasite burden than synthetic methods. If our strategy of depleting Caspar proves to be an effective way of limiting vector competence, short-term immune induction could be achieved through infection-inducible promoters that drive recombinant Rel2 expression. A further understanding of the impact of immune pathway activation on the mosquito's fitness will necessitate not only the development of an injury-independent mechanism but also the assessment of fitness under field conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Identification of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> Caspar</title><p>Peptide sequences for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Caspar (CG8400) and its predicted <italic>A. gambiae</italic> ortholog were retrieved from Ensembl and subject to alignment using BLAST and Clustal W and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix.
