By taking advantage of whole-genome sequence assemblies with a high level of coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], one can seek to provide exhaustive and genome-scale level predictions regarding functional sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The general approach relies on the exploitation of sequence similarities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] phylogenetic data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], evolutionary models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and evidence regarding conservation of gene order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These often complementary comparative approaches have been developed to estimate and improve the identification of functional sequences for both newly sequenced species as well as reference species, such as human and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, multispecies genome scale comparisons allow to refine protein-coding genes annotation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] as well as better understanding of the timing and the frequency of duplication events for lineage-specific genes called in-paralogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Fine-scale comparative maps constructed using robust orthologous sequences are key for allowing identification, visualization and characterization of conserved segments as well as collinearity of gene order between the species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Gene order between species is not random and this has been shown to correlate with, for example, co-expressed and co-regulated genes suggesting a functional significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Otherwise, gene order conservation between species could also be exploited to identify relocated protein-coding genes in non-syntenic chromosomal regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], as well as potentially retrotransposed genes given that the latter correspond mostly to pseudogenes inserted in non-syntenic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Consequently, as part of the characterization of architecture of a genome, analysis of gene order conservation between species can be a strong indicator for both gene prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and identification of gene loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we have analyzed the sequence assembly of the domestic dog for which the annotation process identified less protein-coding genes than expected compared to predictions from the primates and rodent genomes. We focused on a set of 412 genes that are all annotated in four closely related mammals; human, chimpanzee, mouse and rat, but absent in the dog genome in the most recent assembly of the dog (CanFam 2.0). We exploited the property of gene adjacency conservation between related species to target in-depth sequence alignments over a short genomic interval. In addition, our approach includes a functionality test that investigates the ratio of amino acid replacement (nonsynonymous, <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>) to silent (synonymous, <italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>) substitution rates, which indicates selective constraints acting on a given genomic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. As mutations in genes causing amino acid replacements with functional consequences are selected against in contrast to mutations occurring in pseudogenes, we took advantage of the distinctive patterns of <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>ratios to refine the identification of new gene predictions and gene losses occurring in dog.</p><p>Using the above strategies we identified 232 canine genes for which synteny conservation, cross-species sequence analysis and the neutral rate of evolution based on <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>results converged strongly to support their existence. In addition, we identified 69 gene-loss candidates of which predictions for which accumulating ORF-disrupting mutations, and significant <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>ratios support scenarios of 21 genes lost as pseudogenes in the canine species. To further characterize gene losses, we inferred their phyletic pattern in ten species from chicken to human over a period of 310 million years. Therefore, we were able to differentiate canine-specific losses from gene losses that have occurred in others lineage or genes formed after the evolutionary branchpoint leading to dog.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using all annotated genes from human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat and dog (Ensembl v42) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], we extracted 412 genes annotated as protein-coding in all species but dog. These genes exhibit a '1:1:1:1:0' phyletic pattern, that is indicative of the presence/absence of genes with a one-to-one orthologous relationship among the five species. We refer to these as 'missing genes' for purposes of this study. We examined the structural features of the 412 missing genes in the four mammalian reference sequences and compared them to an independent and randomly selected set of 400 genes. The mean length of the protein products of the missing genes set was 722 amino acids (AA), which is significantly smaller than the random set at 905 AA (<italic>t </italic>test; <italic>P </italic>= 6.8e - 11). Similarly, the mean transcript size was ~50% smaller than observed in a random set (<italic>t </italic>test; <italic>P </italic>= 2.6e - 9). The mean number of exons in missing genes was also smaller (5.8 vs 9.8; <italic>t </italic>test;<italic>P </italic>= 3.7e - 13) than the random set and particularly single-exon genes were found to be over represented by 15%. To ensure that single-exon missing genes were functional and not processed pseudogenes, we analyzed each, using the human dataset, for accumulated degenerative mutations (frameshifts and premature stop codons) in their coding sequence and found none. In addition, we identified sequence alignment between single-exon genes and ESTs (sequence similarity &#x0003e; 96% for at least 150 bp) for 95% of them.</p><p>To test the underlying assumption that missing genes may be implicated in particular biological pathways, we examined their functional annotation in the context of Gene Ontology (GO) using the program GO Tree Machine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Using the human sequence as a reference, the results demonstrate that the missing gene set is enriched for genes implicated in physiological pathways of immunity and organism responses to pathogens (12 genes), olfaction (16) and regulation of transcription (63). This classification comprises functional pathways that play an important role in the adaptation of organisms to their environment. Interestingly, these biological functions are often linked to large proteins families that are attractive targets for lineage-specific functions and lineage-specific loss and gain of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><sec><title>Constructing synteny maps with 1:1 orthologs</title><p>We extracted pairwise sets of 14,997; 14,798; 14,667 and 14,065 one-to-one (1:1) orthologous protein-coding genes (Ensembl v42) between human and dog (H-D), chimpanzee-dog (C-D), mouse-dog (M-D) and rat-dog (R-D), respectively. Using those 1:1 orthologs as comparative anchors, we built four fine-scale whole-genome pairwise synteny maps (Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) with the program AutoGRAPH, which we recently developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We identified 218, 229, 326 and 325 CSOs, i.e. chromosomal segments for which markers are in the same linear order on the chromosome as noted across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], between H-D, C-D, M-D and R-D respectively. The mean distance between two consecutive genes was ~180 kb. In all synteny maps, CSOs cover almost the entire genome while breakpoint regions, areas delimitating CSOs, cover only ~5% of a genome and may contain single-gene segment or very short synteny blocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] (Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><p>In each pairwise synteny map, we localized the missing gene orthologs on the reference sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Of the 412 missing genes, the vast majority (mean of 92.3%; range 92 to 94%) mapped within CSOs with only 7.7% mapping within breakpoints. In all reference species the missing genes spanned all chromosomes, although their distribution varied greatly, i.e. one to 44 per human (HSA) chromosome in the case of the human-dog synteny map.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Consensus Ortholog IntervaL identification</bold>.

On each reference genome, these intervals are delimited by the closest flanking 1:1 orthologs on either side of each missing gene that in turn define orthologous intervals on the canine genome as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The use of multiple pairwise maps enabled us to identify the shortest consensus interval on the canine genome to search for genes, that we refer to as Consensus Ortholog IntervaLs (COILs) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). From the 412 missing genes, we delimited 383 COILs (92.9%) having a mean size of 347 kb (Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). For a set of 17 COILs (4.1%) localized in common breakpoint regions (i.e. overlapping between at least two species) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and for 12 missing genes, no COIL could be determined because of the absence of a consensus interval.</p></sec><sec><title>Targeted gene prediction</title><p>Within each canine COIL, we used the GeneWise program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] to splice and align the protein sequence of each reference species in order to most accurately predict the structure of the dog gene. We retained gene predictions produced by at least two reference species protein templates. This produced 231 gene structure predictions with amino acid identity &#x0003e; 40% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Fifty-three genes were predicted using only rodent protein sequence as templates, thus illustrating the complementary contribution of multispecies analysis. We post-processed GeneWise results to detect potential gene features and found the presence of a coding start site for 53.1% of the gene predictions. In addition, amongst the 231 predicted genes, 75% of the predictions with multi-exonic structure exhibit at least a canonical splice site (GT/AG).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Flowchart of the computational analysis</bold>.

We repeated the analysis with chimpanzee, mouse and rat transcript sequences. We considered the best five matching sequences to relax the limitations of conventional best-match methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Then, we defined a concordance between the COIL approach and the whole-genome sequence analysis, when matching sequences from the Exonerate-based analysis for at least two species were totally embedded in COILs. Based on this criterion, concordance was obtained for 342 (89.2%) genes. Of the 41 instances with no agreement between the expected syntenic location and the whole-genome sequence analysis, 36 showed weak match (identity &#x0003c; 20%) within the canine genome assembly suggesting unspecific alignment while five showed a significant match, from at least two species suggesting that these genes may have acquired a new location in the dog. Of the latter five instances, we identified only one gene prediction (<italic>PLA2G4C</italic>) with conservative criteria indicating a relocated gene in a non-syntenic genomic area.</p><p>In this study, we applied Genewise program with a sequence similarity-based method that explicitly models the conservation of gene structure and a high degree of conservation. As such model is known to show a marked decrease in performance for less similar genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], we further investigate the undetected subset of genes using a probabilistic pair hidden Markov model (HMM) that show a weaker dependence on percent identity and performs better to pick out distant homologs. The Genewise HMM based analysis allowed to predict 36 additional genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Both prediction sets were merged into a single set (n = 268) for further analysis.</p><p>Sequence alignments were next generated between gene predictions and canine transcript sequences (Unigene april 08 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]). We identified significant alignment (sequence similarity &#x0003e; 96% for at least 150 bp) in 53% of cases with an average of 7.5 ESTs/mRNA per gene prediction (range 1&#x02013;99). Using Interproscan, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] protein motifs were found from InterPro database for 80.5% of the gene predictions, providing additional evidence for dog gene identification.</p><p>As a further validation step, the construction of canine predicted protein three-dimensional models was investigated based on the homologous structure of the human ortholog or paralog (&#x0003e;40% identity), which was used as a template. For the subset of genes for which the 3D structure is solved (n = 21), canine-human comparative modelling was determined using the SWISS-MODEL server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In 16 instances of canine-human comparative modelling, the mean identity obtained between sequences was 70%. Homology-based 3D model for each canine prediction was validated using the Verify 3D graphs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] (data not shown) that distinguish between homology models of higher and lower accuracy.</p><p>To test for possible overlap between gene predictions obtained in this study and all canine genes annotated in Ensembl (v42), we performed sequence alignment between these two sets of predictions. A total of 232 (88%) predicted genes did not overlap any Ensembl annotated protein-coding genes. Therefore, these were classified as "definite" gene identifications together with the delineation of new orthologous relationships with the four reference species (Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). The remaining 36 gene predictions overlapped an annotated gene (protein identity &#x0003e; 80%) indicating that these gene predictions correspond to sequences already defined as genes, but with undetected or spurious orthologous relationships (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Gene prediction assessment from <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS </italic>analysis</title><p>To assess the validity of gene predictions through the strength and direction of selective constraints, we used a functionality test that uses the ratio of replacement to silent nucleotide substitution rates (<italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>). The ratio <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>, where <italic>d</italic><sub>N </sub>is the number of non-synonymous nucleotide substitution per non-synonymous site and <italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>the number of synonymous nucleotide substitution per synonymous site, is used as a proxy for the evolutionary constraints that occur on nucleotide substitution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The calculation of the <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>ratio requires the comparison to a homologous reference sequence. First, we constructed a benchmark set of true orthologous genes using all 1:1 orthologous genes between human and dog (n = 14,994) to obtain a representative <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>value. From this benchmark set, we calculated the median <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>ratio of 0.15 using all <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>values extracted from the pairwise alignments of transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). To assess the 232 gene predictions identified in this study with the functionality test, we determined <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>ratio for each of the gene predictions in comparison to their human functional orthologous gene from pairwise transcripts alignments. We calculated a median <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>of 0.19, a value highly similar to the benchmark set (0.15). To further assess the <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>comparison, <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>values were analyzed through their distributions (as log <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>) between benchmark and predicted genes sets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and we did not detect statistically significant differences (Mann-Whitney test; <italic>P </italic>= 0.16). Therefore <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>similar distributions are indicative of similar high selective constraints and little or no positive selection on both benchmark and predicted genes sets, suggesting the functional properties of the canine gene predictions products involved are conserved.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold><italic>D</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>cumulative frequency distribution of references, gene predictions and pseudogene predictions sets</bold>.

Among pseudogenes, we determined if protein sequences have different numbers of in-frame stop codons and/or frameshift disruptions. Using such quantitative measures, two mutation levels were apparent. A set of inactivated genes (n = 21) was predicted with accumulated mutations (mean = 4.2; range 2&#x02013;11) and a second set (n = 34) was predicted with one mutation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). To normalize the mutation rate by taking into account the coding sequence length, we expect proteins of similar lengths to now have similar numbers of stop-codons or a frameshift. We therefore examined the ratio of accumulation of ORF-disrupting mutations per 100 AA in both groups of pseudogenes. A mutation rate of 0.28 was determined for the group of pseudogenes with one mutation and a significant higher rate of 1.21 (Mann-Whitney test; <italic>P </italic>= 8.052e - 7) was found for the set of pseudogenes with accumulated mutations.</p><p>Although transcribed pseudogenes have been experimentally identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], a significant part of pseudogenes are thought to be transcriptionally silent in comparison to protein-coding genes.

We obtained alignment for 14%, a result in agreement with a recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] showing that 19% of pseudogenes are the sources of novel RNA transcripts. These data indicate that the predicted pseudogenes are mostly undetected as expressed sequences in comparison to gene predictions with intact ORF (53%) and therefore significantly correspond to untranscribed pseudogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Detecting nonfunctionality from <italic>dN</italic>/<italic>dS </italic>analysis</title><p>To assess independently of the presence of stop codons or frame-shifts, the validity of pseudogene predictions, we used the functionality test that uses the <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S </sub>ratio.

For these predictions with no readily identifiable counterparts in dog, we searched for sequence alignment with canine expressed sequences (Unigene april 08) to address the underlying assumption that genes are not transcribed when placed in the context of highly degraded sequence. We identified sequence alignment in only three cases. These results showed that the gene predictions with poor sequence similarity were largely undetected as expressed sequences in comparison to gene predictions with intact ORF.</p><p>For the last subset of 49 canine genes that remained undetected in this study, we address the possibility that gene predictions could have been prevented because of a gap in the canine sequence assembly. We searched for gap content in the COILs that lack canine orthologous genes.

The 12 missing genes in those short targeted regions were therefore not retained in further analysis. Based on these results, a total of 37 undetected genes was considered and merged with the 11 gene predictions that could not be detected with sufficient protein identity and the 21 pseudogenes into a single set (n = 69) of gene loss candidates for further analyses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionary scenarios of the canine gene losses</title><p>Do we detect losses of genes that occur specifically in the dog or do such losses occur in other mammalian lineages as well?

One way to analyze these possibilities is to determine their phyletic pattern using ten species from chicken to human and to define the amount of time between gene origin and present. The timing of genes origin was defined by searching for 1:1 orthologs between human and nine species. In addition to human, chimp, mouse and rat genome sequence assemblies, we used scaffold assemblies of elephant, tenrec and armadillo from the Afrotheria and Xenarthra superorder and two non-placental genome assemblies of opossum and platypus.

When coupled to a strategy of phyletic pattern analysis, the approach allows differentiation of species-specific gene loss from multiple independent gene loss. Here, focusing on genes that were not detected in the whole-genome assembly of the dog but annotated in four rodents and primates species, we identified 232 new gene and we predicted 69 canine gene loss candidates of which 21 are identified as pseudogenes,</p><sec><title>Targeted gene prediction: strengths and limitations</title><p>A basic application of gene order-based approaches is the capacity to detect short conserved genomic context based on robust orthologous gene pair annotation. Therefore, results are limited by the source of gene annotation. In this study, we used the Ensembl annotation because of its good gene prediction coverage of the four species used as reference genomes. Since annotation of mammalian genome is a continuous process, our gene order-based approach may be improved over the course of time.</p><p>The use of short orthologous genomic intervals filtering has been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. First, it reduces the cost of detecting false-positives as it filters out paralogs, with the exception of those caused by tandem gene duplication, and alignments to processed pseudogenes. Second, it allows a balance between sequence alignment sensitivity versus accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Alternatively, for more divergent sequences, alignment criteria may be relaxed in short pre-defined space where the background noise is significantly reduced compared to a genome scale search.</p><p>In our analysis, predictions may not provide an exhaustive list of gene predictions as inaccuracies may be generated by sequence artifacts that typically exist in draft sequence assemblies. Another issue related to prediction accuracy is the unexpected and unknown level of highly divergence at the nucleotide level. While scenarios of functional sequences with different evolutionary rate in different species exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], we postulated that using protein coding genes with a comparable evolutionary rate amongst four reference species reduces the possibility that a gene evolves independently in the dog species.</p></sec><sec><title>Computational prediction of gene loss</title><p>A corollary to targeted gene prediction is that the absence of prediction strongly predicts gene relocation to a different region or chromosome or a gene loss event. Gene losses arise through retrotransposition or segmental or tandem duplications events followed by inactivation of one copy, or by degenerative mutations. We used a computational analysis to identify genes lost as pseudogenes based on various detrimental sequence mutations such as in-frame stop codons and frameshifts causing or resulting from loss of function. In this study, pseudogenes were separated in two groups, with the group of pseudogenes with one mutation (showing a low mutation rate) and the second group with an elevated mutation rate (&#x0003e;4 mutations, on average). Pseudogene predictions with one mutation could be overstated due to sequence artifacts that exist in the assembly. Indeed, stop codons and frameshifts are accommodated by algorithm like GeneWise. Other programs specifically designed for aligning pseudogenes such as GeneMapper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] may be useful for addressing this problem. Another hypothesis is that pseudogene predictions have existed as pseudogenes (i.e. inactivated) for different amounts of time in the carnivore lineage. The formation of pseudogenes present in the canine genome could have been initiated by different or multiple events rather than have resulted from a continuous process over the course of time. Pseudogene characterization through the ratio of silent to replacement nucleotide substitution rates (<italic>dN/dS</italic>) may be a good indicator of changes in selective constraint that tend to be recent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. It is clear from our analysis that the <italic>dN/dS </italic>approach is useful to assess the evolutionary constraints that occur on nucleotide substitution. However, inferences of selection need to be treated with extreme caution.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional impact of gene loss</title><p>We identified 28 gene losses that have been functional for more than 170 million years, a time period that extends from platypus to human (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Losses of gene in a given species can be considered an adaptive event that may confer selective advantages to an organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Similarly to neutral losses, adaptive losses occurring ~95 MYA (for lineage leading to canid) are expected to leave genomic signatures with ORF-disrupting sequence mutations accumulation due to sequence degeneration. Here, the losses identified are based on ORF-disrupting sequence mutations, absence of EST validation and absence of significant similarity at the protein level. Although highly speculative, one hypothesis is that species-specific gene loss may confer a selective advantage in dog. Among the gene losses we identified were <italic>PROZ</italic>, a vitamin K-dependent protein Z precursor gene involved in response to stimulus that plays a role in blood coagulation. Mammalian blood coagulation is initiated and regulated by a complex network of interactions involved in normal hemostasis. Interestingly, Lindberg <italic>et al</italic>. describes a decrease of the expression of heme and globin related genes that correlate with the tameness trait in silver foxes suggesting that differences in behavior have a genetic basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. A second hypothesis, is that gene loss may be a direct reflection of the loss of redundancy, where functionally overlapping genes cover for the loss of function as for genes involved in sensory functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Among mammals, one-to-one orthologous correspondence can be defined for a large part of gene repertoires. Complex homologous relationships such as one-to-zero and many-to-many ones remain to be deciphered within gene families, for genes with divergent sequence as well as for species-specific genes that have emerged or have been lost through evolution. The combination of multispecies comparative genomics with in-depth gene prediction, accurate consideration of phylogenetic relationship, and timing of gene origin events can predict both gene structure and gene losses in newly sequenced genomes. This, in turn, enhances the integrity of reference genomes. The end result is a higher quality product for all sequenced genomes, regardless of the depth of sequence.
