The epidermis of Stat3-deficient mice was highly sensitive to UVB-induced apoptosis, whereas the epidermis of K5.Stat3C mice was more resistant to UVB-induced apoptosis. In particular, the status of Stat3 influenced the survival of UV-photoproduct cells, including those located in the bulge region of hair follicles. K5.Stat3C mice exhibited significantly increased epidermal proliferation and hyperplasia in response to UVB irradiation, whereas Stat3-deficient mice showed reduced epidermal proliferation and hyperplasia. Expression of target genes regulated by Stat3, such as cyclin D1 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, was increased in epidermis of both control and UVB-irradiated K5.Stat3C mice, and downregulated in epidermis of both control and UVB-irradiated K5Cre.Stat3<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Following UVB irradiation, the formation of skin tumors in K5.Stat3C mice was accelerated and both the incidence and multiplicity of skin tumors was significantly greater than wild-type controls.

UV radiation is divided into three categories: UVA (315-400 nm), UVB (280-315 nm), and UVC (190-280 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Ichihashi <italic>et al.,</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Kraemer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sarasin, 1999</xref>). Among these, UVB is the most important for induction of skin cancer and can induce mutations in critical target genes as well as modulate cellular signal transduction pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Daya-Grosjean and Sarasin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Sarasin, 1999</xref>). Upon UVB irradiation, DNA-damaged keratinocytes may undergo apoptosis through several apoptotic pathways including p53 dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">de Gruijl <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Melnikova and Ananthaswamy, 2005</xref>). Alternatively, UV-induced DNA damage may be repaired. In both cases, the risk of UV-induced skin cancer is reduced. In contrast, dysfunction of these pathways may contribute to the development of UVB-induced skin cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">de Gruijl <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Melnikova and Ananthaswamy, 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is one of a family of cytoplasmic proteins that participate in normal cellular responses to cytokines and growth factors as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bowman <italic>et al.,</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bromberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Levy and Darnell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Levy and Lee, 2002</xref>). Upon activation by a wide variety of cell surface receptors, tyrosine phosphorylated Stat3 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus and modulates the expression of target genes that are involved in various physiological functions including apoptosis (e.g., Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Survivin), cell cycle regulation (e.g., Cyclin D1 and c-Myc), and angiogenesis (e.g., VEGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Darnell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Levy and Darnell, 2002</xref>). Studies have shown that constitutive activation of Stat3 is associated with a number of human tumors and cancer cell lines, including prostate, breast, lung, head and neck, brain, and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alvarez <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Frank, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Li and Shaw, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Masuda <italic>et al.,</italic> 2002</xref>).

The primary mechanism for constitutive activation of Stat3 in human tumors and cancer cell lines appears to be aberrant growth factor signaling rather than genetic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bromberg, 2002</xref>).</p><p id="P4">Recent studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that Stat3 plays critical roles in epithelial carcinogenesis during the initiation, promotion and progression stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kataoka <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kim <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Sano <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>). In this regard, Stat3 is required for both the initiation and promotion stages of carcinogenesis by maintaining survival of DNA-damaged keratinocyte stem cells and by mediating cell proliferation necessary for the clonal expansion of initiated keratinocyte stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004b</xref>). More recent studies using mice in which a constitutively active/dimerized form of Stat3 (Stat3C) was targeted to the proliferative compartment of the epidermis via the bovine keratin 5 promoter (referred to as K5.Stat3C transgenic mice) demonstrated a role in skin tumor progression through modulation of genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>). In addition to its roles in multistage chemical carcinogenesis, several recent studies have shown that Stat3 plays a role in the response of keratinocytes and other cell types to UVB exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Ahsan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Aziz <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Li <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Sano <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Shen <italic>et al.,</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Wheeler <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P5">In the present study, we directly demonstrate an important role for Stat3 in UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis using both skin-specific gain and loss of function Stat3 transgenic mice.

In this study, we further examined the effect of Stat3 activation or deficiency on UVB-induced epidermal apoptosis by examining a longer timecourse and assessing the location of apoptotic cells. Wild-type, K5.Stat3C and Stat3-deficient mice were irradiated with a single dose of UVB (1200 J/m<sup>2</sup>), and apoptotic cells (caspase-3-positive cells) were measured 1, 2, 5 and 10 days later. Consistent with previous results, the number of apoptotic cells was significantly increased in the epidermis of Stat3-deficient mice, whereas the number of apoptotic cells was significantly reduced in the epidermis of K5.Stat3C mice compared with wild-type mice 24 hours after UVB irradiation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). This difference in apoptotic response was maintained throughout the time course examined, although the overall number of apoptotic cells in all three genotypes decreased with time (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Thus, the effects of Stat3 activation or deficiency on UVB-induced epidermal apoptosis persisted for at least 10 days after a single exposure. Further examination of caspase-3-positive cells revealed that the majority of UVB-induced apoptotic cells in Stat3-deficient mice were initially localized in the interfollicular epidermis although a significant number were also observed in the bulge region of the hair follicles (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Thus, the data shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> indicate that Stat3 is a critical factor for maintaining the survival of DNA-damaged keratinocytes, including bulge region keratinocytes, following UVB irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Stat3 affects the survival of photoproduct-containing keratinocytes following UVB irradiation</title><p id="P7">UVB exposure causes DNA damage and mutations in runs of tandemly located pyrimidine residues of DNA and induces primarily CPDs and 6-4 PPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Lippke <italic>et al.,</italic> 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Mitchell and Nairn, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">Setlow and Carrier, 1966</xref>).

Previous studies revealed that there were no differences in the kinetics of disappearance of 6-4 PPs among wild-type, Stat3-deficient, and Stat3-overexpressing keratinocytes up to 8 hours after UVB exposure, suggesting that Stat3 is likely not involved in the repair of UV photoproducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Sano <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005b</xref>). However, as shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, the status of epidermal Stat3 impacts the number of UV-photoproduct-positive cells that persist over time following UVB irradiation. Wild-type, K5.Stat3C and Stat3-deficient mice were irradiated with UVB at 1,200 J/m<sup>2</sup> and the number of 6-4 PP- and CPD-positive cells in the epidermis was compared among the genotypes for up to 10 days after UVB exposure. The number of 6-4 PP-positive cells in the epidermis of all three genotypes disappeared rapidly and could not be detected by immunohistochemistry 5 d after UVB exposure. As shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, at one and two days after UVB irradiation the number of 6-4 PP-positive cells was significantly higher in epidermis of K5.Stat3C mice compared to epidermis of Stat3-deficient mice. In addition, 6-4 PP containing cells were observed in both the interfollicular epidermis as well as in the bulge region of hair follicles. UVB-induced 6-4 PP containing keratinocytes localized in the bulge region were particularly prominent in skin of K5.Stat3C mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">In contrast to 6-4 PPs, CPDs persisted in epidermis of all three genotypes for a longer period. Significant differences in the number of CPD containing keratinocytes between K5.Stat3C and Stat3-deficient mice were apparent by one day after UVB exposure (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). Five days after UVB exposure, significant differences were observed among all three of the genotypes. The number of CPD-positive cells was greater in epidermis of both wild-type and K5.Stat3C mice compared to epidermis from Stat3-deficient mice at 5 and 10 d after exposure. K5.Stat3C mice had the highest number whereas Stat3 deficient mice had the lowest number of CPD-positive cells at these two time points. Similar to 6-4 PPs, CPD containing keratinocytes were observed in both the interfollicular epidermis as well as in the bulge-region of hair follicles. In addition, CPD containing bulge-region keratinocytes appeared to persist longer than those in the interfollicular epidermis, especially in K5.Stat3C mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Stat3 plays a specific role in the survival of keratinocytes (including bulge region keratinocytes) that have acquired UVB-induced DNA damage, especially CPDs, and that in the absence of Stat3 (i.e., K5Cre.Stat3<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice) these cells are lost more rapidly from both epidermal compartments.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>UVB-induced keratinocyte proliferation and epidermal hyperplasia is dependent on Stat3</title><p id="P9">Keratinocyte proliferation and epidermal hyperplasia are induced in response to UVB irradiation following an initial increase in apoptosis in mouse epidermis.

To further examine the effect of Stat3 activation in UVB-induced keratinocyte proliferation and epidermal hyperplasia over an extended time period, wild-type, K5.Stat3C and Stat3-deficient mice were irradiated with UVB at a single dose of 1,200 J/m<sup>2</sup>. Epidermal proliferation and epidermal thickness were then measured 1, 2, 5 and 10 days after UVB exposure. Following UVB exposure, the number of BrdU positive cells in the epidermis increased at 24 and 48 h in wild-type and K5.Stat3C transgenic mice. In contrast, there was only a slight increase in the Stat3-deficient mice at 48 h (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Similar to the previous results, the percentage of BrdU-positive cells was significantly increased in the epidermis of K5.Stat3C mice 24 and 48 hours after UVB irradiation compared with wild-type and Stat3-deficient mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). Although BrdU-positive cells were reduced in all three groups of mice at the later time points (5 and 10 days) post UVB irradiation, the number of BrdU-positive cells in K5.Stat3C mice remained significantly greater than those in Stat3-deficient mice. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref> shows representative BrdU-stained sections from wild-type, K5.Stat3C and Stat3-deficient mice at 24 and 48 h post UVB treatment.

Further analyses provided direct evidence that Stat3 was required for survival of keratinocytes, including those located in the bulge region of hair follicles. In addition, we obtained evidence showing that Stat3 regulated survival of UV-photoproduct (i.e., CPD and 6,4-PPs) containing keratinocytes, including those located in the bulge-region of hair follicles. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Stat3 regulates the long-term epidermal proliferative and epidermal regenerative response following UVB-exposure. Finally, we showed that Stat3 is required for UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis through evaluation of the susceptibility of both K5.Stat3C transgenic mice and skin specific Stat3-deficient mice. Collectively, these studies provide direct evidence for a critical role of Stat3 in UVB-induced skin cancer.</p><p id="P16">Previously, we found that Stat3 deficiency increased, whereas expression of Stat3C decreased responsiveness of mouse keratinocytes to UVB-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Sano <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005b</xref>). Furthermore, we also reported similar findings following treatment with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004b</xref>). Following topical treatment with DMBA, the majority of apoptotic cells induced in Stat3-deficient mice were localized in the bulge region of hair follicles. The current data show that a significant number of apoptotic cells induced in Stat3 deficient mice following UVB treatment were located in the bulge-region of hair follicles. Stat3 is known to regulate anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Grad <italic>et al.,</italic> 2000</xref>) and Survivin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Gritsko <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>), which play a role in Stat3-mediated cell survival. As shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, the level of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in wild-type, K5.Stat3C and K5.Cre.Stat3<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice both in the absence and presence of UVB treatment correlated with the susceptibility to UVB-induced apoptosis. Previous studies have also shown that modulating the levels of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in keratinocytes significantly altered susceptibility to UVB-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Pena <italic>et al.,</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Umeda <italic>et al.,</italic> 2003</xref>).

Collectively, these findings demonstrate that Stat3 plays a critical role in maintaining the survival of keratinocytes (including keratinocyte stem cells located in the bulge-region of hair follicles) following exposure to both DMBA and UVB irradiation and that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> likely accounts for at least some of Stat3 actions in this regard. Additional studies will be required to determine exactly which additional survival genes regulated by Stat3 also contribute to these effects in keratinocytes and keratinocyte stem cells. Nevertheless, these data argue strongly that Stat3 plays an important role in the initiation of UVB-induced skin tumors.</p><p id="P17">An interesting aspect of the current study was the analysis of UV-photoproduct containing cells in epidermis of wild-type, K5.Stat3C and Stat3-deficient mice following UVB irradiation. A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Nijhof <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>) reported that UV-photoproducts (i.e., 6-4 PPs and CPDs) accumulated in epidermal basal cells, including putative stem and progenitor cells following chronic UVB exposure to skin of SKH-1 hairless mice. Our current results are consistent with these recent findings and show that both 6-4 PP-and CPD-containing keratinocytes can be found in hair follicles after only a single, large UVB exposure and that these cells appear to persist longer than those in the interfollicular epidermis. In human skin, NER repairs both CPD and 6-4 PP, but 6-4 PP repair is much faster that CPD repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">de Laat <italic>et al.,</italic> 1999</xref>). Consistent with this observation, 6-4 PP-containing cells were eliminated from the interfollicular epidermis within 5 days after UVB irradiation, whereas CPD-containing cells were found as late as 10 days after UVB irradiation in mouse skin (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Our previous studies indicated that the antiapoptotic function of Stat3 was not associated with altered NER following UVB irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Sano <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005b</xref>), however, the data in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> demonstrates that Stat3 is required for maintaining survival of UV-photoproduct bearing keratinocytes. Consistent with this statement, we found that UV-photoproduct containing cells were more prominent in hair follicles from K5.Stat3C mice. These data further support the conclusion that Stat3 plays a role in the initiation of UVB carcinogenesis through its affects on DNA damaged keratinocytes, including DNA-damaged bulge-region keratinocytes.</p><p id="P18">In addition to its antiapoptotic role, Stat3 activation promotes epidermal proliferation by regulating specific target genes, such as cyclin D1, cyclin E and c-myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kim <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Leslie <italic>et al.,</italic> 2006</xref>). Previous studies showed that Stat3 deficiency resulted in a reduction of TPA-induced epidermal hyperproliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004b</xref>), whereas Stat3C expression increased TPA-induced epidermal hyperproliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>). Similarly, UVB-mediated epidermal hyperproliferation and regeneration were significantly increased in Stat3C mice and decreased in Stat3-deficient mice (see <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The levels of both cyclin D1 and cyclin E in the absence and presence of UVB-exposure correlated with Stat3 activation status and susceptibility to UVB-induced epidermal proliferation (see <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Cyclin D1 levels are known to increase throughout UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Cooper <italic>et al.,</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Kim <italic>et al.,</italic> 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Kim <italic>et al.,</italic> 2002b</xref>). Furthermore, cyclin D1 has been shown to be important for chemically-mediated skin tumorigenesis. In this regard, cyclin D1 knockout mice display a significantly reduced sensitivity to two-stage chemical carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Robles <italic>et al.,</italic> 1998</xref>). Thus, our current data, which are very similar to our earlier studies showing that TPA-induced epidermal hyperproliferation in K5.Stat3C and Stat3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004b</xref>) correlated with levels of cyclin D1, cyclin E and c-myc, suggest that cyclin D1 together with other Stat3 regulated genes that control G1&#x02192; S phase transition are responsible, in part, for its effects on UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis.</p><p id="P19">Finally, UVB skin carcinogenesis studies revealed that Stat3C mice were more susceptible to UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis with increased skin tumor development, whereas Stat3-deficient mice were more resistant to UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis with reduced skin tumor formation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, respectively). These results obtained for UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis are remarkably similar to the results obtained from two-stage skin carcinogenesis studies using DMBA as the initiator and TPA as the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004b</xref>). Interestingly, Stat3-deficient mice were completely resistant to skin tumor development induced by the DMBA/TPA, initiation-promotion protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004b</xref>), whereas about 30% of Stat3-deficient mice developed tumors induced by the UVB carcinogenesis protocol. Thus, under the current experimental conditions, Stat3-deficient mice, although highly resistant were not completely resistant to UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis. One possible explanation for this difference may be that during UVB carcinogenesis a subset of cells acquire additional genetic alterations that confer a growth advantage, even in the absence of Stat3. In support of this hypothesis are the data shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c and d</xref>. These data show that the UVB-induced tumors that grow in Stat3 deficient mice have low levels of Stat3 and phospho-Stat3. Further work will be required to verify this interesting hypothesis. Nevertheless, the function and underlying mechanisms for the role of Stat3 during UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis appear to be very similar to those observed for two-stage skin carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Kataoka <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Kim <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Sano <italic>et al.,</italic> 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P20">In conclusion, using both skin-specific gain and loss of function Stat3 transgenic mice, we provide direct evidence that Stat3 is a critical regulator in UVB skin carcinogenesis by promoting cell survival and proliferation during UVB exposure. Further studies on specific Stat3 target genes involved in UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis will aid in understanding the role of Stat3 signaling in this process. Overall, these studies further support the suggestion that Stat3 is an important target for prevention of skin cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S10"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="S11"><title>Animals</title><p id="P21">Development of transgenic mice whose keratinocytes express a constitutively active form of Stat3 (K5.Stat3C) and skin specific Stat3-deficient mice (K5Cre.Stat3<sup>fl/fl</sup>) have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">Sano <italic>et al.,</italic> 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Sano <italic>et al.,</italic> 1999</xref>).

Transgenic mice and non-transgenic littermates were used at 7-8 weeks of age and experiments were carried out with strict adherence to institutional guidelines for minimizing distress. The dorsal skin of each mouse was shaved 48 hours before UVB irradiation; only those mice in the resting phase of the hair cycle were used. For UVB irradiation, Westinghouse FS20 sun lamp bulbs with a peak emission at 313 nm were used. The fluence rate was measured with an IL1400A Radiometer/Photometer coupled to a SEL240/UVB-1/TD detector (International Light, Inc., Newburyport, MA).
