At a dose of 10 mg/kg bodyweight, mice developed a typical early-phase acute lung injury, characterized by lung edema, neutrophil influx, hypoxemia and reduced lung compliance. In the late phase, monocrotaline pyrrole injection resulted in limited lung fibrosis and no obvious pulmonary hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Monocrotaline and monocrotaline pyrrole pneumotoxicity substantially differs between the animal species.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a severe disease characterized by elevated pulmonary blood pressure and pathological changes in the lung. These changes, such as endothelial injury, and the proliferation and migration of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells, lead to a reduction in the lumenal area of pulmonary vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. They are also accompanied by right ventricular hypertrophy and end-stage heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Animal models are important tools for the study of the pathogenic mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension (PH), and for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Established models of PH include chronic exposure to hypoxia, and subcutaneous or intraperitoneal application of monocrotaline (MCT) or monocrotaline pyrrole (MCTP) in different mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Increased shear stress by pneumonectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], ductus arteriosus ligation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] or anastomosis of the systemic arterial to the pulmonary arterial circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] have been employed as alternative stimuli. Importantly, however, there are very few mouse models of PH, despite the obvious value of being able to manipulate the genetic background of mice. Chronic exposure of mice to hypoxia is the most common mouse model of PH. Under chronic hypoxic exposure, pulmonary vascular remodeling occurs within weeks. This remodeling process is characterized by <italic>de novo </italic>muscularization of previously non-muscular precapillary vessels, and right heart hypertrophy.</p><p>In transgenic mouse models, hypoxia has been repeatedly used to unmask the protective or deteriorating effects of a targeted gene. It has been shown that transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6) knockout mice are protected against pulmonary vascular remodeling induced by hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similarly, 5-lipoxygenase knockout animals exhibit decreased vascular remodeling in response to hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Conversely, prostacyclin receptor knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] or mice over-expressing the 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] develop more severe pulmonary hypertension. However, the nature of the remodeling differs between species, and it has been shown that mice kept under chronic hypoxia develop less PH than do rats maintained under comparable conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The most aggressive form of PH in any animal model is induced by injection of MCT, which is extracted from plants of the genus <italic>Crotalaria </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], into rats. Although not completely understood, the proposed mechanism of action includes activation of the crude MCT alkaloid to the putative electrophile monocrotaline pyrrole (MCTP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] in the liver, which causes endothelial injury in the pulmonary vasculature with subsequent remodeling of the precapillary vessels and progressive pulmonary hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The limited opportunities to investigate genetic contributions to the pathophysiology of the pulmonary hypertension using this animal model highlight the importance of mice as laboratory animals. However, mice appear to be more resistant than rats to the effects of MCT, and these mice do not develop PH to the same degree. Injection or oral application of MCT to mice causes liver damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], modest pulmonary fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and immunotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It has been proposed that liver metabolism of MCT to MCTP by the cytochrome P450 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] system may differ between these species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To circumvent this, <italic>in vitro </italic>methods have been developed to synthesize MCTP chemically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], which is then stable in dimethyl formamide (DMF). Intravenous injection of the chemically-synthesized MCTP into the right atrium induces pulmonary hypertension in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether injection of MCTP results in PH in the two different mouse strains C57Bl/6 and Balb/c, and to characterize the course of the disease. Parts of this study were previously reported in an abstract to European Respiratory Society Conference 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Monocrotaline pyrrole synthesis</title><p>Monocrotaline pyrrole (MCTP) was chemically synthesized according using the methodology of Mattocks et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

Furthermore, seven groups, each consisting of 10 C57Bl/6 mice, received i.v. DMF or MCTP at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight. Mice were randomly assessed for lung compliance, and cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and histological changes in the lung were measured 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after MCTP injection. Another group of five C57Bl/6 mice was i.v. injected with MCTP 10 mg/kg and subjected to flat-panel computed tomography at 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days.</p></sec><sec><title>MCT and MCTP injection</title><p>Injection of rats with the MCT was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Control rats received subcutaneous saline. For MCTP injection, mice or rats were anesthetized by intra-peritoneal injection with ketamine/xylazine. During the procedure, animals were placed on a heating pad to maintain body temperature in the physiological range. The jugular vein was surgically exposed, and MCTP was injected intravenously according to the body weight using a low volume syringe (Hammilton, Swiss) and a 30 G needle. The incision was sutured and local disinfection was performed. Surgery was performed under aseptic conditions. After surgery, mice received oral antibiotics (Baytril<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>1 ml/250 ml in drinking water).</p></sec><sec><title>Hemodynamic measurements</title><p>Hemodynamic measurements were performed in rats four weeks after MCT or MCTP administration, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

Animals were deeply anaesthetized as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and the systemic arterial pressure (SAP) was monitored by cannulating the left carotid artery using a polyethylene cannula connected to a fluid-filled force transducer.

Briefly, three successive instillations of 0.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline/EDTA (1%) were performed. The recovered BALF was centrifuged, the pellet was resuspended in saline solution and the total cell number was determined using a Neubauer chamber. For differential cell-counts, samples from BALF were spun onto a slide with a cytospin centrifuge (Shandon, Frankfurt, Germany) and stained with May-Gr&#x000fc;nwald-Giemsa. The relative numbers of each cell type were determined by direct assessment under 200&#x000d7; microscopic magnification, and expressed as a percentage of the total cell population present in the BALF.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue processing</title><p>After measurement of hemodynamic parameters, animals were exsanguinated by opening the carotid artery and blood samples were collected. The left lobe of the lung was used to assess the lung wet/dry weight ratio measurement. The right lung was flushed through the pulmonary artery with saline, and fixed with a 2% formalin-based solution through the pulmonary circulation, using a constant pressure of 22 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. A counter pressure of 11 cm H<sub>2</sub>O was used on the alveolar side during fixation, in order to preserve the anatomical structure of the lung. Lung lobes were embedded in parafin blocks, and serial sections of 3 &#x003bc;m thickness were prepared and stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin and Masson's trichrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Flat-panel Computed Tomography</title><p>The fpvCT is a novel high-resolution CT system developed by General Electric (GE Global Research, Niskayuna, NY). In contrast to clinical CT scanners, an amorphous silicon flat-panel detector is irradiated by a cone-shaped X-ray beam. Animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture containing ketamine (Ketavet 100 mg/ml, Pharmacia &#x00026; Upjohn) and xylazine (Rompun 2%, Bayer AG) and mounted on a table, which was then moved into the gantry bore during the scan, while the X-ray tube and detector, mounted on a rotating gantry, rotated around the table. The scan was performed in a sequential rather than a helical mode. For our investigations, 120 kVp at 40 mA was used. The scanning time for one rotation was 8 seconds, covering a field-of-view of 4.2 cm in the z-direction, sufficient for scanning the thorax of one mouse. Projection images were reconstructed using a cone-beam algorithm and an edge-defining reconstruction kernel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

This revealed that the MCTP preparation obtained was pure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Subcutaneous injection of MCT in Sprague Dawley rats at a dose of 60 mg/kg resulted in dramatic increase in right ventricular systolic pressure (76.87 &#x000b1; 4.87 versus 25.08 &#x000b1; 1.35 for control, *p &#x0003c; 0.05) and severe right heart hypertrophy (0.64 &#x000b1; 0.01 versus 0.30 &#x000b1; 0.01 for control, *p &#x0003c; 0.05) after four weeks. The MCTP was dissolved in DMF and injected intravenously into rats at a dose of 5 mg/kg.

Lung edema was still present at seven days after treatment, but was resorbed by days 14&#x02013;21. At day 28, no lung edema was apparent, but some areas of the lung developed fibrotic foci, starting on day 7 and culminating on day 28. These changes were accompanied by cellular inflammatory infiltrates, where lymphocytes were the prominent inflammatory cells present in the late phase, while granulocytes were prominent in the early phase. The vascular smooth muscle layer was not obviously affected at any of the time-points investigated, but consistent adventitial and perivascular edema was seen in at early-time points after MCTP injection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Fibrotic changes in mice injected with MCTP were assessed by Masson's trichrome staining and lung compliance measurements.

In the late phase (28 days), lung compliance was similar to normal values, and lung edema disappeared, but localized limited fibrotic foci had formed. Interestingly, small pulmonary arteries did not show obvious signs of muscularization even in the fibrotic areas which were most likely the more strongly affected areas of the lung (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

In rats, the subcutaneous injection of MCT causes endothelial injury in the pulmonary vasculature with subsequent remodeling of the precapillary vessels (medial thickening, <italic>de novo </italic>muscularization of small pulmonary arterioles). Due to this mimicry of clinical pulmonary arterial hypertension, the rat MCT model has repeatedly been employed for investigating acute hemodynamic and gas exchange effects of vasodilators and the chronic anti-remodeling effects of anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Reproducible induction of severe, progressive pulmonary hypertension in response to MCT has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Although MCT has been used for the past five decades, the mechanism of action is still not clear. The proposed mechanism of action includes activation of MCT by liver cytochromes to a putative electrophile monocrotaline pyrrole (MCTP) which is highly reactive and possesses a short half life of 3&#x02013;4 s in aqueous solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In the blood, it might circulate associated with red blood cells which stabilize and transport it to the active site, for example, the lung endothelium.</p><p>Previous studies have reported that the administration of MCT in mice in different forms, such as from the <italic>Crotalaria spectabilis </italic>plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], by the oral administration of crude alkaloid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] or subcutaneous injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Vascular and lung parenchymal inflammation, lung edema, moderate lung fibrosis and minor right heart hypertrophy were reported in these studies. Most of these studies have suggested that mice are comparatively deficient in the liver enzymes that convert MCT to its active metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>As mice are highly attractive for pulmonary hypertension research due to the possibility of using genetically-engineered animals, multiple groups have attempted to establish new mouse models of pulmonary hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We chemically dehydrated MCT to MCTP according to a methods of Mattocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and injected different doses intravenously into two different mouse strains (C57Bl 6 and BALB/c). Thin layer chromatograms confirmed the purity of chemically-synthesized MCTP. In addition, a positive control experiment included the injection of the synthesized MCTP into rats. This confirms MCTP as being the active metabolite of MCT, and demonstrates the efficacy of chemical synthesis. The difference in the degree of pulmonary hypertension induced by MCTP and MCT might correlate with the different bioavailability, and dose differences (5 mg/kg for MCTP versus 60 mg/kg for MCT). When injected intravenously, MCTP led to dose-dependant mortality of both mouse strains within the first week due to dyspnoea, pleural liquid accumulation, lung edema and severe infiltration of inflammatory cells into lung interstitium. Those animals which survived exhibited similar signs and symptoms including minor elevation of pulmonary pressure and right heart hypertrophy which was not significant compared to the control animals. A slight increase in pulmonary artery pressure was present in the early phase after MCTP administration and was not sustained or progressive. This phenomenon may be attributed to massive lung injury and inflammation which is usually associated with local cytokine and other mediator release, for example, of TNF or thromboxane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In this regard, Molteni <italic>et al </italic>reported dysregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme, plasminogen activator and prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>) after MCT injection in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Histopathological changes in the lungs of mice injected with MCTP consisted in the early phase of perivascular and interstitial lung edema and diffuse alveolar damage with alveolar hyaline membranes and inflammatory cell infiltration. The cellular profile in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid demonstrated the significant increase in granulocytes which is a characteristic feature of acute respiratory distress syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The abovementioned histopathological changes, together with the inflammatory syndrome, are hallmarks of acute lung injury. The initial inflammation and alveolar damage was followed in the later phase by moderate localized lung fibrosis. Lung compliance decreased significantly only in the early time points due to fluid accumulation. Interestingly, these animals seem to recover over time in terms of lung compliance, exhibiting similar values at 28 days to the control animals. Histopathological changes assessed by Haematoxylin-Eosin and Masson's trichrome staining revealed obvious fibrotic changes.</p><p>Similar changes have been reported by previous studies in which MCT was administered in different forms. A major objective of this study was to investigate whether MCTP induces pulmonary hypertension in mice. We carefully investigated the physiological and histological parameters of pulmonary hypertension in these animals. Pathologically, these animals presented with a pseudo-wall-thickness of small pulmonary arteries induced by adventitial and perivascular edema, but there was no obvious sign of muscularization or neo-muscularization of these vessels. Right ventricular systolic pressure measured by right heart catheterization in anaesthetized animals 28 days after MCTP injection was slightly elevated. However, this did not reach statistically significant levels in any of the groups injected with different doses. This observation is consistent with the assessment of right ventricular hypertrophy and histopathological changes reported by Hayashi et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In fact, small pulmonary capillary hypertension is one of the physiological abnormalities of the acute respiratory distress syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Recently, Raoul <italic>et al</italic>. reported elevated pulmonary pressure and right heart hypertrophy in mice 15 days after MCTP injection into the tail vein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Although we used an appropriate and even double the dose of MCTP reported in that study, our study did not reveal significant differences in pulmonary hypertension-related parameters which may be dependant on the mouse strain or the MCTP synthesis. However, considering the importance of a mouse model of pulmonary hypertension, numerous research groups will experiment with different technical approaches which might prove successful. Our findings demonstrate that interspecies differences in response to MCT and lung diseases are not limited to the liver metabolism of these alkaloids. Future experiments assessing mouse and rat endothelial cells in response to MCTP might reveal the basis of the interspecies variability. A technical limitation of the study might be related directly to the MCTP application: a bolus injection of MCTP <italic>versus </italic>slow release after subcutaneous MCT injection. However, bolus injection of MCTP in rats results in pulmonary changes which consistently differ from those induced in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>To conclude, this study reports pathological pulmonary changes induced by an application of the putative electrophile MCTP in mice. Administration of MCTP in mice and rats results in acute lung injury. In rats, but not in mice, it ultimately leads to severe and progressive pulmonary hypertension. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report and characterize an animal model of acute lung injury induced by monocrotaline pyrrole in mice. Thus, MCTP injection in mice may be a valuable animal model to investigate both the efficacy of new therapies for acute respiratory failure and fibrotic repair mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RD, SK, AS and ED performed animal experiments.
