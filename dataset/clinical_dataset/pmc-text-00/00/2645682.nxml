We aim to test the therapeutic utility of Yttrium-90 (<sup>90</sup>Y)-radio-conjugates of a monoclonal antibody, which we showed previously to bind specifically to the abundant intracellular La ribonucleoprotein revealed in dead tumor cells after DNA-damaging treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Immunoconjugates of the DAB4 clone of the La-specific monoclonal antibody, APOMAB&#x000ae;, were prepared using the metal chelator, 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), and then radiolabeled with <sup>90</sup>Y. Mice bearing established subcutaneous tumors were treated with <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 alone or after chemotherapy. Non-radiosensitizing cyclophosphamide/etoposide chemotherapy was used for the syngeneic EL4 lymphoma model. Radiosensitizing cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy was used for the syngeneic Lewis Lung carcinoma (LL2) model, and for the xenograft models of LNCaP prostatic carcinoma and Panc-1 pancreatic carcinoma. We demonstrate the safety, specificity, and efficacy of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4-radioimmunotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy. EL4 lymphoma-bearing mice either were cured at higher doses of radioimmunotherapy alone or lower doses of radioimmunotherapy in synergy with chemotherapy. Radioimmunotherapy alone was less effective in chemo- and radio-resistant carcinoma models. However, radioimmunotherapy synergized with radiosensitizing chemotherapy to retard significantly tumor regrowth and so prolong the survival of mice bearing LL2, LNCaP, or Panc-1 subcutaneous tumor implants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We report proof-of-concept data supporting a unique form of radioimmunotherapy, which delivers bystander killing to viable cancer cells after targeting the universal cancer antigen, La, created by DNA-damaging treatment in neighboring dead cancer cells. Subsequently we propose that DAB4-targeted ionizing radiation induces additional cycles of tumor cell death, which further augments DAB4 binding to produce a tumor-lethal &#x02018;genotoxic chain reaction&#x02019;. Clinically, this approach may be useful as consolidation treatment after a drug-induced cell death among (small-volume) metastatic deposits, the commonest cause of cancer death.</p><p>This article is part II of a two-part series providing proof-of-concept for the diagnostic and therapeutic use of the DAB4 clone of the La-specific monoclonal antibody, APOMAB&#x000ae;.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The therapeutic activity of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) may be improved by arming them with additional effector mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Wu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> such as ionizing radiation that kills neighboring untargeted tumor cells by bystander and/or radiation crossfire effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Chen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved radioimmunotherapy (RIT) uses anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) armed with <sup>131</sup>I (tositumomab) or <sup>90</sup>Y (ibritumomab tiuxetan), which display clinical efficacy even in follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients refractory to rituximab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Goldenberg1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Notwithstanding the clinical utility of CD20-directed RIT for rituximab-refractory NHL, the two approved products have had limited commercial success perhaps because the niche indication for their use necessarily restricts sales, and because the sheer logistical complexity of their application attenuates their clinical acceptance. Moreover, several factors curb the clinical utility of radioimmunotherapy for metastatic carcinoma, which comprises a more populous group of malignancies than lymphoma. Tumor-related factors include radioresistance, and the heterogeneous and low-level expression of target antigens that reduce tumor accumulation of radioimmunoconjugates. Myelosuppression remains the dose-limiting toxicity of radioimmunotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Goldenberg1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In spite of evasion of apoptosis being recognized as a hallmark of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Hanahan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, dead cells remain a common feature of many malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Epstein1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Soini1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, and may increase in number after primary chemotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Chang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Davis1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, the only approved radioimmunotherapy for carcinoma worldwide is tumor necrosis therapy (TNT). TNT-1 is an <sup>131</sup>I-labeled chimeric IgG, which was approved by the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration and which produced an overall objective response rate of 34&#x00025; among patients with advanced lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Chen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Similarly, the 7E11 mAb, which is specific for an internal epitope of the cytoplasmic domain of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA<sup>int</sup>), also binds dead cells such as those of the human LNCaP prostate cancer cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-SmithJones1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

During apoptosis, the La antigen translocates from nucleus to cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Ayukawa1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, and is fixed in dying cells by transglutaminase 2 (TG2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-AlEjeh1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

The safety of the technology was evident by its lack of clinically significant acute and late toxicities and its efficacy by clinically meaningful antitumor activity in mice bearing four different grafts of lymphoma or carcinoma. The therapeutic effect of La-directed radioimmunotherapy was antigen-specific and most pronounced when given after chemotherapy.</p><p>In the chemo-responsive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Zhao1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and radio-responsive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Schmidberger1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> EL4 lymphoma model, we showed that lymphoma-eradicating therapy depended on either the higher 1.80 and 3.60 MBq doses of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 alone or the lower 0.46 and 0.92 MBq doses of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 given 24 hours after chemotherapy. This curative chemoradioimmunotherapy was associated with sustained high levels of both tumor cell death and ex vivo binding dead tumor cell binding of DAB4. Conversely, although the components of the combined therapy individually produced similar extensions of survival of tumor-bearing mice, neither radioimmunotherapy with 0.92 MBq <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 nor chemotherapy successfully eradicated lymphoma. In comparison with curative combined therapy, subcurative lymphoma therapy using either 0.92 MBq <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 or chemotherapy alone induced lower levels of tumor cell death. Therefore, individual treatment at these doses may have failed to cure mice because the stabilization or reduction in tumor cell death at 72&#x02013;96 hours post-treatment reflected tumor cell repopulation as well as dissipating cytotoxic activity.</p><p>Consequently, we hypothesize that curative lymphoma therapy depended on a first step of &#x0201c;target creation&#x0201d; that then produced a second and self-amplifying step of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 binding, which we have styled as a &#x02018;genotoxic chain reaction&#x02019;. Our data suggest that the number of new DAB4 binding targets created by chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy derived from an increased number of dead tumor cells harboring La antigen targets together with increased availability of La antigen targets in each dead tumor cell. For example, in the case of curative single 1.80 or 3.60 MBq doses of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4, the number of La antigen targets present in dead cells of untreated EL4 tumors enabled initial binding of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4. Subsequently, the radiation crossfire of the high-energy &#x003b2;-emissions was sufficient to kill surrounding viable EL4 lymphoma cells, and in turn generated further rounds of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 recruitment to the tumor.</p><p>Additional support for this hypothesis is drawn from the observation that EL4 tumors accumulated significantly greater amounts of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 than would have been predicted by the dosimetry of <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA-DAB4. Moreover, the finding of detergent-resistant retention of DAB4-targeted radioactivity in EL4 tumors only when <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 was given after chemotherapy rather than by itself suggests that tumor accretion of DAB4-targeted radioactivity resulted from increased transglutaminase 2 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-AlEjeh1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. We propose that this phenomenon may be specific to malignant tissue because we did not find any detergent-resistant accumulation of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 in normal tissues after chemotherapy. In particular, although <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 accumulated significantly more in spleen than expected from the dosimetry of <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA-DAB4, none of this accumulation was detergent-resistant. Finally, recent data from studies of the immunopathogenesis of congenital heart block in which La-specific antibodies were shown to inhibit phagocytosis of fetal cardiomyocytes in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Clancy1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> suggests that DAB4-mediated inhibition of the in vivo clearance of DAB4-bound dead tumor cells may also prolong tumor retention of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4.</p><p>In stark contrast to the 70&#x00025; frequency of chemotherapy-induced EL4 lymphoma cell death, we found that cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy approximately doubled tumor cell death rates among LL2 tumors and human tumor xenografts so that these rates remained low at clinically relevant levels of &#x02264;20&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Buchholz1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, we presume that endogenous levels of tumor cell death were sufficient to enable binding of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4, which was effective as monotherapy in all carcinoma models. In addition, administering <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 after chemotherapy produced greater than additive effects on tumor growth delay and survival in all carcinoma models, which we hypothesize resulted at least in part from increased levels of chemotherapy-induced tumor cell death. Although we have not formally investigated this possibility, radiosensitizing cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy may effectively lower the threshold for radiation-induced carcinoma cell death as suggested for non-cytotoxic doses of gemcitabine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Shewach1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, future studies will aim to correlate antitumor effects of combination treatment with measures of tumor cell death, ex vivo tumor cell binding of DAB4, and tumor accumulation of DAB4.</p><p>We found that combination treatment produced greater increments in LL2 tumor doubling time than <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 alone. However, despite doubling doses of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4, the rate of increase in TDT after combination treatment was less than might be expected. Perhaps, as chemotherapy shrinks the tumor, the maximum 12 mm tissue penetration depth of <sup>90</sup>Y-derived &#x003b2;-particles results in much of the energy emanating from DAB4-bound dead tumor cells depositing beyond the confines of the shrinking tumor. Conversely, the maximum 2.5 mm tissue penetration depth and the longer physical half-life of Lutetium-177-derived &#x003b2;-particles suggest that the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy dose escalation may be improved if the deposition of energy within the shrinking LL2 tumor mass is more efficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Koppe1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Having established preclinical proof-of-concept for La-directed &#x003b2;-emitting radioimmunotherapy, as a logical extension, we hypothesize that high-energy &#x003b1;-particles originating from a dead-cell source of a La-bound &#x003b1;-emitting radionuclide will destroy nearby cancer stem cells in small-volume (&#x02264;1 mm<sup>3</sup>) cohesive masses of metastatic carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Sgouros1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Brabletz1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Similar to the mechanism proposed for therapeutic synergy in the EL4 lymphoma model, we propose that the radiosensitizing chemotherapy facilitated a dose-dependent and self-reinforcing accretion of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 in the carcinoma models. In support of this concept, we found that, irrespective of chemotherapy use, matched radiation doses of <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-7E11, which also targets dead PSMA<sup>int&#x0002b;</sup> LNCaP cells, produced appreciably less inhibition of LNCaP tumor regrowth than <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4. Therefore, we propose that <italic>only</italic> binding of dead LNCaP cells by <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 created more targets for its own binding because antibody-directed &#x003b2;-radiation induced and revealed significantly more La antigen targets than PSMA<sup>int</sup> targets in the dead LNCaP cells. Interestingly, expression of PSMA may be lost in LNCaP tumors borne by nude mice after therapeutic intervention (K, Chester, personal communication, University College London Cancer Institute, UK).</p><p>Although the inherently greater chemo- and radio-sensitivity of EL4 lymphoma, which is reflected in its brisk and presumably P53-mediated apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Truksa1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, may help to explain EL4 tumor eradication by the combination of chemotherapy and low doses of La-directed radioimmunotherapy, other factors may account for the reduced and differential sensitivity to this combination treatment of the carcinoma cell lines, LL2, in particular. First, since the LL2 model is syngeneic, its biological aggressiveness compared with the LNCaP and Panc-1 xenograft models may result from the greater compatibility between tumour and host tissues in a syngeneic model. Second, P53 is mutant in the LL2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Rokhlin1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and Panc-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Lang1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> tumors whereas P53 is wild type in the more treatment responsive LNCaP tumor model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Lee1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Tumor doubling time is a third factor to be considered in conjunction with the other factors, particularly because the LL2 tumor has the shortest doubling time. The doubling times of untreated LL2, LNCaP, and Panc-1 tumors were 1.34&#x000b1;0.02, 1.81&#x000b1;0.01, and 4.44&#x000b1;0.02 days, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004630.s003">Table S1</xref> online).</p><p>Finally, we believe that the schedule of chemo-radioimmunotherapy is critically important for both its safety and efficacy. Our companion studies of the biodistribution of <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA-DAB4 in EL4 lymphoma-bearing mice (Al-Ejeh et al., accompanying manuscript) together with our results using <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 in LL2 tumor-bearing mice indicate that this chemo-radioimmunotherapy is safest and most effective if given 24 hours after chemotherapy rather than immediately after chemotherapy. When <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA-DAB4 was administered 24 hours after chemotherapy, both its tumor accumulation and blood clearance were accelerated. In comparision with its administration immediately after chemotherapy, we found that administering <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA-DAB4 24 hours after chemotherapy resulted in significantly reduced accumulation of the radioligand in normal organs such as the gut (Al-Ejeh et al., accompanying manuscript), which is particularly susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy or ionizing radiation.</p><p>Although delaying administration of the radioligand accelerated its blood clearance and thus diminished its blood pool activity in normal organs, other factors may also account for the reduced normal organ accumulation of radioligand. For example, studies of gemcitabine-induced apoptosis of jejunal crypt cells indicate that apoptosis resolves by 24&#x02013;36 hours post-treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Milas1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> perhaps because, in contrast to the apparently <italic>inefficient</italic> clearance of cells in malignant tissues, phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is <italic>efficient</italic> in normal tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Wood1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, we reason that the reduction in normal organ accumulation of radioactivity observed by delaying the injection of <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA-DAB4 until 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy will minimize the exposure of chemosensitive normal tissues such as gut and bone marrow to bystander toxicity emanating from any <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 bound to apoptotic cells in these tissues.</p><p>Confirmation of the therapeutic relevance of delaying the injection of the radioligand until 24 hours after chemotherapy was obtained when <sup>90</sup>Y-DOTA-DAB4 administered to LL2 tumor-bearing mice 24 hours after chemotherapy produced superior antitumor efficacy compared with its administration immediately after chemotherapy. Therefore, we hypothesize that scheduling radioimmunotherapy 24 hours after chemotherapy improves the therapeutic ratio, and hence the clinical utility, of La-targeted chemo-radioimmunotherapy because the therapeutic ratio of any treatment will be improved by reducing its toxicity and/or increasing its efficacy at a given dose.</p><p>In all, we propose that several properties in combination contribute to the efficiency of La-directed radioimmunotherapy and make it superior to other previously described mAb therapies targeting dead cancer cells such as TNT, the antigen target of which is not induced by DNA-damaging chemotherapy in vitro. First, La is a universal and high-density target antigen that is overexpressed in malignant cells. It is also conditionally expressed in malignant cells by DNA-damaging therapy after dead normal cells have been cleared, and it appears to be durably retained in tumors. Second, arming DAB4 mAb with Yttrium-90 generates bystander killing, and then a self-amplifying recruitment of DAB4 that prolongs tumor retention of DAB4.</p><p>Furthermore, the ability of DNA-damaging treatment to create high tumor densities of La target antigen together with the prolonged intratumoral retention of DAB4 may extend the utility of this technology platform to other therapeutic modalities. For example, antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Mayer1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, some antibody-drug conjugates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Erickson1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Kovtun1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, functional nanoparticles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Thierry1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, or genetically engineered T-lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Pule1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, which like radionuclides may amplify therapeutic activity at the target binding site, can also exert bystander killing of tumor cells lacking the target antigen.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide preclinical proof-of-concept data for a unique form of systemic chemo-radioimmunotherapy that targets a universal tumor antigen and subsequently engenders a self-amplifying method of target creation to elicit a genotoxic chain reaction. Thus, this technology may meet the challenge of delivering higher tumor-directed doses of radioimmunotherapy particularly if used with radiosensitizing agents and/or new classes of pro-apoptotic agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Reed1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004630-Labi1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.
