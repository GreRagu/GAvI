Neurotoxicity is the dose-limiting side effect. Previous investigations have reported that acute neurotoxicity could be mediated via voltage-gated ion channels. A possible mechanism for some of the effects is a modification of surface charges around the ion channel, either because of chelation of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, or because of binding of a charged biotransformation product of oxaliplatin to the channel. To elucidate the molecular mechanism, we investigated the effects of oxaliplatin and its chloride complex [Pt(dach)oxCl]<sup>- </sup>on the voltage-gated Shaker K channel expressed in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes. The recordings were made with the two-electrode and the cut-open oocyte voltage clamp techniques.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>To our surprise, we did not see any effects on the current amplitudes, on the current time courses, or on the voltage dependence of the Shaker wild-type channel. Oxaliplatin is expected to bind to cysteines. Therefore, we explored if there could be a specific effect on single (E418C) and double-cysteine (R362C/F416C) mutated Shaker channels previously shown to be sensitive to cysteine-specific reagents. Neither of these channels were affected by oxaliplatin. The clear lack of effect on the Shaker K channel suggests that oxaliplatin or its monochloro complex has no general surface-charge effect on the channels, as has been suggested before, but rather a specific effect to the channels previously shown to be affected.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The platinum-based chemotherapeutic drug oxaliplatin has been used in the clinic for about ten years. The therapeutic indication is metastatic colorectal cancer. The mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is assumed that DNA-adduct formation is one route to cell destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The dose-limiting side effect of oxaliplatin treatment is neurotoxicity. A unique and unpleasant acute neurosensory toxicity with paresthesias and dysesthesias of the distal extremities and perioral region occurs shortly after infusion in as much as 90% of the patients. These symptoms can be worsened or triggered by cold, but are reversed within hours or days after treatment. After cumulative doses of about 800 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>another form of neurotoxicity, with paresthesias and dysesthesias persisting between cycles and problems with sensorimotor coordination is seen in about 10&#x02013;15% of the patients. Most of the patients recover a few months after treatment discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Many patients who receive a clinical benefit from oxaliplatin cannot continue treatment because of worsening neurotoxicity. Our understanding of the mechanism underlying this is limited and research in this area could lead to prolonged treatment with this useful drug.</p><p>Oxaliplatin has a half-life of about 14 minutes <italic>in vivo </italic>and the maximal blood concentration after a 2-hour infusion of 85 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>is 3.6 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The short half-life is explained, at least in part, by the reaction of oxaliplatin with chloride, glutathione, methionine, and cysteine at physiological concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It has been suggested that biotransformation products of oxaliplatin may be responsible for the neurotoxic side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Because the symptoms of acute neurotoxicity may be related to hyperexcitability of sensory neurons, the effects of oxaliplatin on voltage-gated Na and K channels, responsible for the shape of the neuronal action potential, have been examined. Oxaliplatin, in the concentration range from 1 to 500 &#x003bc;M, has been shown to affect both Na and K channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Even though these studies on different preparations report on slightly different effects, there seems to be a general theme: The voltage dependence for the Na and K channels is changed (less positive voltages are needed to open the channels), and the Na current inactivation becomes slower and less complete.</p><p>Because the voltage dependences of both Na and K channels have been reported to be shifted in negative direction along the voltage axis it is tempting to speculate about a common underlying mechanism. One such possible mechanism is a change of the transmembrane electrical field sensed by the voltage sensor of the ion channels. The voltage sensor is a positively charged &#x003b1;-helix responding to changes in the membrane electric field to open the gate of the ion channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Metal ions are well known shifters of the channels' voltage dependence along the voltage axis; an increase in the concentration of positive metal ions makes it harder for the positively charged voltage sensor to open the channel and a decrease in the concentration has the opposite effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Other molecules with shift capacity are polyunsaturated free fatty acids; the negatively charged free fatty acids bind close to the voltage sensor and thereby electrostatically activate the channel by shifting the channels voltage dependence along the voltage axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Thus, the oxaliplatin effect can be caused either (1) indirectly by chelating extracellular calcium ions by oxalate derived from oxaliplatin, or (2) directly by binding the negatively charged chloride complex of oxaliplatin to the channel. In both cases the positively charged voltage sensor will be electrostatically attracted to the extracellular side, thereby activating the channel. To investigate these hypotheses, we explored the effects of oxaliplatin and its chloride complex on the well-characterized voltage-gated Shaker K channel expressed in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Previous investigations have reported effects of oxaliplatin on voltage-gated ion channels. Here, we explored the effect of extracellularly applied oxaliplatin and its monochloro complex ([Pt(dach)oxCl]<sup>-</sup>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) on a well studied voltage-gated K channel, the Shaker K channel expressed in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Chemical structures</bold>.

The cut-open oocyte technique reduces the capacitive current and thereby allows analysis of the activation time course in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The reason for using the Cl<sup>- </sup>-free solution was to avoid any endogenous Cl<sup>- </sup>current which could be provoked by the cut-open oocyte technique. No visible effects were seen, neither on the time course, the amplitude, nor on the channel's voltage dependence (<italic>n </italic>= 5; data not shown). One possible explanation for the lack of effect is that it is only [Pt(dach)oxCl]<sup>- </sup>that exerts effect. Therefore similar experiments with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique were carried out with oxaliplatin added to a Cl<sup>- </sup>-containing (0.1 M) extracellular solution.

Therefore, another explanation for the lack of effects of oxaliplatin is that a critically exposed cysteine residue is lacking in the wild-type channel. To explore this we used the 418C mutation which has a very critical cysteine residue exposed to the extracellular solution. In a previous study we showed that modification of this residue had a large effect on the gating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Again, addition of oxaliplatin failed to affect the currents (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>), suggesting that no binding to or modification of 418C occurs (<italic>n </italic>= 8).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Cysteine-enriched Shaker channel</bold>.

We investigated if a double cysteine mutation (362C/416C), with the cysteines close enough to each other to cause a disulfide bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], could coordinate with a platinum complex.

This suggests that the neurotoxic side effects reported for oxaliplatin cannot be explained with general effects on the channels' voltage dependences.</p><sec><title>Neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin and its degradation products</title><p>Oxaliplatin therapy gives rise to two distinct types of neurotoxicity. One appears after relatively high cumulative doses (10&#x02013;15% incidence at 800 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and this side effect seems to be comparable to the neurotoxicity seen after cisplatin and ormaplatin use and has been shown to affect dorsal root ganglion neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The other type of neurotoxicity is an acute form that appears during or within hours or days after administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The reaction of oxaliplatin with chloride has previously been unravelled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A ring-opened intermediate, the monochloro-monooxalato complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) is rapidly formed (within 30 minutes) in physiologic <italic>in vitro </italic>conditions, constituting about 10% of the intact oxaliplatin. We hypothesized that this reaction product, which is negatively charged, might be responsible for the acute neurotoxic side effects of oxaliplatin treatment. As mentioned in the Introduction, adding positively charged metal ions shift the channel's voltage dependence in positive direction along the voltage axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], while negatively charged compounds shift the voltage dependence in negative direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Similar electrostatic effects have also been demonstrated for covalent modification of cysteines with reagents of different charge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>We know that oxaliplatin is highly reactive towards sulphur containing compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The half-life of oxaliplatin in the presence of 2.5 mM cysteine is for example less than 20 minutes. Some K channel mutations used in the present investigation have target sulphur-containing amino acids (cysteine) at the surface. In spite of this, no measurable effect of oxaliplatin on these ion channel subtypes was recorded. This surprising lack of effect may suggest that the cysteines on the channels surface does not react with oxaliplatin, despite high reactivity with other cysteine-specific reagents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This also suggests that it is unlikely that oxaliplatin-induced side effect is caused by any covalent modification of channel cysteines.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with previous electrophysiological studies</title><p>Several previous investigations have reported acute effects on voltage-gated ion channels, and the oxaliplatin-induced side effects have been suggested to be caused by effects on these voltage-gated ion channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Four of these studies report on positive Na channel effects and two on K channel effects. However, in most of these investigations, very high concentrations of oxaliplatin were used. The maximum blood concentration of intact oxaliplatin after a 2-hour infusion of 85 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>is 3.6 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Three of the studies only used high concentrations of 25&#x02013;500 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], while two of the studies (both of which reported on K channel effects) used more physiologically relevant concentrations down to 1 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>General mechanisms have been suggested. 1) Oxalate liberated from oxaliplatin could exert general effects by chelating Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and thereby affecting fixed surface charges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The present study does not support such a mechanism, since no effects were seen in the ion channel setting in spite of different amounts of oxalate released from oxaliplatin using varying exposure times (5 min-12 h) and concentrations (60&#x02013;1000 &#x003bc;M). Furthermore, it is difficult to understand how the relatively small <italic>in vivo </italic>concentrations of oxalate could be sufficient to deplete the extracellular calcium pool of about 1 mM. Moreover, since the intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration is in the &#x003bc;M range, formation of calcium oxalate intracellularly, as suggested by Grolleau et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], as a precipitate or an ion pair is highly unlikely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>has been reported not to be affected by extracellular oxaliplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. 2) Another possibility is that the negatively charged monochloro-monooxalato complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) exerts general effects by binding directly to ion channels (one of the hypotheses put forward in the present investigation). Neither this is supported in the present investigation.</p><p>A negative shift in the voltage dependence of Na-channel activation that could be responsible for the hyperexcitability seen in the acute oxaliplatin side effects was detected in some investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A slowing of the Na-channel inactivation could also promote hyperexcitability. In some Na channels, such a slowing has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], while it is lacking in other Na channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. All together, this points to channel-specific effects rather than general effects.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Oxaliplatin at relatively high concentrations has been reported to affect the voltage dependence of some ion channels. Here, we have shown that these reported effects are not unspecific channel effects and that these effects are probably not mediated via binding to cysteine amino acid residues. Instead, we propose that the side effects of oxaliplatin are caused by specific channel effects, most likely a slowing of inactivation in some Na channels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Molecular biology and expression of ion channels</title><p>The experiments were performed on the Shaker H4 potassium channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], made incapable of fast-inactivation by the &#x00394;6&#x02013;46 deletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and on the fast inactivating Shaker B channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

The cysteine reagent was applied to saturation (1 mM for 1 minute) followed by carefully washing off MTSET.</p><p>The steady-state K conductance <italic>G</italic><sub>K</sub><italic>(V) </italic>was calculated as <italic>G</italic><sub>K</sub>(<italic>V</italic>) = <italic>I</italic><sub>K</sub>(<italic>V</italic>)/(<italic>V </italic>- <italic>E</italic><sub>K</sub>), where <italic>I</italic><sub>K</sub><italic>(V) </italic>is the steady-state current,<italic>V </italic>is the membrane potential measured in the bulk solutions, and <italic>E</italic><sub>K </sub>is the equilibrium potential (-80 mV).</p><p>To make sure that the platinum-based substances reach the ion channels and do not get stuck in the vitelline layer surrounding the <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes, we tested the effects on oocytes with the vitelline layer mechanically removed. No difference was seen between the recordings with or without the vitelline layer (<italic>n </italic>= 3). Because removal of the vitelline layer makes the oocytes fragile we kept it intact throughout the rest of the experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Oxaliplatin chemistry and oocyte exposure</title><p>Oxaliplatin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved in MilliQ water by ultrasonification for 1 hour resulting in a concentration of 6 mM. Oxaliplatin was then added to the extracellular solution, resulting in a concentration of typically 60, 120, or 240 &#x003bc;M. In most cases we measured the effects directly after oxaliplatin exposure but we also tried application times up to 1 hour. Some experiments were also performed with over-night exposure. For these experiments no control recording could be obtained, making it difficult to explore subtle effects on the ion channel kinetics. To produce the monochloro monooxalato complex ([Pt(dach)oxCl]<sup>-</sup>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) NaCl was added to the oxaliplatin solution to final concentrations of 0.2&#x02013;0.3 M and 1&#x02013;3 mM, respectively and heated for about 20 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C and then quenched on ice. This gives a mixture of oxaliplatin, Pt(dach)Cl<sub>2 </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, trace amounts), and [Pt(dach)oxCl]<sup>- </sup>(about 10%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] This mixture was added to the extracellular solution corresponding to a platinum concentration of 60, 120, or 240 &#x003bc;M.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AB carried out the electrophysiological experiments and drafted the manuscript.
