Because control of Cd translocation and accumulation is likely to be determined by the plants genetics, the Cd contents of grain and the aerial parts of rice may be manipulated to improve food safety and for phytoextraction ability. This study studied Cd translocation and accumulation and their genetic control in aerial parts of rice to provide a starting point for improving food safety and phytoextraction in Cd-contaminated soils.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the <italic>japonica </italic>rice cultivar "Nipponbare", Cd accumulated in leaves and culms until heading, and in culms and ears after heading. Two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from <italic>indica </italic>cv. "Kasalath", <italic>qcd4-1 </italic>and <italic>qcd4-2</italic>, affect Cd concentrations in upper plant parts just before heading. Three near-isogenic lines (NILs) with <italic>qcd4-1 </italic>and <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>were selected from the "Nipponbare" background, and were analyzed for the effects of each QTL, and for interactions between the two QTLs. From the results compared between "Nipponbare" and each NIL, neither QTL influenced total Cd accumulation in aerial parts at 5 days after heading, but the interaction between two QTLs increased Cd accumulation. At 35 days after heading, <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>had increased Cd accumulation in the aerial plant parts and decreased translocation from leaves other than flag leaf, but interaction between the two QTLs increased translocation from leaves.

Cd translocation from roots to culms and ears after heading may direct Cd to the aerial organs without influencing brown rice accumulation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cadmium (Cd) is a harmful heavy metal that may be released into the biosphere by modern industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. On soil with low Cd concentration, plants grow normally, but accumulate Cd in their edible parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The high accumulation of Cd by consumption of food represents a potential human health hazard and international trade standards have been discussed to limit the levels of Cd in exported cereal grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thus, there is a need to understand the physiological processes that control acquisition of Cd from soil solution by roots and mobilization of Cd in plants.</p><p>Phytoextraction of Cd from polluted soil using hyperaccumulator plants with high Cd tolerance (e.g. <italic>Thlaspi caerulescens</italic>) is one of the major engineering-based methods for environmental restoration. However, the use of hyperaccumulator plants might be not suitable for phytoextraction on soil with low Cd contamination levels, because of low Cd uptake efficiency relative to biomass, growth rate, and the cultivation system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recently, several phytoextraction crops which could be grown more efficiently with the local cultivation system were evaluated in soils with low levels of Cd contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This study suggested the use of crops with high Cd accumulation levels might be effective for phytoextraction from soils with low Cd concentrations.</p><p>Cd accumulation in crops is determined by varietal differences as well as by environmental factors. Varietal differences in Cd accumulation were reported in several crops, including wheat (<italic>Triticum sestivum </italic>L.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare </italic>L.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], maize (<italic>Zea mays </italic>L.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], potato (<italic>Solanum tuberosum </italic>L.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and rice (<italic>Oryza sativa </italic>L.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Yu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported that Cd concentrations in grains of 43 rice cultivars ranged from 0 to 0.37 mg kg<sup>-1 </sup>under low Cd exposure (1.75 mg kg<sup>-1 </sup>soil), and ranged from 0.30 to 2.19 mg kg<sup>-1 </sup>under high Cd exposure (76.95 mg kg<sup>-1 </sup>soil). Additionally, the translocation of absorbed Cd from roots to shoots differs greatly among rice cultivars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It thus may be possible to breed new rice cultivars that accumulate low concentrations of Cd in grain but with greater simultaneous accumulation of Cd in the aerial parts for phytoextraction and soil remediation.</p><p>The development of a detailed rice molecular genetic map and DNA markers has made it easy to analyze quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for complex traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and the use of near-isogenic lines (NILs) is an effective method for characterizing QTLs in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. NILs have been used to characterize a number of QTLs for agronomic traits in rice, including heading date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], lodging resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and yield traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Rice QTLs have also been used to study phosphorus uptake under deficiency conditions. The results using NILs suggested that a QTL on chromosome 12 (<italic>Pup1</italic>) affects root growth and efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Genetic analysis of Cd accumulation has been reported in cereals. Penner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] identified two random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers linked to a gene responsible for cadmium uptake in durum wheat. QTLs that putatively determine Cd accumulation in brown rice have been mapped on chromosomes 3, 6, and 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, these rice QTLs show different effects under upland and flooded conditions, and the mechanism of their control over Cd accumulation is not clear.</p><p>Cd absorbed by roots is transported <italic>via </italic>both xylem and phloem in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Cd translocation from roots to shoots is driven by transpiration in leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In durum wheat, it is suggested that Cd accumulation in grains may occur <italic>via </italic>phloem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. High Cd accumulation levels in durum wheat grain may be partially due to the elevated translocation of Cd from leaves and stems to maturing grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Additionally, Cd concentrations in grains correlated with Cd concentrations in shoots during the vegetative phase, and with translocation from roots to shoots in bread and durum wheats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Cd accumulation in the edible parts is thus likely to be controlled by the general translocation properties of leaves, stems and roots <italic>via </italic>the xylem and phloem. Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] reported that Cd concentrations in rice grain positively correlate with Cd quantity accumulation in plant, Cd distribution ratios to aerial parts, and Cd distribution ratios from aerial parts to the grain. However, it is not yet clear how similar Cd translocation and accumulation are between rice and wheat.</p><p>Because control of Cd translocation and accumulation is likely to be partially controlled by the plants genetics, the Cd contents of grain and the aerial parts of rice may be manipulated to simultaneously improve food safety and Cd uptake for phytoextraction. In this study, Cd translocation and accumulation and their genetic control in aerial parts of rice were studied to provide a starting point for improving food safety and phytoextraction in Cd-contaminated soils.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Accumulation and translocation of Cd in "Nipponbare"</title><p>Cd contents were determined in the ears (i.e. rachis, rachis branch, glumes, lemma, palea, and brown rice), flag leaf blades (FB), flag leaf sheaths (FS), upper leaf blades (UB), upper leaf sheaths (US), lower leaf blades (LB), lower leaf sheaths (LS), and culms of <italic>Japonica </italic>rice cultivar "Nipponbare" (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

Total content at pre-heading (67 DAT) was 75% of that at maturity (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01).

LB showed the largest negative translocation from vegetation stage to pre-heading, compared with the other plant parts. From pre-heading to heading, Cd translocation from LB and LS, and uptake from paddy soil provided Cd to culms, UB, US, FB, and ears. Plant parts other than culms and FS, mainly LB and LS, provided Cd to culms and ears from heading to maturity. After maturity, Cd was translocated from leaves other than FB to culms, FB, and ears.</p></sec><sec><title>QTL for Cd concentrations in upper plant parts just before heading</title><p>Cd concentrations in upper plant parts (i.e. from flag leaf to second leaf) just before heading were 0.341 &#x000b1; 0.004 &#x003bc;g g<sup>-1 </sup>dry wt in "Nipponbare" and 0.375 &#x000b1; 0.015 &#x003bc;g g<sup>-1 </sup>dry wt in "Kasalath", and were significantly different (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05).

Cd was translocated from lower leaves to upper leaves, and then from upper leaves to culms and ears. Lower leaves had the highest Cd contents during the early growth stages, but by the fully-ripe stage contained almost no Cd. These results suggest that the lower leaf tissues are primary Cd storage organs during the vegetative stage. From heading to fully-ripe, Cd contents decreased in upper and lower leaves and increased in culms and ears. The eventual Cd contents of the ears depend on translocation from both upper and lower leaf blades and sheaths, and on accumulation in the culm. Cd accumulation in wheat grain is the product of translocation from leaves and stems into maturing grain. Cd is accumulated in actively growing leaves and stems during vegetative growth, and is transported into the maturing seed head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In rice, Cd contents in grain are determined by Cd already accumulated in leaves and stems before heading. Thus, Cd translocation from the vegetative to reproductive organs after heading is similar to what has been observed in bread and durum wheats.</p><p>Arao and Ae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] reported that "Nipponbare" and "Kasalath" had similar Cd uptake efficiencies in their roots, but different translocation efficiencies to shoots and grain. Upper plant parts in cv. "Kasalath" had higher Cd concentrations than "Nipponbare" just before heading (data not shown). This study detected two QTLs (<italic>qcd4-1 </italic>and <italic>qcd4-2</italic>) that increase Cd concentrations in upper plant parts just before heading associated with the "Kasalath" allele (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). <italic>qcd4-1 </italic>and <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>might be a part of the genetic factors which determine differences in Cd translocation from root to shoot between "Nipponbare" and "Kasalath".</p><p>NIL<italic>qcd4-2 </italic>had translocated Cd from paddy soil to the aerial plant parts by 35 days after heading, and increased total Cd accumulation in the aerial plant parts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>might be involved in Cd uptake in roots, either directly, or indirectly by affecting formation and functional maintenance of roots after heading. <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>did not increase Cd uptake after heading in the presence of <italic>qcd4-1</italic>, but the interaction between these QTLs increased total Cd accumulation in the aerial parts at 5 days after heading by higher Cd accumulation in culms and LS rather than just the upper plant part (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These observations indicate that total Cd contents in the aerial parts are determined by two factors, Cd accumulation in all parts of the plant before heading and Cd uptake in roots after heading. In this study, Nipponbare and NIL<italic>qcd4-1,2 </italic>showed decrease in total Cd contents in the aerial parts and outward translocation to paddy soil after heading in (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This outward translocation means the translocation to root or the leakage to paddy soil (containing dead and fallen leaves on ground surface). Cd may partly translocate from the aerial parts to root after heading in rice, like potassium retranslocation from shoot to root [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The determination of total Cd contents in the aerial parts also involves the leakage to root or paddy soil.</p><p>Cd translocation property greatly differed among <italic>qcd4-1</italic>, <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>and their interaction. From 5 to 35 days after heading, LB and LS were largest source of Cd, and ears and culms were the main sinks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>decreased Cd translocation out of UB and LB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The interaction between <italic>qcd4-1 </italic>and <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>made higher translocation from total leaves, compared with "Nipponbare". <italic>qcd4-</italic>2 would inhibit Cd translocation out of leaf blades, and the combination of <italic>qcd4-1 </italic>and <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>would activate Cd translocation from overall leaves. <italic>qcd4-1 </italic>and <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>increased Cd translocation to ears, and only <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>increased total translocation to ears and culms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These results suggest that the two QTLs have different Cd translocations from leaves to ears and culms, and that <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>has a stronger influence on translocation to the sink organ.</p><p>The higher Cd contents of NIL<italic>qcd4-1,2 </italic>brown rice might be caused by the increases in whole plant accumulation before heading and translocation from total leaves after heading through the interaction between <italic>qcd4-1 </italic>and <italic>qcd4-2</italic>, much like in bread and durum wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Neither <italic>qcd4-1 </italic>nor <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>increased accumulation in brown rice, but interaction of the two QTLs significantly increased Cd (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The agronomic measured traits of NIL<italic>qcd4-1,2</italic>, "Nipponbare" and the other NILs were about the same (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), but NIL<italic>qcd4-1,2 </italic>had higher total Cd accumulation at 5 days after heading than "Nipponbare" or the other NILs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In rice, it was reported that Cd grain concentration in rice grain was largely governed by the transport of Cd from shoot to grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Additionally, the high accumulation of Cd in durum wheat grain at maturity reflects redistribution of Cd <italic>via </italic>the phloem pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Therefore, the interaction between <italic>qcd4-1 </italic>and <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>may affect phloem-mediated translocation from leaves to brown rice after heading. NIL<italic>qcd4-2 </italic>showed higher Cd accumulation and translocation into ears after heading than "Nipponbare", but had same Cd concentration in brown rice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Ears consist of rachis, rachis branch, glumes, lemma, palea, and brown rice. These results suggested that <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>might increase Cd accumulation of ear components other than brown rice. QTLs that decrease Cd accumulation in the aerial organs have great potential in rice breeding for food safety, because Cd concentration in rice grain correlates with Cd accumulation in the aerial parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In this study, <italic>qcd11</italic>, which should decrease Cd accumulation in the aerial plant parts before heading due to the "Kasalath" allele, was not found to be effective. Ishikawa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] detected two QTL for low Cd concentration in brown rice on chromosome 3 and 8, these QTL might decrease Cd accumulation in the aerial organs.</p><p>Cdtranslocation and accumulation before and after heading were affected by the QTLs in both an organ- and developmental stage-specific manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). From the vegetative stage to heading, Cd translocates from roots to aerial parts and accumulates in culms and leaves, and that translocation is increased by the interaction between <italic>qcd4-1 </italic>and <italic>qcd4-2</italic>. This pathway determines Cd content in aerial parts before heading. Cd accumulates in leaves until heading, and then it translocates to the ears <italic>via </italic>the culms, accumulating partly in brown rice. In this scenario, the interaction between <italic>qcd4-1 </italic>and <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>increases translocation from leaves and thus accumulation in brown rice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). It was suggested that Cd accumulation in grain might be responsible for phloem-mediated Cd translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], therefore, this pathway might relate to Cd translocation to brown rice <italic>via </italic>phloem. An additional translocation and accumulation pathway translocates Cd from roots to culms and ears after heading. <italic>qcd4-2 </italic>apparently increases Cd translocation from roots to culms and ears through the second pathway after heading, resulting in greater Cd accumulation in aerial parts after heading (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In ears, then, Cd accumulation increases at the components other than brown rice, e.g. rachis, glumes, etc (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). This second pathway could affect Cd translocation from roots to shoots <italic>via </italic>xylem after hading without Cd translocation to brown rice. Harris and Taylor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] suggested that restricted root-to-shoot Cd translocation might limit Cd accumulation in durum wheat grains by directly controlling Cd translocation from root during grain filling, or by controlling shoot Cd pools that can be remobilized to the grain. The second pathway after heading may limit Cd accumulation in brown rice by inhibiting Cd remobilization. Based on these patterns, the Cd translocation after heading takes two pathways, from leaves to brown rice and from roots to aerial parts. This study suggests that the differences in Cd translocation and accumulation before and after heading in rice are varietal, and that examining Cd flow in cultivars other than "Nipponbare" and "Kasalath" could clarify the whole picture of Cd translocation pathways.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Patterns of Cd translocation and accumulation in plant parts before and after heading</bold>.

Statistical differences between "Nipponbare" and NILs were determined using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of Heading Date, Dry Matter Weights, and Yield Traits in NILs</title><p>To check other potential influences on the "Nipponbare" host due to chromosomal segments from "Kasalath", heading dates, dry matter weights, and yield traits were compared between "Nipponbare" and the NILs. At 5 and 35 days after heading, dried ears, FB, FS, UB, US, LB, LS, and culms were weighed, these sum were calculated as dry matter weight per tiller. The number of ears, grains per ear, and total weight of 1,000 rice grains (1,000-grain weight) were determined as yield traits from nine plants in each line. Statistical analysis of the differences between "Nipponbare" and the NILs was performed using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TK and KI designed the study and wrote most of the paper, and TK carried out most of the experimental works. KS carried out Cd measurement of brown rice. NH participated in QTL analysis and the phenotypic evaluation of NIL. All authors contributed to the manuscript preparation, and approved its final version.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was partially supported by a grant from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (Development of DNA Marker-aided Selection Technology for Plants and Animals).
