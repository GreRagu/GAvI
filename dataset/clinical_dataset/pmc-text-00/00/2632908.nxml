To optimize tTA expression levels, several promoters for driving tTA expression were tested, and the weakest human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter showed the best induction/background ratio. Culturing yeast cells in different doses of doxycycline (Dox) resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of 3rd protein expression. Screening a cDNA library with pBT successfully identified functional Y3H interactions that could be easily discriminated from Y2H interactions by culturing on Dox-containing plates. At 5.0 &#x003bc;g/ml Dox, Y3H interactions were undetectable by the colony-forming assay under high-stringency selection conditions or by a lacZ colorimetric assay. A low-copy-number version of the pBT vector, pBT(L), completely eliminated the leakage activity of pBT found under low-stringency condition. In conclusion, the pBT system is a useful tool for studying the structures of higher-order protein complexes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system is a powerful tool for detecting protein interactions. It has been widely used to identify novel protein interactions and to analyze cell signaling networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The Y2H system is usually used for assessing direct interactions between two partners, despite the fact that most native protein complexes are formed by more than two proteins. Even in the case of two-protein interactions, a 3rd protein is often required to stabilize or facilitate the binding between the two partners. To study this kind of higher-order protein complex, a yeast three-hybrid (Y3H) system was developed. In this Y3H system, a 3rd protein is expressed together with a DNA-binding domain (BD)-bait fusion protein and a transcription activating domain (AD)-prey fusion protein. The 3rd protein is incorporated into the protein interaction between bait and prey through direct binding or protein modifications such as phosphorylation. If the bait and prey&#x02014;which do not form a complex by themselves&#x02014;can interact with the addition of a 3rd protein, the reporter genes will be activated.</p><p>Several Y3H systems have been developed thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5">2&#x02013;5</xref>). From a practical point of view, the use of an inducible promoter for driving the 3rd protein makes it easy to isolate triplex interactions from duplexes formed only by bait and prey. The Met25 promoter has been used for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), and several other inducible promoters can be used as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>). However, these promoters utilize inducing reagents that may affect cell metabolism and possibly cause unwanted phenotypes. For example, methionine depletion for the Met25 promoter hampers basal growth of the AH109 strain (unpublished data). To circumvent this problem, a tetracycline (Tet)-regulated expression system was chosen. Originally reported in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), Tet-regulated gene expression systems can also be used in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). Doxycycline (Dox), an inducing reagent of the Tet-regulation system, has no obvious effect on the phenotype and global gene expression pattern of yeast even at a high dose of 40 &#x003bc;g/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>In this article, the construction of a novel Y3H vector pBT is reported, which has all the Tet-OFF components within a single plasmid with optimizations to minimize background leakage activity. This pBT vector has been successfully used to isolate functional triplexes from a cDNA library. This simple-to-use pBT Y3H system will facilitate the high-throughput analysis of higher-order protein complexes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Suppliers</title><p>Yeast strains (AH109, Y187), yeast vectors (pBridge, pACT2), the mouse brain cDNA library in pACT2, Tet-OFF system vectors (pTet-OFF, pTRE) and pEGFP-N1 were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA, USA). pCI-neo was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA), and pTEF1/Zeo was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). p415CYC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) was from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). pCH110 was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain XL2-blue was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA). HRP-conjugated anti-Flag M2 antibody was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). SuperSignal Femto chemiluminescent substrate was from Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA). All other reagents were from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>pBridge was used as a backbone for all vectors. pBP constitutive promoter vectors were constructed by replacing the pBridge Met25 promoter with one of the exogenous mammalian or yeast promoters as described below. The CMV promoter (pCI-neo BglII&#x02013;HindIII fragment), SV40 promoter (pCI-neo KpnI&#x02013;HindIII fragment), HSV-tk promoter [pMC1neo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) XhoI&#x02013;PstI fragment], EF1a promoter [pEF-BOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) EcoRI&#x02013;BamHI fragment] and CYC1 promoter [p415CYC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) SacI&#x02013;XbaI fragment] were isolated by restriction enzyme digestion. The TEF1 promoter was isolated from pTEF1/Zeo by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primers: 5&#x02032;-GTCGCTAGCCAGCCCACACACCATAGCTTC-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-TTCCATATGGCCCATCCGCCCCTTAGATTA-3&#x02032;. The isolated promoter fragments were digested with NheI/NdeI, and subcloned into pBridge in place of the Met25 promoter. For pBT three-hybrid vectors, the Tet-regulated expression cassette was constructed by fusing the Tet operator (TetO) with a minimal CYC1 promoter (minCYC1) and CYC1 terminator (CYC1Term). Seven TetO repeats (TetO[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]) were amplified from pTRE by PCR using the primers 5&#x02032;-GCTGAGCTCTGTACGGGCCAGATATACGCG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GCTCATATGGACCCGGGTACCGACCTCGAC-3&#x02032;. The single TetO element (TetO[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]) was created by annealing two oligonucleotides 5&#x02032;-TATGTTTACCACTCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGAAAAGTGAAAGTCGAG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-TACTCGACTTTCACTTTTCTCTATCACTGATAGGGAGTGGTAAACA-3&#x02032;. minCYC1-CYC1term was isolated as a NdeI&#x02013;KpnI fragment from p415CYC1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The TetO[n]-minCYC1 promoter-CYC1Term cassette was inserted into the PmaCI site of pBP. The Tet transactivator (tTA) was amplified from pTet-OFF using the primers 5&#x02032;-ACTCGGCCGATGTCTAGATTAGATAAAAG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GTCTGGATCCTCGCGCCCCCTACCCACCG-3&#x02032; and subcloned into the NotI-BglII site of pBP. pBT(L), a low-copy-number version of pBT, was constructed by replacing the original 2 &#x003bc;m replication origin with a centromeric CEN6/ARSH4 sequence from p415CYC1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). For reporter assays, full coding regions of EGFP (AA 1 &#x02013; 239) and lacZ (AA 1 &#x02013; 1085) were isolated from pEGFP-N1 and pCH110, respectively, and N-terminally tagged with Flag tag (MDYKDDDDK-) using PCR. For Y2H and Y3H assays, a C-terminal fragment of mouse epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, AA 671 &#x02013; 1210) and the full coding region of rat growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2, AA 1 &#x02013; 217) were isolated using RT-PCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Strains</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains AH109 (MATa, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200, gal4&#x00394;, gal80&#x00394;, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, URA3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ, MEL1) and Y187 (MAT&#x003b1;, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4&#x00394;, gal80&#x00394;, met-, URA3::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZ, MEL1) were used to test promoter activity and three-hybrid interaction.

An excess of tTA expression will cause significant leakage activity under the OFF condition (in the presence of Dox). To simultaneously achieve sufficient inducibility and decreased leakage, it is critical to maintain an adequate but not an excessive tTA expression level. To identify the best promoter for tTA expression, the activities of several constitutive mammalian, viral and yeast promoters were compared, with the expectation that these mammalian and viral promoters may also be active in yeast, as was found in the case of the CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). TEF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and CYC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) promoters from yeast, the EF1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) promoter from humans and the CMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), SV40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and HSV-tk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) promoters from mammalian viruses were chosen.

Quantitative measurements showed that the TEF1 and CYC1 yeast promoters were more than 10 times as active as the mammalian promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Among the mammalian promoters, the SV40 promoter was the most potent, and the weakest CMV promoter had only one-tenth the activity of the SV40 promoter. The activity of HSV-tk and EF1a promoters was between those of the CMV and SV40 promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The CYC1 (strong), SV40 (medium) and CMV (weak) promoters were chosen for further evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Tet-regulated gene expression in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></title><p>To establish the Tet-mediated regulation system, the pBT vector was constructed by inserting the tTA gene downstream of the CYC1, SV40 or CMV promoter, respectively, and added a TRE-driven expression unit between the GAL4-BD and tTA expression units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The Tet-responsive promoter was composed of 0, 1 or 7 repeats of the Tet operator (TetO) motif fused to a minimal CYC1 (minCYC) promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). To characterize the pBT vector system, FlagEGFP or a lacZ reporter gene was inserted downstream of the Tet-responsive promoter. LacZ induction values from the TetO[0]-minCYC promoter was close to the background level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), indicating that the minCYC promoter by itself has minimal promoter activity. The TetO[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] or TetO[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] motifs induced high levels of reporter gene expression. In the absence of Dox, the CMV, SV40 and CYC1-tTA constructs showed a difference of only &#x0223c;1.5-fold in the lacZ reporter expression level in spite of the 100-fold difference in promoter potency. This indicates that very low levels of tTA expression were sufficient to achieve a nearly maximal TetO-minCYC promoter induction. Seven repeats of the TetO motif showed an increase in potency of &#x0223c;45% compared to a single TetO motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). In the presence of 1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml Dox, a marked reduction of reporter gene expression was observed, but a low level of leakage activity remained in all constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C). In this condition, seven TetO motifs caused an increase in leakage activity of &#x0223c;160% over a single TetO motif construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Significant leakage activity was also observed in EGFP fluorescence, especially in SV40 and CYC1-tTA constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). In the control pBP-X-CYC1 constructs that do not have tTA or TRE elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), 1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml Dox did not cause any significant changes in reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C). Taken together, the combination of tTA under a weak CMV promoter and TRE with a single TetO motif could achieve sufficient reporter gene induction with minimal leakage activity. The pBT-[bait]-TetO[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]-[3rd protein]-CMV-tTA construct was used for further analysis.<fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Tet-mediated regulation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

Of these, 31 colonies confirmed activation of the HIS3, ADE2 and X-gal reporter genes in the absence of Dox and 10 of them showed significant reductions of reporter gene activity in the presence of Dox. Among the Dox-irresponsive group, Grb2, Src homology 2 domain containing transforming protein 1 (SHC1), activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 (Ack1) and Crk fragments were found. These proteins are known to interact directly with the EGFR C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26 B27 B28 B29">26&#x02013;29</xref>). In the Dox-responsive group, son of sevenless homolog 1 and 2 (Sos1 and Sos2), modifier of cell adhesion protein (MOCA) and dynamin were found. These proteins are known to bind directly with Grb2 and interact with EGFR indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). No known direct interactor of EGFR was included in the Dox-responsive group. A control study confirmed that the Sos1 prey caused reporter gene activation only when the EGFRc bait and Grb2 coexisted, showing a functional Y3H interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Reporter gene activation through EGFRc-Grb2-Sos1 Y3H interaction was suppressed in a Dox dose-dependent manner in pBT, in contrast to the Dox-independent constitutive interaction in pBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Quantitative measurements of lacZ reporter activity also showed that EGFRc-Grb2-Sos1 Y3H interaction is under the control of the Tet-mediated regulation in the pBT system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, filled circle). Half-maximum reporter activation was observed at &#x0223c;1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), where the 3rd protein expression should be &#x0003c;5% of the initial level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). This means that there may be an excess of the 3rd protein at 0.0 &#x003bc;g/ml Dox. Reducing the expression level of 3rd protein to a half or one-third may induce sufficient Y3H reporter activation with improved signal-to-background ratio. To test this hypothesis, a low-copy-number version vector, pBT(L), was constructed for reduced protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Under a low-stringent condition selected only by HIS3 in the presence of 2.0 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT), the pBT construct showed significant reporter activation even at 10.0 &#x003bc;g/ml Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, top row). In the pBT(L) construct, reporter activation was completely suppressed at a dose of &#x0223c;1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml Dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, bottom row). This result indicates that the optimization of the tTA/3rd protein expression level raises the signal-to-background ratio of the Y3H assay.<fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Y2H and Y3H interactions using the pBT vector.

Previously established Y3H systems utilize a constitutive promoter (2,4) or an inducible Met25 promoter (3,5) for driving 3rd protein expression. Constitutive promoter system requires plasmid isolation and retransformation to confirm the three-hybrid interaction, which makes its application to large-scale screening difficult. The Met25 promoter system could regulate three-hybrid formation by controlling methionine in the medium. However, significant colony formation was observed under a restrictive condition (in the presence of 1 mM methionine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), indicating leakage activity of the Met25 promoter. It was also found that methionine depletion severely hampered the growth of the commonly used AH109 yeast strain (unpublished data). To overcome these limitations, the pBT system utilizes Tet-mediated gene regulation for driving the 3rd protein, thus enabling the control of Y3H interaction without affecting cell metabolism by adding or removing Dox. This feature makes the Y3H screening more efficient since the Y3H interaction can be easily distinguished from the background Y2H interaction by a simple colony duplication onto Dox(&#x02013;) and Dox(+) plates, as described in this article.</p><p>One advantage of pBT is that it contains the GAL4BD-bait, tTA and 3rd protein within a single vector, which means that it is fully compatible with any existing GAL4AD-prey libraries such as the pACT2 cDNA library used in this study. Investigators who have already utilized the GAL4 Y2H system can easily upgrade their screening to a Y3H mode by simply replacing their bait vector with pBT.</p><p>In the course of vector development, the optimization of protein expression level was found critical to achieve high sensitivity and specificity. Using a weak CMV promoter for tTA expression helped to minimize background leakage expression of the TRE-driven gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Reducing plasmid copy number suppressed background Y3H interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Although the low-copy-number vector pBT(L) was the best in the case of EGFR-Grb2-Sos1 Y3H interaction, it may also cause reduced bait expression and lowered sensitivity for the detection of weaker protein interactions. The high-copy-number pBT should be chosen in such cases. Users can select the appropriate Y3H vector with the best sensitivity and specificity depending on the nature of the protein interaction of interest.</p><p>The pBT system would be useful not only for studying higher-order protein complexes but also for isolating protein fragments or peptides that inhibit specific protein interactions. Reverse Y2H systems have been developed to study the dissociation of binding partners induced by mutations in protein sequence or by addition of exogenous reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34">32&#x02013;34</xref>). The Y3H system could monitor protein dissociation induced by a 3rd protein or peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). These principles are applicable to the pBT system. The tightly regulated pBT system has the advantage of being able to eliminate possible false positives in isolating protein interaction inhibitors, and has potential as a tool for biological research or for identifying therapeutic agents.</p><p>Further improvements of the pBT system are possible. For example, using the Tet-ON system will be useful in some cases. Although a simple replacement of tTA with reverse Tet transactivator (rtTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) did not work because of its high leakage activity (data not shown), using improved rtTA2<sup>s</sup>-M2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and Tet-repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) may help to reduce the background. An improved Tet-responsive element (TREmod) with tighter regulation may also be useful.</p><p>In summary, a simple-to-use Tet-regulated pBT Y3H system was developed and successfully used to detect native triplex formation. This pBT system will be useful for studying the nature of protein interaction networks and for isolating proteins or peptides that inhibit specific protein interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The Uehara Memorial Foundation and the Brain Science Foundation.
