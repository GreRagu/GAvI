This process is mediated by proangiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inducing proliferation, migration and tube formation of endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Another important feature is the interaction of endothelial cells with surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) that is mediated by integrins. Integrins are transmembrane receptors composed of two subunits binding to ECM and base membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Integrin binding mediates adhesion to surrounding structures and regulates cell survival, growth and mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Of more than 20 known &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; heterodimers the integrins &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;5 are predominantly expressed in proangiogenic endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A variety of blocking agents and antibodies targeting either one or both integrins has been developed for antiangiogenic therapy. Cilengitide, a cyclic pentapeptide mimicking the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) binding site, was identified as a potent and selective integrin antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] inhibiting binding to ECM components of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;5 integrins. It was shown to inhibit VEGF and bFGF-induced migration and tube formation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Cilengitide inhibits proliferation and differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells playing an important role in neoangiogenesis in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In preclinical models, cilengitide was synergistic with radioimmunotherapy in breast cancer and orthotopic brain tumor models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Expression of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;5 integrins is not restricted to activated endothelial cells. Especially brain tumors are known to widely express these integrin family members in tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Labelled integrin antibodies have been used for tumor imaging in glioma models <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and cilengitide as well as other inhibitors have been successfully tested in preclinical models of glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. While failing in a large trial of pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], cilengitide has been shown to be active in malignant glioma given alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] or in combination with chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, additive activity of the combination of cilengitide with temozolomide was seen only in patients with methylated promotor of O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), so far known as a predicitve marker for temozolomide therapy.</p><p>Direct effects of integrin inhibition on brain tumors were suggested from antisense experiments in medulloblastoma cell lines where growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In vitro, cilengitide caused detachment of U87 and DAOY cells with consecutive apoptosis induction depending on the matrix used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, no further data on signaling effects of cilengitide either cell type have been shown so far. Therefore, the current study was performed to investigate the morphological and molecular mechanisms induced by cilengitide in endothelial and in glioma cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and Reagents</title><p>Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1), kind gift from Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, U.S.A., were grown in MCDB 131-medium (Gibco) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA, U.S.A.) and 1 &#x003bc;g/ml hydrocortisone (ICN), and maintained on uncoated dishes in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% air atmosphere in a humidified incubator at 37&#x000b0;C.

For experiments with temozolomide, control cells were treated with medium containing 4% FCS and DMSO at the equivalent concentration used for the temozolomide stock solution. Apoptosis was assessed after staining with FITC-labeled annexin-V and PI (BD Pharmingen) by flow cytometric analysis. Positive staining with FITC-labeled annexin-V reflects a shift of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer layer of the cytoplasmatic membrane, which occurs early in apoptosis. Annexin-V-positive and PI-negative cells were scored as early apoptotic cells. Cells labeled by annexin V and PI have been determined as late apoptotic.

After 24 h of starvation in serum-free medium HUVECs grown on uncoated dishes were treated with 20, 40 and 60 &#x003bc;g/ml cilengitide for 1 hour and the activation of signaling molecules was evaluated by Western blotting with phosphoprotein-specific antibodies.

In particular, the interaction between &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin and KDR is important for downstream signaling of both receptor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Given that cilengitide interacts with the extracellular domain of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3, and might thereby interfere with the association of KDR with &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin, we examined whether cilengitide also affects downstream components of KDR signaling pathways. Stimulation of PAE-KDR cells (porcine aortic endothelial cell line stably transfected with VEGFR-2/KDR) with VEGF induced phosphorylation of KDR, FAK and Erk. Simultaneous treatment of PAE-KDR cells with VEGF and cilengitide (1, 5 and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml) did not alter KDR activation when comparing to total KDR protein but inhibited phosphorylation of FAK (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C/D</xref>). Erk phosphorylation was decreased only at higher concentrations of cilengitide (50 &#x003bc;g/ml) after 10 minutes, which may be due to pathway crosstalk, since KDR activity was not inhibited under these conditions. These results suggest that cilengitide inhibits integrin-dependent signaling through FAK and Src while it does not influence VEGFR-2/KDR and its downstream pathways in endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Cilengitide inhibits phosphorylation of FAK, Src and Akt in glioma cells</title><p>We next studied the effect of cilengitide on integrin-mediated signaling pathways in the absence of VEGF in glioma cells.

In our experiments, we observed dose dependent cell rounding and detachment of endothelial cells in tissue culture with cells undergoing apoptosis upon loosing attachment. The morphological changes were accompanied by the loss of intercellular contacts and disorganization of cellular cytoskeleton. Signaling experiments revealed inhibition of integrin-dependent activation of FAK, Src and Akt in two endothelial cell lines, HUVEC and PAE-KDR cells. Cilengitide did not notably interact with KDR-phosphorylation or Erk activation downstream of KDR, although direct interactions between VEGF receptors and integrins have been reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

This compound induced detachment and was shown to induce apoptosis by direct activation of caspase-8.
