First, although anorexia nervosa in adolescent and young men from the community was transient, it was accompanied by significant psychiatric comorbidity, which also manifested in their co-twins. The pattern of common familial diathesis of anorexia nervosa and of affective and anxiety disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004402-Keel1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004402-Wade1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> as well as of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004402-Lilenfeld1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> has earlier been demonstrated only among females in the clinical samples. Interestingly, the co-twins of the male probands differed remarkably from those of female probands in the same twin cohort, whose co-twins were mainly healthy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004402-KeskiRahkonen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, which supports the hypothesis presented by Strober et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004402-Strober1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that in order to develop an eating disorder, men require a stronger genetic predisposition and/or more adverse environmental factors than women. Second, compared to young males from the general population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004402-Raevuori1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder were frequent in the co-twins, suggesting a common familial diathesis for anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder. Third, anorexia nervosa in young men was more common than suggested by previous reports. The most age comparable study was in the UK and based on the General Practice Database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004402-Currin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x0003b; it reported significantly lower incidence rates than our study (2.3 for 10&#x02013;19 y and 0.5 per 100 000 person years for 20&#x02013;39 y). Studies in Sweden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004402-Bulik1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, Canada <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004402-Woodside1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and the US <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004402-Hudson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> also reported lower life-time prevalence of DSM-IV anorexia nervosa in young men, but are not readily comparable to ours because of varying age of the participants (up to 67 y) at the time of assessment and thus potentially long retrospective recall. In contrast, the incidence of anorexia nervosa among women aged 10&#x02013;24y in our twin cohorts was 140 per 100 000 person years, which is approximately nine-fold compared to men (Dr. Keski-Rahkonen, personal communication). Finally, as previous studies suggest, we found that also in our study, every proband with anorexia nervosa had been premorbidly overweight.</p><p>According to our study, approximately 1 out of 400 boys suffer from anorexia nervosa by young adulthood. However, the illness in males is rarely encountered in clinical settings, perhaps due to short illness duration, treatment delay, and fear of social consequences of diagnosis. The higher than expected prevalence must be interpreted with caution, because of the limited number of cases of anorexia nervosa, and of wide confidence limits. However, it is liable that the sensitivity of our screen was sub-optimal&#x0003b; thus the prevalence of 0.24&#x00025; is more likely to be an underestimate than an overestimate of the true prevalence of anorexia nervosa in the male population. Most of the screen positive men in our sample had some eating problems, but not a diagnosable eating disorder. A couple of men who reported that they had an eating disorder actually suffered from other severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia. Surprisingly, we did not detect any cases of bulimia nervosa without previous anorexia nervosa.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to report psychiatric morbidity of the co-twins of the male probands with anorexia nervosa. Our findings of the intra-individual and intra-familial clustering of anorexia nervosa, affective disorders and symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder support the earlier findings of shared biological vulnerability for these disorders. However, the contrast in the mental health of co-twins of the female <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004402-KeskiRahkonen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> <italic>versus</italic> male probands in our sample also suggests that in the general population, men who develop anorexia nervosa may exhibit stronger vulnerability for the illness compared to women. In addition, at least in a speculative level, these findings suggest that in men, the underlying vulnerability might manifest either as an eating disorder or as (symptoms of) body dysmorphic disorder, e.g. muscle dissatisfaction and muscle building substance use. However, because of a small number of cases and the co-twins, we suggest caution when interpreting these findings.</p><p>The strengths of our study include assessment at the end of the peak age of risk, good population coverage, excellent participation, interviews by eating disorder experts and co-twin controls. Limitations include small number of detected cases, self-report bias and recall bias&#x0003b; both at screening and at the diagnostic interview, self-reported figures of weight and height might have been biased due to the potential delicate nature of these measures among individuals with eating problems. In addition, less than perfect sensitivity of our screen may have resulted, had some participants concealed their eating disorders or other related problems due to the fear of stigmatization. Although difficult to overcome, we highly recommend that future studies specifically address this issue in their study designs in order to reach as many male probands as possible.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In our study, anorexia nervosa in boys and young men from the general population was more common, transient and accompanied by more substantial co-morbidity than previously thought. Co-twins of the probands displayed significant psychopathology such as male specific symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder, but none of them had had an eating disorder. Future studies should examine psychiatric morbidity of the first-degree relatives of males with anorexia nervosa in large, preferably population-based samples to replicate our findings in the co-twins.</p><p>All authors report no competing interests.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Elina Sihvola M.D. and Mikael Riska M.D. for help in conducting the interviews, and Eila Voipio R.N., Kauko Heikkil&#x000e4; Lic.
