This is important not only for the local repair but also for its beneficial effect to systemic physiological processes.

Understanding of the pathways induced by insulin is important for the development of analog molecules that function strictly in healing. Because of its long history of safe use in humans for decades, this protein may prove to be a powerful therapy without major adverse effects.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Wound healing is a complex process that involves sequential phases that overlap in time and space, interact, and affect each other dynamically both at the gene and protein levels. In addition, crosstalk between cells and the surrounding microenvironment contributes to the processes of clot formation, inflammation, granulation tissue development, and remodeling. Many different lines of experimental evidence have shown that the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms that result in these events involve cell adhesion/de-adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. One important process initiated during the early stages of healing is re-epithelialization; it involves the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of keratinocytes from the wound margins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Appropriate re-epithelialization requires not only the development of a continuous epidermal layer but also full epidermal differentiation and the formation of junctions between the epidermis and dermis. Because the epidermis provides a barrier against infection and maintains homeostasis, improving re-epithelialization, particularly in impaired healing situations, has attracted a great deal of attention. One molecule with the potential to enhance these processes is insulin, a hormone known to maintain the growth and development of different cell types. It can affect the proliferation, migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and ECM secretion by keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The use of insulin for non-diabetic purposes was popular in the early part of the 20th century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], was "forgotten" during the 40's and 50's, and it became again reinvigorated during the latter half of the century. For example, daily injections of insulin were used to improve bone healing in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], incision wounds of the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], healing in the distal limb of horses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and in cutaneous ulcerations in diabetic and non-diabetic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Insulin was also used in the 60's to treat diabetic wounds in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and more recently, insulin spray has been successfully used to treat patients with diabetic ulcers. Furthermore, this hormone has been used to treat burns in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] with good success. In addition to the studies <italic>in vivo</italic>, experiments with cultured cells have shown that insulin increases the rate of growth of fibroblasts, cells that are critically involved in the development of the granulation tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], suggesting that insulin can function as a growth hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, despite the strong evidence that insulin stimulates healing and thereby decreases the time of wound closure, the underlying mechanisms of insulin-induced improved healing are far from understood.</p><p>Here we show that local application of insulin to excision wounds stimulates keratinocyte migration and differentiation, and that this is dependent on activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, followed by activation of Rac1, and that the integrin &#x003b1;3 and the ECM molecule laminin 332 (LN332), are critical. We also show that insulin stimulates a regenerative process in the wound tissue. Therefore, insulin may prove to be useful in the treatment of chronic wounds, dental/gum healing problems, and burns. These are important findings because issues of impaired healing and of lack of tissue regeneration have implications for numerous health- and financially-related problems in this country and elsewhere. The understanding of key elements of the signaling pathways induced by insulin during stimulation of healing can lead to the development of analogs that will function strictly in the healing process.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Topical application of insulin accelerates and improves the quality of healing</title><p>To study the effects of insulin on wound healing, 7 mm diameter excision wounds were performed on the back of C57BL/6J mice, and locally treated with 0.03 U of insulin. This dose of insulin was chosen because it significantly stimulated healing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) without affecting blood glucose levels (unpublished data). We analyzed the wound area throughout the healing process to monitor the time-dependent effects of insulin on healing, and found that in wounds treated with insulin the wound area was significantly decreased at several time points (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), as was the time to closure (control 10.25 &#x000b1; 1.26 d, insulin 8.9 &#x000b1; 0.32 d, P &#x0003c; 0.01). We found that insulin significantly decreased wound area by day 3 after injury. In order to elucidate the effects of insulin during this early stage of healing, we took skin samples from control and insulin-treated wounds, and compared the histological characteristics of these two wounds. At day 3, we found that in insulin-treated wounds the keratinocyte tongue was much longer than that in the control wounds, suggesting that insulin stimulates keratinocyte migration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). When we measured the extent of migration of the keratinocytes by determining the length of migration of the tongue from the margin of the wound to the tip of the migrating keratinocytes, we found that there was a significant increase in migration distance of the keratinocytes in insulin-treated wounds (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Furthermore, we also found that following wound closure, the epidermis of insulin-treated wounds is better defined and is characterized by an increased number of epidermal reticular ridges and dermal papilla that are not evident in the control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Insulin accelerates wound healing and improves the quality of re-epithelialization</bold>.

Although the effects of insulin on keratinocyte proliferation are well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], its effect on migration of these cells is not clear. To study the latter process, we used HaCaT keratinocytes in culture. Cells were plated in cloning rings and allowed to attach; the rings were removed after marking their positions and the cells were then treated with insulin. Migration distances from the initial edge of the cells to the new edge of the cells were measured at 24, 48, and 72 hr. At each time point, keratinocytes treated with insulin showed increased migration over the control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, B</xref>). To determine whether this effect is dose-dependent, we performed the migration assays with different doses of insulin. A concentration as low as 10<sup>-8 </sup>M insulin was able to increase keratinocyte migration, which was highly significant after 48 hr of treatment. However, concentrations ranging from 10<sup>-7 </sup>M to 10<sup>-5 </sup>M significantly enhanced keratinocyte migration by 24 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). To eliminate the possibility that this migration is dependent on proliferation, we treated the cells with mitomycin C, a potent DNA crosslinker and hence inhibitor of cell proliferation, in the presence or absence of insulin. Cells were pre-treated with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml of mitomycin C for 3 hrs and then exposed to 10<sup>-7 </sup>M insulin for 24 and 48 hrs. Although we observed that proliferation was halted, insulin-induced migration was not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), strongly suggesting that the two processes are independently regulated by this hormone.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Insulin stimulation of keratinocyte migration is time- and dose-dependent</bold>.

These transmembrane proteins are both tyrosine kinases, share 60% homology, and activate a number of insulin receptor substrates which then initiate signals that lead to gene expression. These genes are involved in many of the different effects of insulin on cells and ECM molecules, as well as their receptors such as integrins, which provide critical signals to guide cell movement. To determine whether insulin-induced keratinocyte migration is dependent on one or both receptors, each group of cells was pre-treated with either the neutralizing insulin receptor Ab, 29B4, or the IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, picropodophyllin and then treated with 10<sup>-7 </sup>M or 10<sup>-6 </sup>M insulin. Pre-treatment of keratinocytes with the insulin receptor Ab followed by 10<sup>-7 </sup>M insulin treatment completely abolished insulin-induced migration, suggesting that at this concentration these effects are primarily mediated by the insulin receptor itself (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). When cells were treated with the insulin receptor Ab and 10<sup>-6 </sup>M insulin, the Ab only partially blocked insulin-induced migration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), suggesting that this concentration of insulin may induce migration through both the insulin and IGF receptors. To confirm these results, we pre-incubated the cells with picropodophyllin for 1 hr and then treated them with insulin. At 10<sup>-7 </sup>M, insulin-induced keratinocyte migration was not affected, but the inhibitor did decrease cell migration induced by 10<sup>-6 </sup>M insulin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Moreover, the keratinocyte migration resulting from 10<sup>-6 </sup>M insulin was abrogated when inhibiting both insulin and IGF receptors using the 29B4 Ab and picropodophyllin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Taken together, these data show that the effect of high concentration (10<sup>-6 </sup>M) of insulin on keratinocyte migration is mediated by both insulin and IGF-1 receptors, whereas the effect of lower concentrations of insulin (10<sup>-7 </sup>M) is primarily mediated by the insulin receptor. To study the effects of insulin that are mediated only through the insulin receptor and its associated downstream signaling pathways, 10<sup>-7 </sup>M insulin was chosen for the subsequent studies except when otherwise indicated.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Insulin-induced keratinocyte migration is insulin receptor-dependent and EGFR-independent</bold>.

Neutralizing insulin receptor Ab inhibited 10<sup>-7 </sup>M but not 10<sup>-6 </sup>M insulin-induced cell migration, showing that the effect of 10<sup>-7 </sup>M insulin on keratinocytes is mediated primarily through the insulin receptor. <bold>(B) </bold>Cells were pre-treated with either 50 nM IGF-1 receptor inhibitor picropodophyllin, 1.5 &#x003bc;g neutralizing insulin receptor Ab 29B4, or insulin receptor Ab 29B4 plus picropodophyllin for 1 h, then treated with 10<sup>-7 </sup>M or 10<sup>-6 </sup>M insulin or left untreated for 24 h.

In order to exclude the potential autocrine effects of EGF secretion on insulin-induced keratinocyte migration, we treated the keratinocytes with AG1478, a selective inhibitor of EGF-R kinase, prior to treatment with insulin and measured migration distances at 24 and 48 h. This EGF-R inhibitor did not inhibit the effects of insulin on keratinocyte migration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), suggesting that this process does not require EGF or its receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>PI-3K and Akt mediate insulin-induced keratinocyte migration</title><p>In order to determine the signal transduction pathways in insulin-induced keratinocyte migration, we examined Akt phosphorylation/activation by immunoblot analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and found that the levels of phosphorylation of this signal transduction mediator increased after 5 min of insulin treatment, and remained elevated for at least 60 min (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). This effect was also dose-dependent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). To determine whether Akt phosphorylation/activation was involved in insulin-induced keratinocyte migration, we infected keratinocytes with recombinant adenovirus expressing the constitutively active mutant of Akt (Akt-CA) or the dominant-negative mutant of Akt (Akt-DN). Higher levels of p-Akt were found in the keratinocytes expressing Akt-CA even without insulin treatment when compared to cells expressing the Akt-DN (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). To determine whether Akt phosphorylation is important in keratinocyte migration, we used the scratch wound migration assay. This assay was used to avoid trypsinizing and re-plating the cells because the viral infected cells have decreased survival. We compared keratinocyte migration distances with or without insulin treatment, in cells expressing the Akt mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D, E</xref>). Uninfected cells and cells infected with the null vector and then treated with insulin as well as cells infected with the Akt-CA, with or without insulin treatment, displayed the longest migration distance.

Therefore, to determine whether insulin stimulation of keratinocyte migration is dependent on PI3K activity, we performed the migration assays in the presence of LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K.

Therefore, we tested the possibility that the PI3K-Akt pathway stimulates RhoA activation during insulin-induced keratinocyte migration. Using immunolabeling, we show that there was no significant difference in RhoA distribution shortly after insulin treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;C</xref>) nor did a change occur at least for 4 h. However, 3 min after insulin treatment, Rac1, another member of the RhoA family of GTPases, translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, indicating its activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). This redistribution effect was also seen after 5 min of insulin treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). In addition, plasma membrane ruffling was observed at the leading edge of migrating keratinocytes, with Rac-1 being present in the membrane of ruffles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>; arrow). To determine whether this translocation is consistent with the activation of Rac1, we performed Rac1 pull down assays, which can specifically pull down the active form of Rac, and found elevated levels of active Rac1 after insulin treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>). In order to confirm that Rac1 activation is important in insulin-induced keratinocyte migration, we transfected keratinocytes with plasmids containing mutant forms of Rac1, and then observed the effects of these mutants on insulin-stimulated cell migration. Keratinocytes were transfected with either the constitutively active form of Rac1 (V12, Rac1-CA), dominant-negative mutant Rac1 (N17, Rac1-DN), or wild type Rac1 (Rac1-WT). 24 h after transfection, scratch wounds were made in the cell cultures, and cell migration distances were measured in non-transfected and transfected cells. After treatment for 24 h, insulin stimulated migration in non-transfected cells, as well as in cells transfected with Rac1-CA or Rac1-WT. Cells transfected with Rac1-CA showed increased migration, even without insulin treatment. However, insulin-induced migration was eliminated in cells transfected with Rac1-DN (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>).

Immunoblot analysis showed an increase in the LN332 protein after insulin treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>). To determine whether these observations translate into changes in the migratory behavior of keratinocytes, we observed the effect of function-inhibiting Abs to integrin &#x003b1;3 and LN332 on insulin-induced keratinocyte migration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>). Cell migration was inhibited when integrin &#x003b1;3 or LN332 were blocked with these Abs, while basal migration remained virtually unaffected. The effects of these blocking antibodies were more obvious after 48 h of insulin treatment; at this time point, functional blocking of &#x003b1;3 and LN332 affected both basal and insulin-induced keratinocyte migration. Moreover, additional inhibition was observed when insulin treatment was accompanied by treatment with both integrin &#x003b1;3 and LN332 function-inhibiting Abs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that <italic>in vivo </italic>both &#x003b1;3 and LN332 are involved in insulin-induced acceleration of wound closure. To test this possibility, we applied the function-blocking Abs against both proteins to mouse excision wounds, and found that inhibition of LN332 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A, B</xref>) or integrin &#x003b1;3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C, D</xref>) resulted in delays in healing, primarily at early times after wounding. Histological examination shortly after wound closure showed that both inhibition of LN332 or integrin &#x003b1;3 resulted in a less mature epidermis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). When the antibodies to these two molecules were applied, no reticular ridges were seen, the basal cells were not well defined, the interactions of the epidermis with the dermis were less well defined, and appendages were not seen. Furthermore, staining for Collagen IV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>), a component of basement membrane, showed that in the wounds treated with the function-inhibiting Abs for LN332, the basement membrane was not well developed, and when treated with &#x003b1;3 integrin, the basement membrane was irregular containing many dense areas of Collagen IV deposition (compare with the staining for wounds treated with insulin alone). When we stained for keratin 10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>), a marker of keratinocyte differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the basal keratinocytes of the wounds treated with the inhibiting antibodies did not express keratin 10.

We used a variety of cell and molecular approaches to determine the effects of insulin on cutaneous wounds and have shown that insulin: (1) stimulates keratinocyte migration in a dose- and time-dependent manner; (2) acts in an insulin-receptor-dependent but EGF/EGF-R-independent manner; (3) stimulates keratinocyte migration through the PI3K-Akt-Rac1 pathway; (4) stimulates keratinocytes to produce integrin &#x003b1;3 and LN332, and cell migration <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>is dependent on these molecules. The ability of this hormone to stimulate a variety of cell functions important for wound healing in an insulin-receptor-dependent manner creates the ability to target processes that are dependent only on insulin. Conversely, the ability to stimulate both the insulin and IGF-1 receptors may broaden the applicability of insulin in different wound conditions, particularly when one receptor may be missing or dysfunctional (e.g. type II diabetes).</p><p>Understanding the processes by which insulin accelerates wound closure is important because it will provide insight into potential manipulation of the healing process using this hormone as well as the signaling molecules it activates. The results presented here show that stimulation of keratinocyte migration by insulin involves the PI3K-Akt pathway, and identifies Rac1, a small GTPase, as a molecule activated downstream of PI3K-Akt. Support for these conclusions includes the fact that these molecules are activated upon insulin stimulation, and inhibition of each molecule with specific inhibitors or dominant negative proteins prevents insulin-induced keratinocyte migration.</p><p>Rac1 is known to regulate actin assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and to stimulate formation of lamellipodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], thereby promoting cell movement in response to external signals from cytokines, growth factors and/or the ECM. Our results support insulin-induced Rac1 activation in keratinocytes, as shown by Rac1 translocation from the cytosol to the cell membrane, the formation of membrane ruffles upon insulin stimulation, and the increased levels of active Rac1 identified by the pull down assay. Moreover, we show that Rac1 activation is dependent on the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in keratinocyte migration. Two recent papers showed a strong activation of the PI3K pathway in the wound margin keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, epidermal growth factor (EGF) or heregulin (HRG) have been found to stimulate keratinocyte migration through PI3K/Akt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These results, coupled with our findings presented here, show that insulin can replace some well known growth factors in wound healing.</p><p>The effects of insulin on keratinocyte migration described above, led us to hypothesize that insulin-accelerated wound healing involves increased expression of the integrin &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1 in keratinocytes as well as an increase in the levels of LN332. The latter protein is a matrix molecule secreted by migrating keratinocytes at the leading edge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], where it mediates keratinocyte polarity and persistent migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. After wounding, quiescent epidermal keratinocytes are activated and express the integrins &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;4 and &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1, which mediate their migration on LN332 and facilitate the development of the BM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Our results show that insulin stimulates keratinocyte integrin &#x003b1;3 expression and LN332 deposition, and that inhibition of these proteins <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo </italic>inhibits insulin-induced keratinocyte migration and wound healing, strongly suggesting an important role for these molecules in insulin stimulation of healing. This is a particularly important finding, as the relationship between LN332 and migration has been controversial. Indeed, previous studies have implicated LN332 in promoting and inhibiting cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]; our results support a role for LN332 in promoting keratinocyte migration.</p><p>In addition to its effects on keratinocyte migration during wound healing, insulin also promotes attachment of the epidermis to the dermis, the appearance of a well-organized epidermis, increased numbers of skin appendages, and more dermal papilla and epidermal reticular ridges. We also found that inhibiting integrin &#x003b1;3 and LN332 resulted in lack of full epidermal differentiation (as shown by disorganization of the epidermis) and decreased formation of dermal papilla and epidermal reticular ridges.</p><p>Our results suggest that the direct application of insulin to chronic wounds may improve wound healing by compensating for a deficiency of insulin and/or IGF-1 in the injured area. Previous studies have shown that the IGF-1 level is decreased in both streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic and normal rat incision wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and we have also detected a decrease in insulin levels in rat scald wounds (unpublished data). This insulin and IGF-1 deficiency in the wound, along with our data showing that insulin can function through stimulation of both insulin and IGF-1 receptors, suggests that direct application of insulin to the wound area may improve healing through activation of both receptors. Indeed, it has been shown that topical application of insulin accelerates healing of infected cutaneous ulcerations in diabetic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], showing that insulin is promising for treatment of these types of wounds. However, it has also been shown that leptin-deficient obese/obese (ob/ob) diabetic mice have dysfunctional signaling during wound healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], suggesting that in these mice mediating the effect of insulin on wounds might be different from those in normal wounds or wounds in diabetic people.</p><p>When compared with other growth factors used to promote wound repair, insulin treatment is likely to be much less expensive, more readily available, and has already been approved by the FDA for human use. Moreover, a significant numbers of reports have described that treatment with growth factors, including most of the growth factors that have been used clinically, or increased expression of growth factor receptors, lead to carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In contrast, insulin is safe, as shown by its use for nearly a hundred years, hence it is likely safer than growth factor alternatives. When choosing a concentration of insulin for possible wound therapy, it is important to remember that, although the highest concentrations of insulin resulted in the greatest keratinocyte migration, such doses may alter blood glucose levels <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have shown that insulin interacts with its receptor and affects multiple aspects of keratinocyte behavior, including stimulation of cell motility, increased expression of the cell surface adhesion molecule integrin &#x003b1;3 and enhanced secretion of the ECM molecule LN332. Furthermore, these effects extend to the dermis where we observe a higher degree of tissue restoration than seen in the control. These results strongly suggest that insulin improves wound healing through an integrated effect not only on re-epithelialization but also on the underlying granulation tissue. Therefore, insulin treatment may prove to be a powerful therapy for the treatment of impaired wounds, especially given the fact that insulin has been used in humans for a century without serious adverse consequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was a gift from DKFZ (German cancer research center).
