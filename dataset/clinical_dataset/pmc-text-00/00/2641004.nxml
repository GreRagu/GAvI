One of the most common applications is to mine protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from PubMed abstracts. Currently, most tools in mining PPIs from literature are using co-occurrence-based approaches or rule-based approaches. Hybrid methods (frame-based approaches) by combining these two methods may have better performance in predicting PPIs. However, the predicted PPIs from these methods are rarely evaluated by known PPI databases and co-occurred terms in Gene Ontology (GO) database.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p> We here developed a web-based tool, PPI Finder, to mine human PPIs from PubMed abstracts based on their co-occurrences and interaction words, followed by evidences in human PPI databases and shared terms in GO database. Only 28&#x00025; of the co-occurred pairs in PubMed abstracts appeared in any of the commonly used human PPI databases (HPRD, BioGRID and BIND). On the other hand, of the known PPIs in HPRD, 69&#x00025; showed co-occurrences in the literature, and 65&#x00025; shared GO terms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>PPI Finder provides a useful tool for biologists to uncover potential novel PPIs.

Therefore, knowledge-based methods such as text mining techniques to discover hidden and updated knowledge from the unstructured free text are in great need <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Ananiadou1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Krallinger1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the most important applications is mining correlations or associations such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Zhou1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Blaschke2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Plenty of PPI text mining approaches have been categorized into two groups, one is statistical calculation of the co-occurrence of genes or proteins, and the other is the computational linguistic method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Blaschke1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Zhou1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Statistical methods are based on the hypothesis that if two genes or proteins appeared in the same sentences, paragraphs or articles frequently, there may exist certain kind of biologically meaningful relation between them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Blaschke1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the relations between genes or proteins could be uncovered by calculating their co-occurrence frequencies. In general, the higher the frequencies are, the more likely the interactions are. On the other hand, computational linguistic methods employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the semantic meanings of relations (e.g. interaction) between genes or proteins. It first identifies gene or protein names in the sentences. Then it parses the sentences by employing the part-of-speech (POS) tagging. Based on the generated POS tags, a set of predefined protein-protein interaction patterns or rules are applied to extract the protein-protein interaction descriptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Zhou1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>However, the two approaches both have limitations. A drawback of the statistical methods is its inability to tell the exact relations of the genes in co-occurrence. The computational linguistic methods that use one sentence as a processing unit might miss the contextual information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Zhou1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, a hybrid approach by combining the two methods that is termed as a frame-based approach has been developed to have better performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Blaschke1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Biologists may have more interests in the predicted novel PPIs from these text-mining tools. It will be more straightforward to identify potential novel PPIs when the known PPIs are filtered in these algorithms. However, few algorithms have implemented this feature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Krallinger1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we developed a novel algorithm by a frame-based approach for a web-based tool, PPI Finder, which can not only find the related genes of the gene of interest based on their co-occurrence frequencies but also extract the semantic descriptions of interactions from the co-occurring literature by computational linguistic methods. In addition, we map the known interactions from the widely-used PPI databases to filter the known interactions. We also show the shared GO terms from the Gene Ontology database, in order to infer potential PPIs based on their functions in the same process or localization. This dedicated web server is helpful to the users to find both known and potential novel PPIs from literature.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Data Input</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Homo sapiens-related literature from PubMed:</title><p>The current version of PPI Finder only processes related literature in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> with a volume of 211, 119 PubMed abstracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-PubMed1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> indexed by gene2pubmed in NCBI Entrez Gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-NCBI1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> dated from 1950 to 2007, which is controlled by &#x0201c;species&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>&#x0201d;.

We evaluated them by using the following approaches.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Evaluate the co-occurrence by PPI Finder</title><p>We selected 29 genes from the HPSD database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Li1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, searched for them individually by using PPI Finder and returned 944 pairs of co-occurred genes (co-occurrence times &#x02265;1). We counted the PPI DB Evidence as positive when any of the three commonly-used human PPI databases (HPRD, BIND, BioGRID) shows interaction. The evaluation results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004554-t001">Table 1</xref>. The low positive rates of PPI DB Evidence (28&#x00025;) and expert validation (Expert, 33&#x00025;) of the co-occurred genes suggest the apparent limitations of the statistical methods when based on co-occurrence frequencies only. Similar lower precision rate (&#x0223c;40&#x00025;) was referred when applying co-occurrence-based method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Shatkay1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Co-occurrence implies that the genes might have a relation but not definitely the PPI relationship. For example, the interaction between a transcription factor and a target gene is often co-occurred in an abstract, but it is not collected in the PPI databases. Similarly, the members of a gene family or the proteins in a same pathway are usually co-occurred in an abstract, but they usually have no interactions. Thus, it is necessary to analyze the text with co-occurrence to see the details processed by computational linguistic method, suggesting the hybrid methods may have better performance. The result that positive rate of Expert (33&#x00025;) is higher than that of PPI DB Evidence (28&#x00025;) in the same dataset is probably due to the reason that some of the newly discovered PPIs may have not been expanded into the PPI databases yet.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0004554-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004554.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Co-occurrence Evaluation.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0004554-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0004554.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0004554-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Co-occurrence</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PPI DB Evidence</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GO Sharing</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Expert</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Positive/total</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28&#x00025; (266/944)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53&#x00025; (504/944)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33&#x00025; (311/944)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Negative/total</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72&#x00025; (678/944)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">47&#x00025; (440/944)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67&#x00025; (633/944)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>GO terms sharing provide information about the process, component and function of the co-occurred genes.

From <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004554-t002">Table 2</xref>, the positive rate of co-occurrence (69&#x00025;) suggests about two thirds of the known PPIs are shown in PubMed abstracts. The 31 pairs (31&#x00025;) that did not show co-occurrences in abstracts are mainly because of the applications of high throughput PPI discovery systems such as yeast two-hybrid, affinity chromatography and Mass Spectrometry. In most cases, the generated data by these techniques are collected in the PPI databases but not recorded in abstracts. Similarly, most of the negative GO sharing (a rate of 35&#x00025; in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004554-t002">Table 2</xref>) may be attributable to no assigned GO terms as these PPIs have not been proved by experimental methods and their functions are still unknown.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0004554-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004554.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>PPI Database Evidence Evaluation.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0004554-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0004554.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0004554-t002-2"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PPI DB Evidence</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Co-occurrence</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GO Sharing</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Expert</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Positive/total</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69&#x00025; (69/100)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65&#x00025; (65/100)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100&#x00025; (100/100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Negative/total</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31&#x00025; (31/100)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35&#x00025; (35/100)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0&#x00025; (0/100)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Based on this evaluation, we have calculated a confidence score to each item that does not show PPI database evidence in any of those three human PPI databases.

The co-occurrence showed a sensitivity of 92&#x00025; and a specificity of 100&#x00025;, which indicates that our methods of finding co-occurred genes are applicable to information extraction. The PPI database evidences showed a sensitivity of 86&#x00025; and a specificity of 100&#x00025;, indicating that most of the PPIs are correctly shown in the databases. The relatively lower sensitivity (66&#x00025;) and specificity (65&#x00025;) of GO sharing may be explained by lower stringency of GO term matches as described above, suggesting that it is not a strong indicator of PPI.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0004554-t003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004554.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Sensitivity Evaluation.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0004554-t003-3" xlink:href="pone.0004554.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0004554-t003-3"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Expert Positive</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Co-occurrence</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PPI DB Evidence</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GO Sharing</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">True positive/total</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">352/383</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">329/383</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">252/383</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">False negative/total</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31/383</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54/383</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">131/383</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sensitivity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">92&#x00025; (352/383)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">86&#x00025; (329/383)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66&#x00025; (252/383)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="pone-0004554-t004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004554.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Specificity Evaluation.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0004554-t004-4" xlink:href="pone.0004554.t004"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0004554-t004-4"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Expert Negative</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">co-occurrence</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PPI DB Evidence</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GO Sharing</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">False positive/total</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0/400</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0/400</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">140/400</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">True negtive/total</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">400/400</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">400/400</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">260/400</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Specificity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65&#x00025;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Taken together, the evaluation results reveal that PPI Finder's applications in PPI database evidence, GO sharing and extracted descriptions from co-occurred abstracts provide multiple tiers to assist biologists to infer the novel PPIs hidden in literature.</p><p>Comparing with the existing text mining systems (such as iHOP, PubGene, PIE) for discovering PPIs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Krallinger1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004554-Kim1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, PPI Finder has several unique features by adopting the hybrid methods with statistical and computational linguistic theories. These include (1) PPI Finder filters the known PPIs; (2) PPI Finder provides the information of shared GO terms; (3) PPI Finder is a search engine for interaction of any given pair of genes. Although we use the PubMed abstracts in this study, there is no limit to the length of an article when using PPI Finder. The full-length article may provide more information for text-mining, but the current freely accessed full-length papers are limited. One limitation of PPI Finder is that the data we used are offline. We need to update the backend databases whenever there are new data released from NCBI Entrez Gene or PubMed. Future versions of PPI Finder will be applied to other species such as mouse and fly.</p><p>In summary, we developed PPI Finder which uses a hybrid text mining approach combining statistical and computational linguistic methods. By using PPI Finder, biologists can search their genes of interest and may uncover some novel PPIs from published biomedical literature.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0004554-Ananiadou1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
