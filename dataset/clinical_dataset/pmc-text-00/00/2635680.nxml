However, polymer latex blends such as the combination of latexes, especially the latexes with water-soluble polymers, were rarely reported.

Two stages seeded semi-continuous emulsion polymerization were employed for constructing a core-shell structure with P(MMA-<italic>co</italic>-BA) component as the core and P(EHA-<italic>co</italic>-GMA) component as the shell. Results of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Dynamics Light Scattering (DLS) tests confirmed that the particles obtained are indeed possessing a desired core-shell structural character. Stable reactive latex blends were prepared by adding the latex with waterborne melamine-formaldehyde resin (MF) or urea-formaldehyde resin (UF). It was found that the glass transition temperature, the mechanical strength and the hygroscopic property of films cast from the latex blends present marked enhancements under higher thermal treatment temperature. It was revealed that the physical properties of chemically reactive latexes with core-shell structure could be altered via the change of crosslinking density both from the addition of crosslinkers and the thermal treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>core-shell morphology</kwd><kwd>latex/resin blends</kwd><kwd>waterborne melamine-formaldehyde resin</kwd><kwd>waterborne urea-formaldehyde resin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Since the idea of &#x0201c;particle design&#x0201d; was put forward by Okubo in 1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-3-342">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-9-3-342">5</xref>], where the control of micro-phase separated structure of latex particles via controlling the distribution of hetero-functional groups in their internal particles or on their surface were the main focus, various latex particles with different morphology, such as double or multi-layers structures, were obtained via specially macromolecular designing and emulsion polymerization techniques. It was found that the composite latexes were also possessing distinguished physical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-9-3-342">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijms-9-3-342">8</xref>]. Therefore, the &#x0201c;particle design&#x0201d; as a novel technology in the field of micro-composite science attracted extensive attentions and achieved many important applications in coatings, adhesives, plastics and biomedicine fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-9-3-342">9</xref>].</p><p>The physical properties of latex polymer film, such as Young&#x02019;s modulus, tensile strength, elongation at break and solvent resistance, are very important criteria to determine its practical applications. These physical properties are closely depending on the macromolecular structure, the molecular weight, molecular inter- and intra- chemical crosslinking network structure, the size and morphology of the latex particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-3-342">10</xref>]. The polyacrylate-based latexes are kinds of industrious latexes being widely used due to their excellent anti-oxidation, oil resistance properties. However, compared to the solvent based polymers, their physical properties including film&#x02019;s toughness, light fullness, water and solvent resistances are relatively weaker, and because of this, their practical utilizations are limited. In order to improve the actual performance of acrylate-based latexes, various kinds of techniques including soap-free emulsion polymerization, latex particle design with core-shell morphology and chemical modifications with silicon and fluorine related compounds are intensively developed. Particularly, there were not only a lot of research works concerning the syntheses and characterizations of the latexes with core-shell structures, but also there exist many reports related to the blends of water soluble epoxy resin with acrylate based latexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-9-3-342">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-9-3-342">17</xref>]. In these studies, special functional groups such as epoxy, N-methoxy-acrylamide, hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were first chemically incorporated into the main chain of acrylic polymers that can provide reactive sites for crosslinking. And then, for functional latexes with hydroxyl groups, the amino resins or blocked isocyanates were often used as crosslinkers and for latexes with carboxyl groups, the polycarbodiimide, polyaziridine and polyoxazoline were usually used as crosslinkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-3-342">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-9-3-342">20</xref>]. It has been noticed that, at present, chemically reactive acrylate-based latexes containing a special core-shell structure cross-linked by waterborne melamine-formaldehyde resin are rarely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijms-9-3-342">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijms-9-3-342">22</xref>]. Therefore, in this work, a core-shell composite polymer latex, specially, with P(MMA-<italic>co</italic>-BA) as the core, and P(EHA-<italic>co</italic>-GMA) as the shell was synthesized. Stable reactive latex blends were prepared by adding the latex with waterborne melamine-formaldehyde resin (MF) or urea-formaldehyde resin (UF). It was found that MF resin and UF resin can indeed act as an effective crosslinker via reaction with the reactive groups in the shell of the latex particles. Several physical properties of the polymer films cast from the latex blends are marked improved under higher thermal treatment temperature. The paper also analyses the detailed network structure formed via the crosslinking reaction and its possible molecular interaction mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results|discussion"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><p>The chemical reactivity of latex during film formation can be affected greatly by the distribution of reactive groups in latex particles. Core-shell latex particles with reactive groups in the shell layer often provide latex with better reactivity. Two stages seeded semi-continuous emulsion polymerization were employed for constructing a core-shell morphology with hydroxyl and epoxy groups in the shell. A seeded latex was first prepared using special formulated monomers and surfactants as the core component, and then, the shell component consisting of designed monomers and other surfactants was added to the reaction system to produce the composite latex. In the polymerization stage of shell layer, reactive groups were introduced in the copolymer chains and crowded on the particle surface. In order to keep the stability of the polymerization, sodium bisulfite redox initiator system was used, and as a result, the emulsion polymerization can be carried out at a lower temperature of 60 &#x000b0;C. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-3-342">Figure 1</xref> shows the monomer conversion curves of the core and shell polymerization steps. It was found that the monomer feeding time should be lasted 40 minutes for core layer and 60 minutes for shell layer, respectively. For each emulsion polymerization step, the monomer conversion can reach over 96% in 60 minutes after completing the monomer addition. It was also found that prolonging the reaction time couldn&#x02019;t significantly raise the monomer conversion. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the polymerization can be accomplished in 60 minutes after finishing monomer addition.</p><p>The macromolecular structure of copolymers synthesized was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy. Typical FTIR spectra of the pure latex and latex blends are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-342">Figure 2</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-342">Figure 2 (a)</xref> presents the spectrum of the pure core-shell latex. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-342">Figure 2</xref>, the band at 1732.3 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is the absorption of C=O groups in acrylate polymer. In addition, the presence of epoxy groups is evidenced by the appearance of an absorption peak at 912.8 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, which indicates that GMA segments have been successfully incorporated into the copolymer&#x02019;s main chain via the second polymerization step.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-3-342">Figure 3</xref> presents the z-average diameter (<italic>D</italic><italic><sub>z</sub></italic>), polydisperse index (PDI) and their particle size distribution curves of the core and complete core-shell particles. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-3-342">Figure 3</xref>, we know that <italic>D</italic><italic><sub>z</sub></italic> of the core particle is about 101 nm and shows a narrow distribution. On the other hand, <italic>D</italic><italic><sub>z</sub></italic> of the core-shell particle is about 132 nm, and the increasing of PDI indicates that its distribution is relatively wide.</p><p>The core-shell structure of the latex particles can also be confirmed by a TEM photo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-3-342">Figure 4</xref>. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-3-342">Figure 4</xref>, the morphology of latex particles clearly demonstrates a desired micro-phase separated core-shell structure. The width of the shell layer is about 17 nm, which is consistent with the results of DLS measurement. And this suggests that the goal of our research for &#x0201c;particle design&#x0201d; is indeed fulfilled.</p><p>Due to the incorporation of chemically reactive groups into copolymer&#x02019;s main chain, the crosslinking reactions between latex particles and waterborne MF or UF resin in the continuous phase of the latex blends may inevitably take place during film formation process under higher temperature. In order to understand the crosslinking mechanism and their physical properties affected by the addition of MF or UF resin, films of latex blends were heated at different temperature, and their structure and properties were studied. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-342">Figure 2(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-342">Figure 2(c)</xref> show FTIR spectra of film AMF (blend of latex with MF resin) and AUF (blend of latex with UF resin) which were heated at 150 &#x000b0;C for 10 min, respectively. It was found that the absorption band of epoxy groups at 912.8 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> disappears indicating a relatively complete chemical crosslinking reaction between two components.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-3-342">Table 1</xref> shows the effect of thermal treatment on T<sub>g</sub> of polymer films. It was found that from <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-3-342">Table 1</xref>, the glass transition temperatures for both pure latex and its blends, AMF and AUF, increase with the heating temperature. This indicates that the increase in the temperature of thermal treatment may actually increase the crosslinking densities for both pure copolymer and its blends, in turn, effectively raises their T<sub>g</sub>s.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-3-342">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-9-3-342">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-3-342">7</xref> present the mechanical properties for copolymer&#x02019;s films cast from pure latex, AMF and AUF blends, respectively. It was found that the tensile strengths for films of pure latex and its blends increase following the increase in the thermal treatment temperature. However, their elongations at break decrease accordingly. On the other hand, the tensile strength for films of AMF and AUF present much higher values compared with the film of pure latex. The results may reveal that chemical reactions in the pure latex occured among the epoxy and hydroxyl groups, which results in formation of chemical crosslinking under the raising of the temperature. Furthermore, much more emical reactions in AMF and AUF blends may also be initiated among the epoxy and hydroxyl groups, and also, the amine and hydroxyl groups between latex particles and waterborne resins. As a result, it leads to a significant increase in the corsslinking densities of AMF and AUF films, and at the same time, enhances their crosslinking networkes.</p><p>This structure difference can also be reflected in copolymer&#x02019;s hydroscopicity property as showing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijms-9-3-342">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijms-9-3-342">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10-ijms-9-3-342">10</xref>. It is clear that the samples&#x02019; hydroscopicities decrease following increasing the thermal treatment temperature, however, the hydroscopicities for filmes of AUF and AMF blends present much lower values compared to the pure latex treated at the same temperature. The result still reveals a factor related to macromolecular network structure in polymer films. In general, the film formation process of polymer latex can be described in three stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijms-9-3-342">23</xref>]. First, water evaporates first from the surface of the latex, then the spherical particles move closer to each other and are deformed into hexagons, the interfacial tension between polymer and water/air causes gradual coalescence, at last, the observable boundaries among particles are deformed and disappear, the polymer chains of the particle surface interdiffuse each other, and a continuous film is finally formed. For AUF and AMF blends, certain amounts of MF or UF resin may deposit toward the interface of particles with the evaporation of water during film formation. These resin molecules can act as crosslinkers to link the latex particles with chemical bonds under higher temperature. The process can produce higher crosslinking densities in polymer films. The mechanical properties of films increase, and the film&#x02019;s hydroscopicities decrease. Therefore, it is understandable that the reduction of hydroscopicities for films of AUF and AMF blends reflects actually the fact that their higher crosslinking densities and relative perfect network structures can effectively prevent water from penetrating into polymer&#x02019;s matrix and enhance their water resistant property.</p><p>It was also found that pure core-shell latex presents good adhesion strength onto a glass surface. The peel strength increases with the increase in thermal treatment temperature up to about 120 &#x000b0;C and then decreases with the further increase of the temperature as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f11-ijms-9-3-342">Figure 11</xref>. The result may imply that the chemically reactive groups in the shell layer of core-shell latex particles can not only react among inter- and intra- macromolecules but also react with certain hydroxyl groups on the surface of a glass plate. Interestingly, AMF and AUF blends show little adhesion property even at a higher thermal treatment temperature. For AMF and AUF blends, most of the reactive groups on the surface of latex particles may quickly react with MF or UF resin, and there is little residual reactive groups in the film. As a result, the amount of chemical bonds between the film and glass plate were greatly reduced which decreases the adhesion strength.</p></sec><sec><title>3.

Conclusions</title><p>By using two steps seeded semi-continuous emulsion polymerization, polyacrylate based composite latexes with a core-shell morphology can be synthesized under the special formulated recipes at 60 &#x000b0;C. Stable reactive latex blends were prepared by adding the latex with waterborne melamine-formaldehyde resin (MF) or urea-formaldehyde resin (UF). The mechanical property, water resistance and glass transition temperature of the polymer films cast from the latex and its blends can be marked improved under higher thermal treatment temperature. The physical properties are subjected to the adjustment of the thermal treatment temperature due to the chemical reaction via the reactive groups incorporated for polymer and its main chain. The higher the thermal treatment temperature, the better physical properties for copolymers are achieved.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References and Notes</title><ref id="b1-ijms-9-3-342"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Matsumoto</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Okubo</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Imai</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Distribution of polymers in particles produced by new type seeded emulsion polymerization</article-title><source>Kobunshi Ronbunshu</source><year>1974</year><volume>31</volume><fpage>576</fpage><lpage>586</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="b2-ijms-9-3-342"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Matsumoto</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Okubo</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Shibao</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Formation mechanism of heterogeneous structure in particles produced by seeded emulsion polymerization</article-title><source>Kobunshi Ronbunshu</source><year>1976</year><volume>33</volume><fpage>575</fpage><lpage>583</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="b3-ijms-9-3-342"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Okube</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamada</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Matsumoto</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Estimation of morphology of composite polymer emulsion particles by the soap titration method</article-title><source>J.
