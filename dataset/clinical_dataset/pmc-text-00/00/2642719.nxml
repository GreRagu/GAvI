Gene transfer vectors derived from gamma-retroviruses target at high frequency genes involved in the control of growth, development and differentiation of the target cell, and may induce insertional tumors or pre-neoplastic clonal expansions in patients treated by gene therapy. The gene expression program of the target cell is apparently instrumental in directing gamma-retroviral integration, although the molecular basis of this phenomenon is poorly understood. We report a bioinformatic analysis of the distribution of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) flanking &#x0003e;4,000 integrated proviruses in human hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. We show that gamma-retroviral, but not lentiviral vectors, integrate in genomic regions enriched in cell-type specific subsets of TFBSs, independently from their relative position with respect to genes and transcription start sites. Analysis of sequences flanking the integration sites of Moloney leukemia virus (MLV)- and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived vectors carrying mutations in their long terminal repeats (LTRs), and of HIV vectors packaged with an MLV integrase, indicates that the MLV integrase and LTR enhancer are the viral determinants of the selection of TFBS-rich regions in the genome. This study identifies TFBSs as differential genomic determinants of retroviral target site selection in the human genome, and suggests that transcription factors binding the LTR enhancer may synergize with the integrase in tethering retroviral pre-integration complexes to transcriptionally active regulatory regions. Our data indicate that gamma-retroviruses and lentiviruses have evolved dramatically different strategies to interact with the host cell chromatin, and predict a higher risk in using gamma-retroviral vs. lentiviral vectors for human gene therapy applications.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Integration of viral cDNA into the host cell genome is an essential step in the retroviral life cycle.

The molecular mechanisms linking RV integration to gene expression programs are, however, poorly understood. To investigate the role of transcriptional regulatory networks in directing RV and LV integration, we evaluated the local abundance and arrangement of putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the genomic regions flanking (&#x0002b;/&#x02212;1,000 bp) MLV and HIV proviruses. We show that RV, but not LV vectors integrate preferentially in genomic regions flanked by specific subsets of TFBSs, independently from their location with respect to genes or TSSs. Hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis of TFBS motifs flanking integration sites of different MLV and HIV mutants showed that the MLV integrase and the MLV LTR enhancer have a causal role in directing proviral integration in TFBS-rich regions of the genome. Transcription factors binding LTR enhancers in the nucleus before integration might therefore synergize with the integrase in tethering retroviral PICs to enhancer-containing domains of transcriptionally active chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Retroviral vector integration sites in human hematopoietic cells</title><p>Human cord blood-derived CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> HSCs were transduced under cytokine stimulation with MLV-derived RV vectors carrying a wild-type LTR, a &#x00394;U3 (enhancer-less) LTR, or an LTR from the spleen focus-forming RV (SFFV), and HIV-derived LV vectors carrying a wild-type LTR, a &#x00394;U3 LTR or an LTR containing the MLV U3 enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004571-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

A core of four motifs (MA0056, MA0081, MA0026, MA0098) is strongly associated (AU&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;100) to all MLV vectors, independently from their LTR structure. Three of these motifs (MA0081, MA0026, MA0098) are bound to TFs belonging to the ETS family, and one (MA0056) to TFs of the Zn-finger C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> family. Interestingly, sequences flanking the integration sites of the enhancer-less LTR vector (&#x00394;U3-MLV) lack a set of 12 motifs common to MLV and SFFV sequences, and 5 motifs common to MLV sequences only.

Although the insertion of the MLV U3 region in the HIV LTR increased the absolute TFBS motif count around integration sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004571-g002">Figure 2</xref>), it was not sufficient to change the segregation of the MLV-HIV vector sequences in the cluster analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004571-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows that the MLV-HIV sequences share most of their motif profile with LV sequences, with the notable exception of one Zn-finger motif (MA0021) that is shared instead with the MLV and SFFV-MLV vectors.</p><p>The results of the cluster analysis were independently confirmed by a principal component analysis (PCA), a technique that identifies simultaneously all the existing correlations between samples and variables in multivariate data sets, and orders them according to their contribution to the total variance of the system. The PCA transforms a number of possibly correlated variables, i.e., TFBS motifs, into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables called principal components (PCs). A scatter plot of the first two components, accounting for 31.6&#x00025; of the total variability, identifies three main groups: RV sequences (MLV, SFFV-MLV and &#x00394;U3-MLV), LV sequences (HIV, &#x00394;U3-HIV&#x0005b;CMV&#x0005d;, &#x00394;U3-HIV&#x0005b;MLV&#x0005d;, and the hybrid MLV-HIV), and control sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004571-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The first component discriminates between RV and all other sequences, the second one between LV and control sequences, oriented in opposite direction along the second component axis (left panel). The variability within MLV and SFFV-MLV data is higher that in any other group, possibly because of the high number of TFBSs contained in those sequences. &#x00394;U3-MLV sequences contain a lower number of TFBSs and show a lower variability, although they are still oriented towards the RV group along the first component axis. The loading plot on the right panel shows a high number of motifs (represented as vectors) contributing to the RV group. Among the 19 loadings with a length higher than the chosen cutoff, one (MA0032) is oriented with the LV group, two (MA0117, MA0089) with the control group, and the remaining ones with the first principal component. Twelve of these vectors are exclusively oriented with the RV group, and belong to different TFBS families: four motifs are recognized by Zn-finger C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, three by ETS, two by homeodomain-containing, and one by Zn-finger-dof, HMG, and AP2 transcription factors. Interestingly, this group contains the four motifs strongly associated with RV sequences in the cluster analysis (MA0056, MA0081, MA0026, and MA0098 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004571-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

Gamma-retroviruses favor integrations near TSS and CpG islands, lentiviruses integrate preferentially within active transcription units, while alpha- and beta-retroviruses, such as the avian sarcoma-leukosis virus and the murine mammary tumor virus, appear to integrate randomly into their host cell genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Faschinger1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. These alternative preferences have a significant impact in predicting the risk of insertional gene activation of retroviral gene transfer vectors. It has recently been suggested that HIV-derived LV vectors, due to their different integration preferences and LTR enhancer-free design, could be associated to a lower genotoxic risk compared to conventional RV vectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Porteus1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Bushman3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Nienhuis1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Baum1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the current poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying retroviral target site selection is a serious obstacle in the rational design of safer and more efficient gene transfer technology. Understanding in more detail the interactions between retroviral PICs and the human genome, the viral and cellular determinants of target site selection, and the role of the functional vector components (enhancers, promoters, splicing and polyadenylation signals) in influencing integration and gene expression, is crucial to assess the genotoxic characteristics of different vector families and designs.</p><p>Our study identifies a previously unrecognized feature of the regions targeted by RV PICs, i.e., an elevated content of transcription factor binding sites. By analyzing the sequences flanking the integration sites of MLV- and HIV-derived vectors in human HSCs, and of mutants featuring deletions and replacements of the LTR U3 enhancers, we show that integration in TFBS-rich regions of the genome is a specific characteristic of an RV vector with an LTR containing an RV enhancer (either MLV- or SFFV-derived). Deletion of the U3 element eliminates the TFBS over-representation around the insertion sites and reduces the relative frequency of TSS-proximal integrations, indicating that the U3 enhancer is an important viral determinant of RV target site selection. A statistical analysis indicates that over-representation of TFBSs is independent from the relative position or distance of the integration sites with respect to transcription units. This suggests that selection of TFBS-rich regions may in fact underlie all known RV integration preferences, particularly that for TSSs, CpG islands and DNase-I hypersensitive sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Wu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Laufs1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Lewinski1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Recchia1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Cattoglio1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, where TFBS-rich regulatory regions are highly represented.</p><p>On the contrary, TFBS motifs are significantly under-represented around LV integration sites, independently from the presence of the HIV U3 element in the LTR. Replacement of the HIV with an MLV U3 element in an LV vector removes this negative bias, but is not sufficient to introduce a positive one like that of MLV-based vectors. Interestingly, when we analyzed the sequences around a previously published collection of integration sites of MLV, HIV, and an HIV vector packaged with an MLV integrase (HIVmIN) in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Lewinski1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, we discovered that the MLV integrase re-directs the integration of an HIV vector towards regions significantly enriched in TFBSs, again independently from intergenic, intragenic or TSS-proximal annotation of the integration site. Increased targeting of TFBS-rich regions might in turn underlie the increased targeting of TSSs, CpG islands and DNase-I hypersensitive sites previously observed for the HIVmIN vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Lewinski1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. We conclude that the MLV integrase and the LTR U3 region are the major viral determinants of the RV-specific selection of TFBS-rich target sites into the genome.</p><p>The MLV U3 enhancer contains repeated binding sites for a number of TFs, including members of the ETS, NFAT, C/EBP and nuclear hormone receptor families, the AML1/RUNX1-CBFB complex, and YY1. Bound transcription factors may very well be the cellular mediators of the LTR-associated component of RV integration preferences. Indeed, unintegrated retroviral genomes, possibly including PICs, are transcriptionally active in the target cell nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Lai1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Steinrigl1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, and are therefore likely to bind at least some of the TFs driving transcription of the integrated proviral genomes. We propose that TFs binding the U3 enhancer cooperate with the integrase in directing PICs towards regulatory regions actively engaged by the transcriptional machinery. Alternatively, unbound U3 elements in RV PICs engage chromatin-associated TFs to direct integration. Cooperation between TFs and the integrase may be seen as an evolution of the mechanisms by which yeast retrotransposons target their integration to specific genomic regions through tethering to host cell proteins. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a specific domain of the retrotransposase directs integration of the Ty3 retrotransposon to promoters transcribed by the DNA polymerase III, by tethering to Pol III-specific transcription factors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Bushman1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>). This domain is lacking in the RV integrases, which are otherwise related to retrotransposases, and may have been functionally replaced by the association with TFs bound to the LTR elements. As a result, RV PICs are able to target a large collection of Pol II-specific, rather than a few Pol III-specific, regulatory elements throughout the genome.</p><p>A comparison between the TFBS motifs associated to RV integration sites in HSCs and in the non-hematopoietic HeLa cells shows a statistically significant association of specific motif patterns to either cell type, together with motifs over-represented in both cells. The existence of cell-specific and non-specific TFBS clusters suggests that RV PICs interact with general components of the enhancer-binding complexes (e.g., co-regulators, chromatin remodeling or mediator complexes) rather than with specific TFs or TF families. Recent data indicate that the MLV integrase may interact directly with chromatin-remodeling, DNA repair and transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Studamire1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, providing independent, biochemical support to this hypothesis. Tethering of PICs to transcription factories, where promoters and regulatory regions are relocated by cell-specific mechanisms, may in turn be the cause of the RV-specific, high frequency of integration hot spots and preferred targeting of genes associated to cell-specific regulatory networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Recchia1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Cattoglio1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, TFBSs specifically associated with RV integration in HSCs include binding sites for HSC-specific regulators of cell proliferation, differentiation or quiescence, such as LMO2, AML1/RUNX1, and FOXO3. A mechanism coupling target site selection to gene regulation may have evolved to maximize the probability for gamma-retroviruses to be transcribed in the target cell genome, and possibly to induce expansion of infected cells by insertional activation of cell-specific growth regulators. Interestingly, integration of HIV does not favor, and possibly avoids, TFBS-rich regions, suggesting the evolution of a different mechanism that targets open chromatin regions while minimizing interference with the cell transcriptional machinery.

Although a self-inactivating (&#x00394;U3) design is predicted, also by this analysis, to improve the safety characteristics of MLV-based vectors, the activity of the MLV integrase remains an undesirable enhancer of the frequency by which an RV vector may target potentially dangerous regions of the genome. This study also shows the importance of the cell context in determining the frequency of integration into certain genomic regions, and predicts that targeting of dominantly acting proto-oncogenes may have a different likelihood in different cells.

An <italic>Mse</italic>I double-stranded linker was then ligated and LM-PCR performed with nested primers specific for the linker and the 3&#x02032; LTR (MLV: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;- GACTTGTGGTCTCGCTGTTCCTTGG-3&#x02032;</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;- GGTCTCCTCTGAGTGATTGACTACC-3&#x02032;</named-content>; HIV: <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;- AGTGCTTCAAGTAGTGTGTGCC-3&#x02032;</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;- GTCTGTTGTGTGACTCTGGTAAC-3&#x02032;</named-content>). PCR products were shotgun-cloned (TOPO TA cloning kit, Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) into libraries of integration junctions, which were then sequenced to saturation. A valid integration contained the MLV or HIV nested primer, the entire MLV or HIV genome up to a CA dinucleotide and the linker nested primer. Sequences between the 3&#x02032; LTR and the linker primers were mapped onto the human genome (UCSC Human Genome Project Working Draft, hg17) using Blat<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Kent1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> requiring a 98&#x00025; identity over the entire sequence length and selecting the best hit. The absolute genomic coordinates of the integration sites where defined as a result of the combination of genomic alignment and vector relative orientation data. Random genomic sequences originated by LM-PCR (genomic <italic>Mse</italic>I-<italic>Mse</italic>I, <italic>Pst</italic>I-<italic>Mse</italic>I, <italic>Nar</italic>I-<italic>Mse</italic>I or <italic>Sac</italic>I-<italic>Mse</italic>I fragments) were mapped by the same criteria, and used as experimental controls. All sequences were annotated as &#x0201c;TSS-proximal&#x0201d; when occurring at a distance of &#x000b1;5 kb from the TSS of any Known Gene (UCSC definition), &#x0201c;intragenic&#x0201d; when occurring within the transcribed portion of at least one Known Gene &#x0003e;5 kb from the TSS, and &#x0201c;intergenic&#x0201d; in all other cases. Whenever multiple transcript variants exist, the most represented and/or the longest isoform was chosen. Integration sites from published datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Wu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Lewinski1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> were re-mapped and annotated according to the same criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Analysis of transcription factor binding sites</title><p>TFBS analysis was carried out on genomic sequences encompassing each integration site with &#x000b1;1.0 kb of sequence length. Based on the TSS-proximal/intragenic/intergenic annotation of each integration site, we grouped datasets that do not significantly differ from each other (two-sided test on equal proportion) into seven groups of integration preferences, and generated the same number of random weighted control groups of sequences that reproduce, in proportion, the specific integration preference of each vector. Each fitted background was composed of 10,000 sequences of 2.0 kb in length derived from 100,000 randomly generated integration sites throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004571.s004">Table S1</xref>). TFBS enrichment analysis was carried out with the Clover program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Frith1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, with dinucleotide randomization. Motif <italic>p</italic>-value threshold was set to 0.05. TFBSs, described as positional-weight matrices, were obtained from the JASPAR Core 2005 database of experimentally validated motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Sandelin1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Each sequence set was paired with the appropriate weighted background. TFBSs having a global <italic>p</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.05 were considered as significantly enriched in the test sequences and selected for analysis. Motif frequency was defined as the number of motif per sequence significantly enriched in the Clover analysis, applying a one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test (alternative hypothesis: &#x0201c;greater&#x0201d;). Motif likelihood ratios, obtained by Clover, were used for cluster analysis and PCA. Analysis of conserved TFBSs was performed using the TFBS Conserved Track at UCSC Genome Browser, which includes binding sites conserved between the human and mouse or rat genome alignment (188 human matrices from the TRANSFAC Matrix Database v 7.0). After determination of the total count of matrices that match in each 2.0-kb test sequence, random and matched fitted backgrounds, a Fisher exact test (two-sided, confidence level&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.95) was used to determine statistical significance. The STAMP tool-kit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Mahony1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> was used to match JASPAR and TRANSFAC matrices using default parameters.</p><p>For the hierarchical clustering analysis, data were scaled on motifs columns before analysis. Column dendrograms were sampled with 10,000 bootstrap replicates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004571-Shimodaira1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Nodes having an Approximately Unbiased (AU) <italic>p</italic>-value&#x0003e;0.95 were scored as significant and stable nodes. PCA was computed on correlation matrix without factor rotation. For each bidimensional plane considered, only loadings having a value higher than cos(&#x003c0;/4)&#x0223c;0.707 were considered as relevant: since all vectors have a length&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 in poly-dimensional space, we only see their projection on the principal components plane, hence if the projection length is longer than 0.707 the angle between the vector and the plane is less than &#x003c0;/4 (45 degrees), meaning strong correlation between the vector and the plane.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using the R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics version 2.6.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>) and several contributed packages. Hierarchical clustering used the <italic>pvclust</italic> package; PCA alysis used <italic>ade4</italic>; parallel processing was implemented using the <italic>snow</italic> package.
