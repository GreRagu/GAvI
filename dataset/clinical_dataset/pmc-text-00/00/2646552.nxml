In lymphocytes, chemokine (e.g., SDF-1) stimulation inactivates ERM proteins, causing their release from the plasma membrane and dephosphorylation. SDF-1&#x02013;mediated inactivation of ERM proteins is blocked by phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitors. Conversely, reduction of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) levels by activation of PLC, expression of active PLC mutants, or acute targeting of phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase to the plasma membrane promotes release and dephosphorylation of moesin and ezrin. Although expression of phosphomimetic moesin (T558D) or ezrin (T567D) mutants enhances membrane association, activation of PLC still relocalizes them to the cytosol. Similarly, in vitro binding of ERM proteins to the cytoplasmic tail of CD44 is also dependent on PIP2. These results demonstrate a new role of PLCs in rapid cytoskeletal remodeling and an additional key role of PIP2 in ERM protein biology, namely hydrolysis-mediated ERM inactivation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins link the cortical cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. In their active conformation, the N-terminal FERM (protein 4.1 ERM) domain binds to the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane proteins, and the C-terminal ERM association domain (C-ERMAD) region binds to actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bretscher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fievet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes and Fehon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niggli and Rossy, 2008</xref>). However, ERMs also exist in a dormant or autoinhibited conformation in which the binding sites on the FERM domain are masked by the remainder of the molecule, including an &#x0223c;200-residue linker and the C-ERMAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pearson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Transition of ERM proteins to an active conformation (i.e., release of autoinhibition) occurs by two distinct mechanisms: (1) binding of the FERM domain to membrane rich in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and (2) phosphorylation of the C-ERMAD. After a decade of elegant in vitro and in vivo studies, a dominant current view is that activation occurs in a two-step fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bretscher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fievet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes and Fehon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niggli and Rossy, 2008</xref>). First, PIP2 binding induces a conformational change and partial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barret et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yonemura et al., 2002</xref>). Second, because that conformational change has made the phosphorylation site accessible, C-terminal phosphorylation can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fievet et al., 2004</xref>). When phosphorylated, ERM proteins are active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsui et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakamura et al., 1999</xref>). According to a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fievet et al., 2004</xref>), phosphorylated ERM (pERM) proteins are active without PIP2.</p><p>Although activation is the focus of studies of ERM protein regulation in most cells, ERM protein inactivation is also biologically important, particularly in cytoskeletal reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zeidan et al., 2008</xref>). Acute ERM protein inactivation plays a critical physiological role in lymphocytes. Lymphocyte recirculation from blood into tissue then back into blood is crucial for efficient immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laudanna and Alon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rose et al., 2007</xref>). While in blood, the cytoskeleton of the lymphocyte assures that it is spherical and relatively rigid, allowing it to survive the hemodynamic rigors of circulation. Regulated binding to vascular endothelium and migration into tissue are triggered by molecules termed chemokines on the endothelial surface that activate G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the lymphocyte. One very rapid consequence is global reorganization of cytoskeleton into a configuration appropriate for a flexible migration-capable cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2001</xref>). Because ERMs provide a conformationally regulated connection from the cortical actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bretscher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fievet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes and Fehon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niggli and Rossy, 2008</xref>), rapid conversion of ERMs from their active to inactive conformations plays a key role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivetic and Ridley, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Proteins of the PLC family are critical mediators of signal transduction, especially for GPCRs such as chemokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rhee, 2001</xref>). Proteins of this family are most widely known for their generation of two key mediators: a membrane-bound mediator, DAG, and a soluble mediator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, IP3, which play multiple functions in diversified pathways. Less frequently discussed is the functional impact of local reduction of PIP2 in the plasma membrane that results from PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2. Such changes in PIP2 have the potential to influence many molecules/processes such as ion channels and cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Janmey and Lindberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McLaughlin and Murray, 2005</xref>).</p><p>We investigated the potential involvement of PIP2 and PLC in chemokine-induced ERM protein inactivation in lymphocytes based on (a) the importance of PIP2 in the aforementioned ERM activation and (b) the role of PLC in GPCR signaling, generally and specifically in chemokine-induced T lymphocyte migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smit et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Soriano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cronshaw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bach et al., 2007</xref>). We find that chemokine-induced inactivation of lymphocyte ERM proteins (ezrin and moesin) is mediated by the reduction of PIP2 that results from PLC hydrolysis. Moreover, our experiments reveal a key additional element not reflected in the Fievet model of sequential activation: even when ERM proteins are phosphorylated, their function largely depends on membrane PIP2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Activation of PLC is essential for SDF-1&#x02013;induced ERM protein release from cortical membrane and dephosphorylation</title><p>We hypothesized that ERM protein inactivation might be one of the components of the migratory response that is dependent on PLC activation. The affect of PLC inhibitors on ERM protein inactivation was therefore assessed using two readouts: dephosphorylation of ERM proteins and their dissociation from the membrane. SDF-1&#x02013;induced ERM protein dephosphorylation is efficiently blocked in peripheral blood T cells (PBTs) pretreated with U73122 but not with U73433, the inactive analogue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Conversely, the PLC activator m-3M3FBS induces ERM protein dephosphorylation. In contrast, the PI3-K inhibitor Ly294002 does not inhibit ERM protein dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the Jurkat T cell line (unpublished data). Thus, PLC activation is necessary for SDF-1&#x02013;induced rapid ERM protein dephosphorylation and is sufficient to initiate ERM protein dephosphorylation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>SDF-1&#x02013;induced ERM protein dephosphorylation depends on PLC signaling.</bold> (A) Detection of ERM protein phosphorylation by WB in SDF-1&#x02013;stimulated PBT.

However, moesin and ezrin have also been reported to have some functional differences; e.g., in regulation of their localization in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ilani et al., 2007</xref>). Using PAGE conditions optimized for resolving ezrin and moesin, we find that both undergo SDF-1&#x02013;induced dephosphorylation and that dephosphorylation of both is sensitive to the PLC inhibitor U73122 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>).</p><p>Immunofluorescence microscopy of lymphocytes under these stimulation conditions indicated that ERM protein dissociation from membrane accompanies the dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). In untreated primary T lymphocytes, pERM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>, green) almost completely colocalize with the transmembrane molecule CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>, red) at the cell periphery. The staining of pERM is punctate (consistent with enrichment in microvilli) and strong. After the cells are stimulated with SDF-1, the CD44 remains in the membrane but is often polarized toward the uropod, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">del Pozo et al., 1995</xref>). pERM staining is weak (reflecting partial dephosphorylation), diffuse, and not well localized with CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>, magnification), indicating that pERM was released from its membrane association. The PLC inhibitor U73122 blocks the SDF-1&#x02013;induced cell polarization, the decrease in pERM staining, and the delocalization of pERM from the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). The inactive analogue U73433 and the PI3-K inhibitor do not block these processes. In addition, the PLC activator m-3M3FBS was tested to determine whether activation of PLC by itself will lead to ERM protein dephosphorylation and disassociation from the membrane. Indeed, treatment of PBTs with m-3M3FBS induced ERM protein dephosphorylation and disassociation from CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).

The most investigated aspects of PLC signaling are the second messengers DAG and IP3 (with its attendant Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux). However, PLC activation also reduces the PIP2 level that, we hypothesized, could mediate ERM protein inactivation. The GFP-tagged pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLC-&#x003b4; (GFP-PH) was used as a reporter for PIP2 levels. In untransfected Jurkat cells, pERM is highly colocalized with the GFP-PH domain, indicating high PIP2 levels in the vicinity of pERM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Transfection of the constitutively active PLC construct abolishes the plasma membrane enrichment of the GFP-PH domain, documenting that it causes reduction in PIP2 (concurrent with inducing dephosphorylation of ERM proteins and delocalization of ERM proteins from the membrane). Moreover, exposure of the cells to either SDF-1 or PLC activator induces redistribution of GFP-PH into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). Thus, these stimulations indeed induce hydrolysis of PIP2.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduction of PIP2 concentration induces moesin and ezrin release from cortical membrane in Jurkat cells</title><p>To directly test whether the depletion of PIP2 suffices to induce ERM protein dissociation from membrane in cells, we experimentally decreased the levels of PIP2 using a recently described approach involving drug-inducible recruitment of type IV phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase (5-ptase) to the plasma membrane to acutely reduce PIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Varnai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Zeijl et al., 2007</xref>). This approach exploits rapamycin-induced heterodimerization of the CFP-tagged plasma membrane&#x02013;targeted FRB (FK-506&#x02013;binding protein [FKBP]&#x02013;rapamycin binding) fragment of mTOR with the monomeric RFP (mRFP)&#x02013;tagged 5-ptase fused to FKBP12. Upon the addition of rapamycin, the 5-ptase enzyme is recruited to the plasma membrane and causes rapid hydrolysis of PIP2 at the 5 position to generate PI4P. Functionality of this strategy was confirmed by the finding that addition of rapamycin induces the membrane recruitment of 5-ptase and the loss of GFP-PH membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>, bottom left; and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807047/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807047/DC1</ext-link>). To test whether this inducible reduction of PIP2 can induce dissociation of ERM proteins from the membrane, Jurkat cells were transfected with GFP-tagged moesin and ezrin constructs along with the membrane-targeted FRB-CFP and the mRFP-FKBP&#x02013;5-ptase domain constructs. Rapamycin-induced recruitment of the 5-ptase to the membrane causes translocation of moesin-GFP and ezrin-GFP into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> and Fig. S1). Quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>) demonstrates a 1.7-fold enrichment of moesin and a more modest 1.2-fold enrichment of ezrin at the membrane before rapamycin but abolition of that enrichment after rapamycin. Control transfections (in which the 5-ptase construct is replaced by one lacking the ptase domain) show that neither the PH domain reporter nor moesin-GFP loses their membrane enrichment after rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Thus, PIP2 hydrolysis alone induces release of moesin and ezrin from the plasma membrane.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Membrane translocation of type IV 5-ptase reduces plasma membrane PIP2 and releases moesin and ezrin from the membrane.</bold> (A) Jurkat cells were transfected with GFP-tagged PH domain or the indicated GFP-moesin or GFP-ezrin constructs, along with the membrane-targeted FRB-CFP and the mRFP-FKBP domain constructs (with or without type IV 5-ptase domain as indicated), and were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy before and after rapamycin (Rapa) treatment.

Therefore, we first assessed whether C-terminal phosphorylation controls membrane association by monitoring GFP-tagged phosphomimetic moesin (T558D) in Jurkat cells. The phosphomimetic moesin (T558D) construct was more highly enriched at the plasma membrane than wild type (wt; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>, 3.4 vs. 1.8; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>, 3.3 vs. 1.7). Surprisingly, the membrane association of the T558D construct was completely disrupted in cells expressing the constitutively active PLC-&#x003b3;1 NN construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>). Thus, although ERM protein phosphorylation augments membrane association, action of PLC can abolish membrane association even of the phosphorylated form.</p><p>We tested the ability of PIP2 hydrolysis by itself (by 5-ptase recruitment) to trigger disassociation of phosphomimetic moesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). After rapamycin treatment, there is marked redistribution of T558D to the cytosol. But even after treatment, the T558D protein has limited residual enrichment at the membrane (unlike wt after rapamycin). The residual enrichment suggests that phosphorylation cooperates (or synergizes) with PIP2 in activating ERM proteins rather than substituting for it (see Discussion). It is interesting that the T558A mutation has a behavior intermediate between wt and T558D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). We interpret this to indicate that the threonine 558 side chain participates in stabilizing the closure of moesin FERM to C terminus and that mutation of threonine to alanine therefore causes limited relaxation of autoinhibition. Investigation of ezrin confirmed that it resembled moesin in three key respects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>): membrane localization of the wt protein depended on PIP2, the phosphomimetic mutant protein had augmented membrane localization, and the phosphomimetic mutant protein continued to depend on PIP2 for most of its membrane localization.</p><p>Exploration of issues related to PIP2-mediated activation of ERMs has been facilitated by the description of an ezrin construct that is defective in PIP2 binding as a result of four K to N mutations (K4N) in the FERM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barret et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fievet et al., 2004</xref>).

Therefore, we reassessed under standardized conditions whether interaction of the cytoplasmic tails of four transmembrane proteins with moesin depended on phospholipid. The results demonstrate that the binding of all of four GST-tagged tails to moesin is dependent on the presence of PIP2 and is not replaced by phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>).

If so, in vitro binding of mutant ERM proteins to cytoplasmic tails should depend on PIP2 in a manner similar to that observed with moesin mutant constructs in intact cells. We restricted our analysis of that question to one tail, CD44, because the lipid dependence of the four tails tested is similar. Results of such testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>) demonstrate a virtually perfect concordance. The T558D mutant displays enhanced binding in the presence of PIP2 (relative to wt) and a small amount of PIP2-independent binding (not observed in wt) exactly as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>.

The model system of rapamycin-induced 5-ptase recruitment allows testing whether PIP2 hydrolysis by itself is sufficient.

This study addresses three aspects of ERM protein inactivation. First, PLC activity is required for chemokine-mediated dissociation of ERM proteins from the membrane. Second, in contrast to the typical emphasis on DAG and IP3 signaling in hematopoietic cells, our results demonstrate the importance of PIP2 hydrolysis because reduction in PIP2 levels is sufficient to induce ERM protein dissociation from the membrane. Third, our results indicate that ERM phosphorylation is not sufficient to maintain ERM proteins at the membrane. Phosphorylation of ERM proteins also fails to eliminate their dependence on PIP2 for in vitro binding to cytoplasmic tails. Furthermore, reduction in PIP2 in vivo is sufficient to induce ERM protein dephosphorylation. The discussion focuses on integrating these findings into a broader understanding of ERM proteins.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that PLC mediates chemokine-induced inactivation of ERM proteins in lymphocytes, which is the first implication of PLC in ERM protein inactivation in any cell type. This inactivation is initiated by chemokine binding to a GPCR, CXCR4, and thus fits the paradigm that PLC activation commonly results from GPCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rhee, 2001</xref>). Identification of the relevant PLC genes has been impeded by the existence of more than a dozen PLC isoforms. Previous studies implicate PLC &#x003b2;2/&#x003b2;3 as limited contributors to T lymphocyte migration in double knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bach et al., 2007</xref>), but our experiments do not show a major decrease in chemokine-induced ERM protein dephosphorylation in such mice (unpublished data). We chose PLC-&#x003b3;1 for our genetic confirmation of PLC&#x02019;s capacity to mediate ERM protein inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>) because that isoform is strongly expressed in T cells, and recent evidence indicates that isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dar and Knechtle, 2007</xref>) or a closely related isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Gorter et al., 2007</xref>) is involved in chemokine-induced migration. Moreover, the T cell receptor also mediates ERM protein dephosphorylation and membrane relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faure et al., 2004</xref>) via a signaling pathway that depends on the same two molecules that mediate PLC-&#x003b3;1 activation, Vav-1 and Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zugaza et al., 2004</xref>). Identification of the PLC isoforms that mediate chemokine-induced ERM inactivation in primary T cells is an important question for future research.</p><p>This study shows that inactivation of ERMs in lymphocytes by PLC can be explained by PLC-mediated reduction of plasma membrane PIP2. The efficacy of these molecular mechanisms is established using the recently devised strategy for inducing rapid hydrolysis of PIP2 by drug-induced translocation of 5-ptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Varnai et al., 2006</xref>). This approach provides confirmation of the view that plasma membrane PIP2 is a regulator of processes/assemblies at the plasma membrane, especially cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Janmey and Lindberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McLaughlin and Murray, 2005</xref>). For example, this approach has been used (a) to characterize regulatory effects of PIP2 on ion channels and gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Varnai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Zeijl et al., 2007</xref>) and (b) to analyze the role of positively charged clusters of amino acids in recruiting proteins to the plasma membrane via PIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heo et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, and most relevant to this study, EGF-mediated activation of PLC reduces membrane PIP2 and releases cofilin from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Rheenen et al., 2007</xref>). Both this study and the aforementioned cofilin study corroborate the view that membrane PIP2 is a key regulator of molecules (such as cofilin and ERM proteins) that bind and influence the cortical cytoskeleton.</p><p>Although extensive work has been done on ERM protein interaction with phospholipid in vitro, in vivo studies have been limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barret et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yonemura et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fievet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rasmussen et al., 2008</xref>). The first in vivo evidence for the hypothesis that PIP2 plays a role in membrane localization of ERM proteins was based on mutational analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barret et al., 2000</xref>); the authors mutated pairs of positively charged lysine residues in the FERM domain that they predicted would mediate PIP2 binding and demonstrated that the mutation of two such pairs (a construct we refer to as K4N-moesin) impaired PIP2 binding in vitro and membrane localization in vivo of ERM protein. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yonemura et al. (2002)</xref> extended the in vivo understanding greatly by three key findings: ERM protein phosphorylation was not always required for membrane association, enhancing PIP2 by overexpression of PI4P5K-augmented ERM protein membrane association, and microinjection of neomycin reduced ERM membrane association apparently by reduction of available PIP2. The third study implicating PIP2 in ERM protein activation in cells described the use of a membrane-localized lipid phosphatase domain to blunt osmotic stress-induced ERM protein activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rasmussen et al., 2008</xref>). The fourth key study used the K4N-moesin to explore the relationship between PIP2 binding and phosphorylation and generated results supporting a model that PIP2 binding occurs first, causing release of autoinhibition and consequently enabling phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fievet et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fievet et al. (2004)</xref> study, we show that ERM proteins depend on PIP2 for membrane association even after phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>, C4; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fievet et al. (2004)</xref> concluded that PIP2 binding was a mechanism to activate ERM proteins, which after subsequent ERM phosphorylation became unnecessary for membrane binding. Two key elements of our study are critical to the altered interpretation. The first element is the use of drug-induced 5-ptase membrane localization to acutely alter PIP2 levels. This approach allows a clear demonstration that the localization of phosphomimetic moesin protein at the membrane is still dependent on PIP2. The second element is quantitation of the extent of enrichment of wt and mutant moesin constructs at the membrane. Although the phosphomimetic K4N protein is somewhat enriched at the membrane, its degree of enrichment is much less than the corresponding construct without the K4N mutation. Thus, even in the presence of pseudophosphorylation, PIP2 binding by those four K residues is still of major importance.</p><p>The foregoing finding, i.e., continued dependence of pERM on PIP2 for membrane association, has critical implications for the process that we set out to study, namely acute inactivation of lymphocyte ERM proteins by chemokine stimulation. If the Fievet model were correct, ERM inactivation should not be inducible by reduction of PIP2 because lymphocyte ERM proteins are substantially phosphorylated in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2003</xref>), and phosphorylation was interpreted to make ERM proteins independent of PIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fievet et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, because our study shows that pERM continues to depend on PIP2 for membrane association, reduction of PIP2 by PLC is an appealing mechanism for initiating ERM protein inactivation. Indeed, our study demonstrates that PLC activation is necessary for chemokine-induced ERM protein release from the cortex.</p><p>Results of in vitro experiments of moesin binding to cytoplasmic tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>) provide a candidate mechanism for the in vivo behavior. They suggest that binding of ERM proteins to cytoplasmic tails directly contributes to the in vivo requirement for PIP2 in ERM protein association with membrane. We extend what was previously known (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heiska et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yonemura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Serrador et al., 2002</xref>). First, to address conflicting data in the literature, we directly compared the tails of four relevant cytoplasmic proteins and examined the ability of other phospholipids to replace PIP2 requirement. The results demonstrate that all of the tails are dependent on PIP2 (unlike a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yonemura et al., 1998</xref>]) and that PIP2 cannot be replaced by phosphatidylserine. Second, they demonstrate that phosphorylation cannot replace PIP2 in promoting ERM protein binding to cytoplasmic tails in vitro. Thus, there is a parallel between the failure of phosphorylation to substitute for PIP2 in vitro for binding to cytoplasmic tails and its failure to substitute for PIP2 for enrichment at the membrane in vivo. Therefore, our findings suggest that PLC-mediated inactivation of ERM proteins is dependent in part on reducing the PIP2-dependent binding of ERM to cytoplasmic tails. The mechanism for this PIP2 dependence seems to relate primarily to PIP2-mediated conformation activation of intact ERM proteins rather than to a direct affect on the cytoplasmic tails because binding of cytoplasmic tails to FERM domain (as opposed to intact ERM protein) is not dependent on PIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirao et al., 1996</xref>; and unpublished data).</p><p>It is worth emphasizing that our findings are consistent with preexisting views that (a) PIP2 induces conformational activation that allows C-terminal phosphorylation and that (b) C-terminal phosphorylation also promotes activation (e.g., the finding that moesin T558D shows greater membrane enrichment than wt; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C, C3 vs. C1</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>, wt vs. T558D). However, our findings contradict the view that C-terminal phosphorylation fully replaces the PIP2 requirement, as seemed to be the conclusions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fievet et al. (2004)</xref>. Rather, our evidence supports a more complex view of cooperativity, either for in vivo membrane localization or in vitro association with cytoplasmic tails. Two findings are worth emphasizing in this context. First, in cells, the phosphomimetic moesin construct resembles the wt in depending on PIP2 but unlike the wt cannot be fully dissociated by 5-ptase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Second, the most dramatic illustration of this cooperativity is with moesin K4N binding to the CD44 tail. PIP2 alone or the T558D mutation alone has little effect, but the combination dramatically augments binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). It is worth noting that the PIP2 affect in this context must be independent of the K253/254 and K262/263, which have been mutated. Thus, this must reflect an independent structural role of PIP2 in inducing conformational change. The simplest hypothesis is that it reflects the PIP2 binding identified by x-ray crystallography, which promotes conformational change in the FERM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamada et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Among the rich literature on ERM protein activation, there is considerable work on cellular and biochemical processes that activate ERM. In contrast, this study focuses on the processes that regulate acute inactivation. The results demonstrate for the first time that PLC reduction of membrane PIP2 initiates that inactivation. PIP2 hydrolysis by itself is sufficient to induce ERM protein dephosphorylation, indicating that PIP2 regulation is the primary mediator of both activation and inactivation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and reagents</title><p>Jurkat T cell lines (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 &#x000b5;M 2-mercaptoethanol, and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen).

Membrane enrichment for that cell is calculated as the mean fluorescence of all pixels on the plasma membrane line divided by the mean fluorescence of all pixels on the cytosol line, and enrichment reported for a cell preparation is the mean for 10 randomly chosen transfected cells.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro pull-down analysis of the interaction with GST-tagged cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane protein</title><p>In brief, 1.0 &#x000b5;M purified moesin (wild type or mutants) was incubated with a five times molar excess of glutathione&#x02013;Sepharose 4B bead-immobilized GST-tagged tail proteins in the presence of the indicated phospholipids (sonicated as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirao et al., 1996</xref>]; Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) or IP3 (dissolved in water; Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) in 150 &#x000b5;l of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated at 4&#x000b0;C on a rotating wheel for 90 min. After centrifugation (600 <italic>g</italic> for 3 min), the beads were washed twice with buffer A and dissolved in 20 &#x000b5;l of 2&#x000d7; SDS-loading buffer. Two identical sets of samples were run using Nu-PAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). One set of samples is used for detecting the amount of moesin or mutants bound in the beads by immunoblotting using antimoesin antibody or Penta-His antibody, and another one is used for visualizing GST-tagged proteins by Coomassie blue staining after separation by SDS-PAGE.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows that recruitment of type IV 5-ptase to plasma membrane triggers the translocation of PIP2 marker, moesin, or moesin mutant constructs into cytosol.
