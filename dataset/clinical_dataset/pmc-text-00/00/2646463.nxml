These essential proteinaceous finger-like projections are central to ETEC vaccines currently in development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>. Generally, adhesion to intestinal epithelium by diarrhoeagenic <italic>E. coli</italic> is a very complex process that may involve a number of structures including flagella<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>. The role of flagella in ETEC pathogenesis has not been sufficiently explored<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. Flagella are complex cylindrical structures assembled from approximately 20,000 flagellin (FliC) molecules that travel down the nascent flagellar cylinder to the distal tip where they are directed by cap proteins (FliD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> into the growing flagellum. Flagellin has several major domains: the central domain projects on the surface of the flagellar shaft, accounting for antigenic variation used in <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x0201c;H&#x0201d; serotyping; conserved amino and carboxy regions interact with adjacent subunits, facing the inaccessible shaft core<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>.</p><p id="P5">Efficient adherence of ETEC to intestinal cells required both intact flagella and <italic>etpA</italic>, however flagella-dependent adherence was independent of serotype, as complementation of a <italic>fliC</italic> (H11<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) mutant with <italic>fliC</italic> (H48) restored both motility and adherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Likewise, antibody generated against (H48) full-length flagellin inhibited adherence of ETEC (H11) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) in contrast to antibody against serotype-dependent regions of flagellin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). Similarly, anti-EtpA antibodies inhibited adherence by EtpA-producing ETEC of multiple (H11, H12, and H16) serotypes while amounts of endogenous (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>) or exogenously added EtpA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>) paralleled the adherence phenotype.</p><p id="P6">Recombinant EtpA labelled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>) and bound specifically to the surface of intestinal cells, while antibodies against EtpA prevented this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Interestingly, labelled EtpA localized to mucin-producing regions of small intestine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>), suggesting that EtpA could promote ETEC interaction with intestinal mucosal surfaces.</p><p id="P7">Theoretically, EtpA must maintain contact with ETEC to promote adherence. Attempts to purify recombinant EtpA from <italic>E. coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> were confounded by co-isolation of another protein (&#x02248;50 kDa) despite attempted separation by column chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>), suggesting a potential protein-protein interaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>. MALDI-TOF definitively identified the co-purified protein as <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 flagellin (H48, the same serotype as the recombinant used in the expression) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Application of this purification strategy to ETEC strain H10407 (serotype H11) supernatants demonstrated that all EtpA-containing fractions also contained flagellin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>), suggesting that EtpA interacts with multiple H serotypes of flagellin, and serendipitously alluding to a mechanism of action for EtpA. Co-immunoprecipitation of H10407 culture supernatants with anti-EtpA antibody<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> confirmed that FliC (H11) and EtpA interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). FliC secreted by the <italic>fliD</italic> mutant, which cannot assemble monomers into intact flagella<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>, still interacted with EtpA, implying that EtpA can bind monomeric flagellin. Glycosylation of EtpA, a process dependent on the <italic>etpC</italic> gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, also did not appear to be required. In co-IP experiments using additional motile ETEC strains, we could immunoprecipitate flagellin from EtpA-producing strains E24377A (H28) and TX-1 (H12), but not the <italic>etpA</italic> mutant control. Similarly, immobilized flagellins from different serotypes (FliC<sub>H11</sub>, and FliC<sub>H48</sub>) captured biotin-labelled EtpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) further demonstrating that these interactions are not dependent on flagellar serotype.</p><p id="P8">These interactions of EtpA with FliC monomers of multiple serotypes suggest that EtpA engages highly conserved regions of these molecules. Interestingly, position-specific-iterative-BLAST (PSI-BLAST)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> searches identified not only putative bacterial adhesins, but subtle homology with amino and carboxy terminal regions of flagellins raising the possibility that EtpA interacts with multiple serotypes by mimicking these conserved domains. We next constructed recombinant (H48) flagellin proteins representing the full-length molecule including the unique serotype-determining region, as well as a truncated version consisting of amino acids 1&#x02013;173 (the conserved N-terminal domain), and a third peptide containing amino acids 174&#x02013;498. The conserved N-terminal domain was both necessary and sufficient to pull down EtpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). In addition, antibodies against either the full-length H48 flagellin or the conserved N-terminal (1&#x02013;173) region significantly inhibited adherence of ETEC H10407 (H11) to Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Together, these data implicate highly conserved regions of flagellin molecules in both EtpA binding and in adherence.</p><p id="P9">Intriguingly, following infection of host cells, ETEC were rapidly tethered to the surface via flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a&#x02013;b</xref>). Although conserved regions (CR) of flagellin are largely buried within the flagellar shaft <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, we reasoned that EtpA might interact with CR of monomers available at the ends of flagella, particularly if the rotating FliD pentameric cap became dislodged from the tip. Accordingly, <italic>in situ</italic> immunogold labelling studies indicated that conserved FliC regions are available exclusively at the tips of flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c&#x02013;e</xref>). Likewise, EtpA bound largely at tips of intact flagella from ETEC strains belonging to different serotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f&#x02013;h</xref>). Conversely, fragmentation of flagella exposed additional EtpA binding sites supporting the concept that EtpA interacts with regions of flagellin typically buried within the flagellar shaft.</p><p id="P10">Because EtpA appeared to be concentrated at the tips of flagella, we also investigated whether rEtpA might also interact with the flagellar cap protein, FliD. However, we found no evidence for this in molecular pull-down experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Additionally, we found that <italic>in vitro</italic> FliD inhibited interaction of EtpA with FliC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>), suggesting that the FliD cap might inhibit binding of EtpA to (CR) of flagellin. Similarly, we could not demonstrate co-localization of either the CR or EtpA with the FliD protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4c&#x02013;i</xref>) arguing that when FliD is firmly attached, the CR are inaccessible to EtpA. Exogenously added rEtpA localized to the flagellar tips of the <italic>etpA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 4j&#x02013;k</xref>) without compromising length, and deletion of <italic>etpA</italic> had no effect on flagellar length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that EtpA, binds opportunistically to conserved residues of flagellin at the tips of mature flagella when these domains are exposed by loss of the FliD cap protein complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>, or as these molecules leak<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> from ends of flagella in the absence of an intact cap structure. We believe that our data, generated by <italic>in situ</italic> immunogold labelling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> of whole bacteria, are consistent with the highly dynamic rotating pentameric cap structure proposed previously based on elegant electron cryomicroscopic techniques<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>.</p><p id="P11">To investigate whether the EtpA-flagellin interaction was required for the adherence phenotype we performed linker scanning mutagenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> of <italic>etpA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In general, mutations within the repeat region of <italic>etpA</italic> did not interfere with secretion of EtpA or with binding to flagellin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>), suggesting that the 5&#x02019; end of <italic>etpA</italic> encodes domains essential for secretion (similar to other TPS molecules) and for flagellin binding. Further analysis of in-frame mutations mapping to this region lead to the identification of a secreted EtpA mutant molecule with an insertion beginning at residue Q<sub>414</sub> of EtpA which retained its ability to bind to host cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c&#x02013;d</xref>) but that had lost the capacity to bind flagellin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Recombinant myc-tagged wt EtpA expressed in the <italic>etpA</italic> mutant localized to the tips of flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4f</xref>) unlike the Q<sub>414</sub> molecule. Compared to the wild type <italic>etpA</italic> gene, the mutant allele failed to complement the <italic>in vitro</italic> adherence defect in an isogenic <italic>etpA</italic> deletion strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4g</xref>), or when the mutated protein (EtpA<sub>Q414</sub>) was added exogenously to this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4h</xref>). EtpA is required for optimal colonization of the intestine by ETEC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>. Likewise, bacteria expressing EtpA<sub>Q414</sub> were not able to compete efficiently in intestinal colonization with those expressing the wt <italic>etpA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4i</xref>), suggesting that the association of EtpA and flagellin is critical for efficient interaction of ETEC with target host cells, and for colonization of mucosal surfaces.</p><p id="P12">Similar to other enteric pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>, we found that production of intact flagella was also required for efficient intestinal colonization by ETEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Since EtpA interactions with CR of flagellin are critical to promoting colonization, and EtpA is a protective antigen in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, we examined whether immunization of mice with a single H serotype of flagellin could target shared regions of flagellins thereby affording heterologous protection against intestinal colonization. Immunization with full-length flagellin (H48) stimulated production of serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5b</xref>) and fecal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>) antibodies recognizing conserved regions of flagellin, accessible at the tips of H11 flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5d&#x02013;g</xref>) and dramatically impaired colonization by ETEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5h</xref>). These antibodies also inhibited adherence of ETEC expressing the heterologous flagellin H11 serotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5i</xref>). Collectively, these studies suggest that conserved residues of flagellin, implicated here in bacterial adherence and colonization, could also serve as viable vaccine targets.</p><p id="P13">These studies offer a novel paradigm for bacterial adhesion as they demonstrate for the first time that a secreted virulence protein interacts with highly conserved regions of flagellin exposed at the tips of flagella, exploiting these long (&#x02248;10&#x02013;15 &#x000b5;m) appendages to tether EtpA adhesins that anchor bacteria on initial engagement of host cells. The precise contributions of EtpA and flagella relative to the established critical role of colonization factors in ETEC adherence remain undefined. However, preliminary data suggest that these are early transient interactions acting in concert to facilitate resilient pathogen-host interactions mediated by shorter (0.5&#x02013;1&#x000b5;m) spring-like<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> colonization factors.</p><p id="P14">EtpA or EtpA-like molecules are present in many ETEC strains from multiple flagellar serotypes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, suggesting that interactions between EtpA and flagellin are not limited to a small subset of ETEC strains. Likewise, homology searches of EtpA revealed the presence of many potential EtpA-like molecules in other motile Gram-negative pathogens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>) raising the possibility that these could function in a similar fashion. Interestingly, another TPS exoprotein, HMW1 (<italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>), employs disulfide bonds between carboxy-terminal cysteine residues to link fibrillar adhesin structures to the bacterial surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>. Absence of similar residues in EtpA and EtpA-like TPS proteins identified in genomes of other flagellated pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> may permit free secretion of these molecules for interactions with flagella.</p><p id="P15">Flagellar organelles have previously been dismissed in development of ETEC vaccines due to substantial variation in H serotypes and the assumption that only variant FliC regions were exposed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. The highly conserved flagellin domains implicated in the present studies, potent stimuli of innate immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, might also be exposed on commensal organisms. However, dependence of ETEC flagella-mediated adhesion on TPS, a unique adaptation of pathogenic bacteria, is likely one critical step in a process involving several adhesins including well-defined ETEC fimbrial colonization factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. Although the precise mechanism linking EtpA and flagella is not entirely clear, our data do suggest that EtpA and similar molecules as well as highly conserved flagellin ligands could serve as viable antigenic targets in design of novel vaccines to prevent infections caused by ETEC and other important motile pathogens.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Methods Summary</title><p id="P16">Detailed methods are contained within the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Information (SI)</xref>.
