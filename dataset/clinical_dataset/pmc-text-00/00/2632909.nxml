Individual zinc-finger domains (ZFDs) bind specific DNA triplet sequences; their apparent modularity has led some groups to propose methods that allow virtually any desired DNA motif to be targeted <italic>in vitro</italic>. In practice, however, ZFPs engineered using this &#x02018;modular assembly&#x02019; approach do not always function well <italic>in vivo.</italic> Here we report a modular assembly scoring strategy that both identifies combinations of modules least likely to function efficiently <italic>in vivo</italic> and provides accurate estimates of their relative binding affinities <italic>in vitro</italic>. Predicted binding affinities for 53 &#x02018;three-finger&#x02019; ZFPs, computed based on energy contributions of the constituent modules, were highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.80) with activity levels measured in bacterial two-hybrid assays. Moreover, <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values for seven modularly assembled ZFPs and their intended targets, measured using fluorescence anisotropy, were also highly correlated with predictions (<italic>r</italic> = 0.91). We propose that success rates for ZFP modular assembly can be significantly improved by exploiting the score-based strategy described here.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ability to reliably engineer DNA binding proteins that recognize any desired DNA sequence would provide an unprecedented level of control over genetic information; for example, by allowing the creation of site-specific nucleases that specifically alter genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>). The C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger domain (ZFD) is arguably the best characterized DNA binding motif and offers considerable promise for the rational engineering of site-specific DNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11">6&#x02013;11</xref>). Zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) consist of multiple individual ZFDs, each of which typically recognizes adjacent sequence triplets in duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). An individual ZFD comprises a pair of anti-parallel &#x003b2;-strands and one &#x003b1;-helix, which coordinate a zinc ion through conserved pairs of cysteine and histidine residues. In the canonical three-finger domain of the Zif268 transcription factor, the amino acid side chains at positions &#x02212;1, +3 and +6 relative to the amino-terminal end of the &#x003b1;-helix typically make base-specific contacts with three adjacent nucleotides within the major groove of double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). An aspartic acid residue in the +2 position of the DNA recognition helix can specify a fourth nucleotide, resulting in either target-site overlap with an adjacent module or specification of an additional nucleotide at the 3&#x02032;-end of the target site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>A three-finger ZFP with its DNA target site. A ZFP consisting of three adjacent ZFDs binds its target DNA through contacts between the amino acids of the DNA recognition helices and consecutive nucleotides in the DNA.

Note that an &#x02018;unnatural&#x02019; extended array is shown to better illustrate the critical amino acid/nucleotide contacts.

Using a &#x02018;modular assembly&#x02019; approach, novel ZFPs that recognize variant DNA sites are assembled by simply stringing together individual ZFDs. In practice, however, ZFPs made by modular assembly display a wide range of binding affinities and specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21 B22 B23">21&#x02013;23</xref>). Although modular assembly has proven useful for some <italic>in vivo</italic> applications, such as artificial transcription factors, recent work suggests that the success rate of creating artificial zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs&#x02013;fusions of engineered zinc fingers to a non-specific nuclease domain) by this method is considerably lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). These low success rates, together with the inability to predict which ZFPs are likely to function <italic>in vivo</italic>, have motivated our groups to improve the procedures and design criteria for ZFP engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>The present study was motivated by our observation that among a small set of modularly assembled ZFPs, those that fail to function <italic>in vivo</italic> are more likely to possess modules previously shown to have relatively low affinity for target DNA. This observation implies that insufficient affinity can contribute to poor function <italic>in vivo</italic> and also suggested that it might be possible to predict the affinity of a modularly assembled ZFP using existing affinity data for component modules. Here we test these hypotheses and demonstrate that both the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding affinity and the lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of a ZFP can be predicted using the energy contributions of its component ZFDs. Our approach for predicting the binding of ZFPs to desired target sequences should improve success rates of modular assembly by guiding investigators away from target sites and ZFP combinations least likely to function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Zinc-finger modules and three-finger arrays (ZFPs)</title><p>All ZFDs used in these experiments have been described by the Barbas group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and are referred to as &#x02018;Barbas modules&#x02019;.

ZFP compositions were chosen to systematically explore a wide range of predicted binding affinities and to test the influence of context on module performance.

Briefly, in constructing the 27 different three-finger proteins, nine ZFDs were used approximately 8&#x02013;10 times (approximately three times at each of the possible three positions, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

This approach resulted in an estimated <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 2.5 nM for this module, 10-fold lower than the previously reported value of 25 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Incorporating this new estimate improved correlation between the <italic>in vitro</italic> energy model and <italic>in vivo</italic> fold activation data (<italic>r</italic> = 0.86, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>c).</p><p>To directly evaluate the effects of individual module affinities on <italic>in vivo</italic> performance, sets of related ZFPs designed to vary at a single module position were analyzed for differences in B2H activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). For all three sets of ZFPs in which the F1 position was varied (while F2 and F3 were fixed), the greatest <italic>in vivo</italic> activity was observed when the F1 position contained a high affinity module; the least activity was observed with a low affinity module in this position. The same trend was observed for all four groups in which the F3 position was varied while the F1 and F2 fingers were fixed. For sets in which the F2 position was varied, only one strong module (TSGSLVR) and one moderate affinity module (QSSSLVR) were tested. In these cases, the moderate affinity module outperformed the high affinity module. These results suggest that the effect of single module substitutions on relative binding affinity can be predicted reliably in most cases.</p><p>In summary, three lines of analysis: (i) predictions based on <italic>in vitro</italic> binding constants for modules in a fixed context, (ii) predictions derived from a system of linear equations based on <italic>in vivo</italic> performance and (iii) analysis of the effects of various single finger substitutions <italic>in vivo</italic>, demonstrate that <italic>in vivo</italic> performance for ZFPs can be predicted based on DNA-binding affinities of individual ZFDs.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> DNA binding affinities of ZFPs are highly correlated with predicted binding energies</title><p>Our success in estimating the activities of ZFPs in the B2H assay suggested that our scoring scheme could be applied more generally to predict <italic>in vitro</italic> ZFP affinities. To test whether activation measured in the B2H assay directly reflects DNA binding affinity for the desired target site, 9 of the 27 engineered proteins, along with a control Zif268 protein, were chosen for <italic>in vitro</italic> binding affinity measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values were determined using fluorescence anisotropy (FA), a rapid and reproducible solution-based DNA binding assay that allows computation of the bound fraction of a fluorescently labeled ligand, based on the decrease in its rotational velocity due to binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).<fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Determining binding affinity constants using fluorescence anisotropy.

From 168 modularly assembled ZFPs, we selected all ZFPs comprising GNN or TGG modules for which published <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding affinity constants are available [measured in the F2 position of the standard Zif268 variant backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>)]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a, based on a segmental linear regression model, binding energies for 24 of these 26 ZFPs are highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.80) with reported B2H activity measurements. These results are also in excellent agreement with the results described above and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>b, although slightly higher activation levels were uniformly observed in the latter experiments.

We also showed that these predicted binding energies are in excellent agreement (<italic>r</italic> = 0.91; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a) with binding affinity constants measured directly <italic>in vitro.</italic> Furthermore, we showed a strong correlation between these computed binding energies and ZFP activities in a B2H system for two different sets of modularly assembled three-finger ZFPs. This is an important advance because a ZFP that lacks activity in the B2H system will also have a high probability of failing to function as a ZFN in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>). Thus, using only our scoring method, researchers can now identify target sites that will have a high probability of failing to yield functional zinc-finger arrays by the method of modular assembly. Our rule-based strategy will thus allow researchers to focus their modular assembly efforts on a smaller number of target sites with a higher probability of success.</p><p>We believe that our results also provide one potential explanation for the discrepancy between the overwhelming success rates for a previous <italic>in vitro</italic> report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and the low <italic>in vivo</italic> success rates observed for ZFPs in the recent study of Ramirez <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>): many of the modules used to perform modular assembly likely possess low affinities. Our data suggest, in fact, that 30&#x02013;50% of potential three-finger ZFPs made wholly from the Barbas GNN modules will fail to function in the B2H system, a result in agreement with the recently published results of Ramirez <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Although our results demonstrate that the energy contributions of individual ZFDs in a ZFP array are additive, we also believe they lend additional support to the notion that context is an important parameter that should be accounted for when engineering multi-finger ZFPs (i.e. that one single ZFD module will not always be optimal or adequate for recognition of its cognate 3-bp subsite in different multi-finger ZFP contexts). For example, our data show that although a weak finger will sometimes be found in a nonfunctional ZFP array (if it is joined together with other weak affinity ZFDs), it will also sometimes be found in functional arrays when paired with stronger affinity ZFDs. In addition, our data show that although strong fingers will sometimes be found in functional ZFPs, they can be found in nonfunctional ZFPs. Furthermore, the use of three strong fingers in a ZFP can lead to toxicity in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Although the precise mechanism of this toxicity is unclear, a reasonable hypothesis is that excessively high affinity leads to binding to related but off-target sequences with sufficient affinity to cause biological consequences (essentially, excessive affinity leading to problems of specificity). Thus, our data further re-enforce the ideas that individual ZFDs do not function completely independently and that the specific attributes of neighboring fingers do matter in the context of engineering a multi-finger ZFP.</p><p>The importance of context-dependent effects also suggests that identification of additional ZFDs with variable affinities for GNN triplets may be needed if the efficiency of modular assembly is to be improved. If such ZFDs were available, it might be possible to achieve higher success rates for modular assembly by creating several ZFPs for a given target site so as to identify a combination that balances affinities (and presumably, specificities) of its component ZFDs. A related point is that our findings also suggest one possible reason why more complex selection-based methods that account for context-dependent effects [e.g. the OPEN method recently described by Joung and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>)] may be more successful than modular assembly: these methods are able to balance the overall affinity and specificity of the final ZFP array by identifying optimal combinations from various ZFDs with a range of affinities and specificities for their target 3-bp subsites.</p><p>The strong correlations among predicted binding energies, <italic>in vivo</italic> activities, and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding affinity constants for the ZFPs analyzed in this work suggests that our rule-based approach might be extended to evaluate arrays assembled using GNN modules from other sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and non-GNN modules. We have not yet evaluated such modules, but our work demonstrates two ways this could be achieved: (i) by directly measuring <italic>in vitro</italic> binding constants for modules in the F2 position of a standardized ZFP framework and (ii) by computing individual module contributions to ZFP binding as component variables of a system of linear equations that describe their activities (measured <italic>in vivo</italic> in this work, but <italic>in vitro</italic> binding constants could also be used). The energy scoring scheme proposed here will allow researchers to determine whether a modular assembly strategy is likely to be feasible for specific targets of interest, based on currently available well-characterized modules, or whether an alternative selection-based engineering strategy should be considered.</p><p>A recent study on the use of ZFNs for homologous recombination cited lack of specificity as a primary determinant of ZFN-mediated toxicity in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). A likely mechanism for ZFN-induced toxicity is through binding to genomic sequences similar to the desired target sequence. As noted above, we observed toxicity in bacterial cells for several ZFPs, even in the absence of a fused nuclease domain, suggesting that ZFP binding to certain sites in genomic DNA can be toxic, particularly for high affinity ZFPs. Although this is the first published report of such toxicity in bacterial cells that we are aware of, it has been observed previously for several other sites (Joung,J.K. unpublished data). However, bacterial expression of ZFPs with affinities in the pM range, with no toxic effects, has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). High-throughput chip or microfluidics-based DNA binding experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39 B40 B41">38&#x02013;41</xref>) could be used to obtain affinity and specificity data for virtually every possible target site for a given ZFP, providing additional insight into ZFP-induced toxicity and into the fundamental rules that govern the affinity and specificity of DNA recognition by zinc-finger DNA binding proteins.</p><p>A correlation between ZFP binding constants measured <italic>in vitro</italic> and functional activity measured <italic>in vivo</italic> has also been observed by others using different reporter systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). A similar degree of correlation was observed using the B2H system in our study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn962/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>). Our results further demonstrate that measurable ZFP activity in an <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay does not necessarily translate into adequate function <italic>in vivo</italic>, in agreement with Beerli <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). However, the energy threshold we determined for ZFP activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, using B2H assays, corresponds to a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of &#x0223c;100 nM, and thus differs from the estimated threshold <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of &#x0223c;10 nM reported as the minimum affinity necessary for ZFP function in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). The significance of this difference between thresholds determined in bacterial and mammalian cells is difficult to evaluate, given that functional assays and <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> measurements were performed in different laboratories using different assays and with ZFPs containing different numbers of fingers.</p><p>Stormo and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45 B46 B47">43&#x02013;47</xref>) have shown that the DNA-binding specificity of ZFPs can be effectively predicted from additive energy contributions of individual residues that make base-specific contacts with target site nucleotides. Our results complement this idea by demonstrating that the affinity of ZFPs also can be predicted, using affinity data for component modules. Our application of the binding energy additivity concept differs somewhat from that used by Stormo to predict specificity in that it assumes additivity of energy contributions at the individual finger rather than individual residue level. Also, our approach implicitly includes energetic contributions of residues that are not directly involved in base contacts (e.g. phosphate contacts), as well as energetic contributions resulting from context-dependent effects that presumably occur among recognition helix residues within each finger.</p><p>The apparent simplicity of modular assembly has contributed to the current focus on C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> ZFDs as the domains of choice for designing custom DNA binding proteins. Our results make it possible, for the first time, to reliably identify prospective binding sites that are unlikely to yield functional ZFDs by modular assembly using a set of GNN-specific finger modules. The rule-based strategy presented here can provide accurate guidance for both <italic>in vitro</italic> binding affinities and <italic>in vivo</italic> functionality for engineered ZFPs by computing energy contributions of individual ZFDs.
