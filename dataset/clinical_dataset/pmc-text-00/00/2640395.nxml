Therefore, revealing the underlying regulatory mechanisms of transcripts becomes imperative. However, for a complete understanding of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, we need to identify the regions in which they are found. We will call these transcriptional regulation regions, or TRRs, which can be considered functional regions containing a cluster of regulatory elements that cooperatively recruit transcriptional factors for binding and then regulating the expression of transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We constructed a hierarchical stochastic language (HSL) model for the identification of core TRRs in yeast based on regulatory cooperation among TRR elements. The HSL model trained based on yeast achieved comparable accuracy in predicting TRRs in other species, e.g., fruit fly, human, and rice, thus demonstrating the conservation of TRRs across species. The HSL model was also used to identify the TRRs of genes, such as p53 or <italic>OsALYL1</italic>, as well as microRNAs. In addition, the ENCODE regions were examined by HSL, and TRRs were found to pervasively locate in the genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings indicate that 1) the HSL model can be used to accurately predict core TRRs of transcripts across species and 2) identified core TRRs by HSL are proper candidates for the further scrutiny of specific regulatory elements and mechanisms. Meanwhile, the regulatory activity taking place in the abundant numbers of ncRNAs might account for the ubiquitous presence of TRRs across the genome. In addition, we also found that the TRRs of protein coding genes and ncRNAs are similar in structure, with the latter being more conserved than the former.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The identification of transcriptional regulatory elements that control the expression of each transcript is a fundamental and challenging problem in biology. Although tremendous progress has been made, both experimentally and computationally, the regulatory elements of genes are still not well understood, and only a handful of them have so far been experimentally verified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The computational identification of regulatory elements is difficult for several reasons. First, genomic regulatory elements are usually short and degenerate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Second, they are usually distributed across large genomic regions from the distant 5' upstream regions to the 3' downstream regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Meanwhile, ENCODE, a pilot project to identify all functional elements in the human genome sequence, has revealed that at least 93% of the human genome is transcribed in different cells and that regulatory sequences are symmetrically distributed around transcription starting sites (TSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, when searching these consensus sequences of transcriptional factor binding sites (TFBSs), typically 6 to 10 bases, we may obtain a large number of matches, but the majority of them have no relevant biological functions.</p><p>Many mechanisms controlling gene expression, including alternative TSSs and non-coding and antisense transcriptional controls, have been discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, most genes are controlled cooperatively by several transcription factors (TFs) binding to various regulatory elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These cooperating regulatory elements are often located in close spatial proximity to each other. Such co-appearance of regulatory elements can potentially help in the identification of transcriptional regulatory elements and regions. In this paper, we aim to identify and characterize such functional regulatory DNA regions. We term these regions transcriptional regulatory regions (TRR) and further define them as containing a cluster of cooperating regulatory elements which can recruit transcriptional factors for binding and then regulating the expression of transcripts. Once a TRR is identified, we show that further experiments can be conducted to elucidate its regulatory roles. Different from the widely recognized promoters (e.g., core promoters and proximal promoters), which are defined as DNA regions surrounding a specific location (e.g., TSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], TRRs include not only functional promoter regions as a subset which participate in driving initiation of transcription, but also functional DNA regions located in introns, exons, or other intergenic regions, far away from TSSs, but still exerting their implicit regulatory roles.</p><p>Since our present understanding of TRRs is limited and primitive, we need an enhanced biological context to improve our understanding. It has been known for years that organisms as diverse as human, rat, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and yeast use the same set of conserved proteins to initiate mRNA synthesis and that these proteins are collectively known as general transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, we propose the concept of core TRR, which refers to a DNA region containing a cluster of conserved regulatory elements commonly occurring in the majority of TRRs. Using this principle for the present study, we first focused on predicting the core TRRs and then illustrated how these core parts are common for different transcripts and conserved across species.</p><p>By incorporating the idea of TF regulatory cooperation, substantial work has been done in the identification of regulatory regions <italic>in silico</italic>. For instance, Wasserman and Fickett first proposed the concept of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory module (CRM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. CRM refers to a DNA segment, typically a few hundred base pairs in length, containing multiple binding sites which recruit several cooperating transcription factors to a particular genomic location at a particular condition. Methods of identifying CRMs have been studied intensively and have been applied to many different settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Most studies were based on sets of potentially co-regulated genes selected by using various approaches, including, for example, gene expression arrays and ChIP-chip data. These approaches mostly aim to identify CRMs for specific biological processes and/or functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, this study aims to predict TRRs, as defined above, directly from the genomic sequences without additional (a priori) information, such as the sets of co-regulated genes used as inputs of algorithms for CRM. The main difference between core TRRs and CRMs is that CRMs are characterized by a module consisting of function/gene-specific elements, while the core TRR is a cluster consisting of the common and conserved parts of TRRs. In fact, the identification and characterization of core TRRs are made possible by their conservation. We have found, moreover, that these conserved regulatory elements are often shared by many kinds of TRRs for various biological processes and functions. This study compares the possible regulatory regions of various genes with random sequences and/or coding sequences in order to identify core TRRs. For simple model organisms, such as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, intergenic regions can be taken as potential TRRs since they are relatively short (with median length of 400 bp), and most of them have regulatory roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Even though intergenic regions in most eukaryotic organisms are generally very large and not well understood, we show that the core TRRs are conserved among genes, not only in one organism, but also across species.</p><p>To accomplish this, we developed the hierarchical stochastic language (HSL) model which was previously used to identify vertebrate promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The hierarchical structure model was also employed to identify CRMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, in this study, we extended the HSL model to identify core TRRs based on a set of putative TRRs in yeast (positive set) and a negative set, either of coding DNA sequences or of randomly generated sequences. The HSL model first identifies a set of k-tuples (k = 6 in this study) that are significantly over-represented in the positive set versus the negative set. Pairs of k-tuples selected in the first step that are over-represented in the positive set compared to the negative set are then further identified. A classifier is then built to identify core TRRs in any given genomic DNA region. The detailed description of the HSL model is provided in the <bold>Methods </bold>section.</p><p>We first applied the HSL model to <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>in order to build a dictionary of vocabularies (tuple-pairs). It is remarkable to observe that the vocabularies defined by <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>were conserved across species such that the model trained based solely on <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>can be applied to other species with similar accuracy. We then applied the HSL model to identify TRRs of several genes, including the human p53 gene, the rice gene <italic>OsALYL1</italic>, and others. In addition, by applying our HSL algorithm to 50 experimentally verified promoters of microRNAs in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], our HSL model achieved accuracies similar to those in protein coding genes for the identification of TRR regions in upstream sequences, indicating that the core part for transcription of microRNAs is similar to that of protein coding genes. In addition, after applying HSL to ncRNAs in ENCODE human genome regions, we found that TRRs are located pervasively in the genomes and that most TRRs might be responsible for the regulation of ncRNAs. The TRRs of ncRNAs are more conserved than those of protein coding genes. Therefore, by using TRR analysis, this work provides important biological insights into gene regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We developed an HSL model for detecting core TRRs. We first showed that the HSL model based on yeast can be effectively used to predict TRRs of other organisms, including fruit fly, human and rice. We next applied the HSL model to several other cases, including (1) core TRRs of the p53 gene and genes potentially regulated by p53; (2) prediction of core TRRs for a new rice gene, <italic>OsALYL1</italic>, with experimental validations; (3) core TRRs of microRNAs of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>; (4) core TRRs of the sense/antisense gene pair P5CDH and SRO5 of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>; and (5) core TRRs in non-coding human DNA sequences.</p><sec><title>Building the HSL model using <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>sequences</title><p>The HSL model was applied to the identification of core TRRs of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The model was trained using 2961 putative core TRR sample sequences (positive samples) extracted from the regions (-500, +100) of these genes on chromosomes I-XII. Their initial ATG codon was used as the origin for two reasons. The open reading frame (ORF) is well annotated in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), and the initial ATG codon of yeast genes has also been used to evaluate signals such as histone modification and nucleosome positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>coding DNA sequences (CDSs) and random DNA sequences (RDSs) were used as the negative samples. A primary dictionary of 534 k-tuples (k = 6), over-represented in the positive samples and under-represented in both CDSs and RDSs, was constructed with a likelihood ratio score for each k-tuple. Similarly, a second level dictionary of 3070 pairs of k-tuples from the primary dictionary was further constructed. Since we used both CDSs and RDSs as negative samples, we hypothesized that the dictionary should be able to distinguish TRR sample sequences from both CDSs and RDSs. For a given DNA sequence, a score based on the tuple-pair (second level) dictionary was given for each window of L base pairs along the sequence to indicate the likelihood of core TRR, where L can be chosen based on the required resolution, and we used L = 300 in this study. A threshold can be given to distinguish the core TRRs from non-core TRRs. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows the top 100 (3.26%) high-scored tuple-pairs from the 3070 pairs. From Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, we can see that most of the top-scored tuple-pairs contain the TATA box-like motifs. We can also see some poly-T "TTTTTT" and poly-A "AAAAAA" words in the selected pairs. It is interesting to observe that poly-T and poly-A words are also over-represented in human promoter within the top 3 ranks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Other motifs, such as CAAT box-like motifs, can also be found in the tuple-pair dictionary (out of the top 100 ranks; not shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap

of verified genes in yeast. A total of 1317 genes on chromosomes XIII-XVI with annotation "Verified" and ORF regions of more than 400 bp were selected from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We aligned these 1317 sequences using their initial ATG codon as origin and calculated the average TRR scores for each aligned position. The results are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. The average scores peak in the region around -180 and decrease sharply in the downstream of ATG codon (blue curve in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Similar results were achieved for genes from training samples on chromosomes I-XI (red curve in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). It is well known that promoters tend to be located in nucleosome-free regions, and a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] showed that the region around -180 has the lowest average nucleosome-occupancy signal. This result is consistent with our finding that the region around -180 is enriched for TRRs. In addition, the standard deviation of TRR scores generally increases with the mean TRR score (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), possibly resulting in a different TRR score curve for individual genes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Core TRRs analysis for yeast</bold>.

We chose the region (-500, +100) of the 1317 genes as positive samples. We also generated the same number of negative samples with the same length as the positive samples by randomly sampling from gene regions on chromosomes XIII-XVI. For each sequence, if the maximum of the TRR scores along either sense or antisense strand is higher than a given threshold, the sequence is predicated to contain core TRRs. The true positive (TP) rate is taken as the percentage of predicated TRRs in positive samples, while the false positive (FP) rate is the percentage of predicated TRRs in the negative sample set. By setting different thresholds, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for our prediction model in yeast can be obtained and is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. When FP is set at 20%, the TP rate for yeast is 82%. Further studies of the relationship between TRR scores and gene transcriptional rates suggested a reasonable threshold score of TRR between 15 and 20 (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Using a threshold score of 20 for core TRRs, our algorithm predicted 1163 (88.3%) out of the 1317 genes with core TRRs in the region (-500, +100) with FP rate of 33.9%.

The low human TP rate on the region (-500,+100) may have resulted from the complexity of human regulatory sequences and from the fact that many core promoters may locate farther away from the (-500, +100) regions of their corresponding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Thus, we further extended the sequences of human positive samples to the upstream region; the corresponding sequences of negative samples were also generated with lengths equal to those in the positive sample set. From Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, we can see that, by extending the interrogating regions of samples, TP rates for human are markedly increased. When the region is extended to around (-1500,+100) and the FP rate is fixed at 20%, the TP rates for human reached 80% for the permuted negative samples, 60% for the randomly generated intergenic negative sample, but only 44% for the negative samples generated based on protein coding DNA sequence. The low TP rate in the case of protein coding DNA sequence as negative sample may be explained as follows. Multi-promoters and alternative splicing happen more frequently in human, and some TRRs may also locate in the coding areas. It has been shown that transcription not only starts in 5' UTR and 3' UTR, but it can also start in exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, negative samples of protein coding DNA sequence may also contain TRRs, which could then result in overestimation of the FP.

Although protein coding sequences are only ~1.2% of human genome, it was indicated that at least one-third of the human genome is represented by regulatory sequences for transcript expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. To gain insight into the functions of the non-coding regions, we first studied the TRRs of ncRNAs, most of which are widespread in the non-coding DNA region. We predicated core TRRs on 685 human microRNAs from miRBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] (only a small part of them are located in ENCODE regions since they are from the whole human genome) and 6587 putative ncRNAs in ENCODE regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. We took a region 800 bp upstream of each end of the ncRNAs as candidate regulatory regions. (Most ncRNAs are derived from the hairpin precursors; hence, both ends of the ncRNAs may be functional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]). For each ncRNA, if either candidate regulatory region from one end has a TRR score above a given threshold, then the ncRNA is predicated to have putative TRRs.

We also found that the HSL scores of TRRs for non-coding RNAs tend to be higher than scores for protein coding genes (data not shown), which therefore indicates that TRRs of ncRNAs are more conserved than TRRs of protein coding sequences.

Considering that over 10,000&#x02013;20,000 ncRNAs have been predicated in ENCODE regions (this number is still not completed) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], we postulate that most of our predicted TRRs in the non-coding regions may play essential roles in the regulation of ncRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Genomic annotations of core promoters (~80&#x02013;100 bp surrounding the TSSs) are of great importance to the understanding of transcriptional regulation, and numerous methods have been developed to identify core promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. High throughput technologies through expressed sequence tag cDNA/ETS/mRNA/CAGE sequences have been developed that can identify TSSs with high accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Recent computational methods, such as EP3, which utilizes DNA structure features (e.g., GC content and chemo-physical properties of DNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and CoreBoost_HM, which integrates histone modification information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], have been implemented and have achieved great improvements. However, few methods have been developed to identify functional regulatory DNA regions genome wide. For example, the EPD database, one of the main promoter databases, does not provide the real functional regulatory regions (TRRs, as we have termed them here), but rather self-setting regions around these experimentally verified TSSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. In this study, we found that many functional regulatory regions are located far away from the TSSs or in the intron of genes. This finding is consistent with the observations by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Hence, our HSL model may serve as an additional tool to supplement such computational methods as EP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and CoreBoost_HM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] for genomic annotations of potential DNA regulatory regions.</p><p>The fact that the number of experimentally verified samples of TRRs is limited makes statistical analysis of TRRs difficult. For this reason, core promoters have been widely studied, and the regions surrounding them may be good candidates for TRRs. However, for genomes of higher eukaryotes, core TRRs are often located in very long intergenic regions or even unknown regions. Moreover, higher eukaryotic genes may frequently be regulated from multiple alternative promoters. For these reasons, we chose the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>genome as the model system in our study because it contains relatively short intergenic regions (median length shorter than 400 bp) and a small number of introns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Hence, the intergenic regions in yeast are mostly regulatory regions and can be easily used as a proxy for the sample of TRRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The concept of core TRR, which we defined earlier, is the foundation of the studies conducted in this paper. Core TRR is similar to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory module (CRM) in that both characterize functional regions by a cluster of regulatory elements. The main difference is that CRM is characterized by a module consisting of function/gene-specific elements, while the core TRR is a cluster consisting of the common and conserved parts of TRRs. In order to identify CRMs, this difference leads to the need for algorithms to obtain information for sets of co-regulated genes. In contrast, our HSL model requires no such a priori information to elucidate the specific function of genes with reasonably high accuracy. Among the many reasons for this is the fact that TRRs are generally shared by many genes. Therefore, there is no need to pre-select sets of co-regulated genes. In addition, core TRRs are conserved, not only among genes in closely related species, but also across species. We showed that the vocabulary and scoring system of HSL, trained based on sequences of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, can be applied to other organisms, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, rice or human, with reasonable accuracy.</p><p>Once core TRRs, the conserved parts of TRRs, are obtained, their surrounding regions may be considered candidates of the TRRs. Thus, we can conduct further research to study gene-specific and/or organism-specific regulatory elements around TRRs. For example, p53 binding sites for the genes regulated by the p53 genes are usually located around TRRs and thus cooperate with other elements in the TRR region to exert their functions. Since single TFs cannot function alone, but often function through cooperation with other elements in the TRR, it is worth noting that TRR information can help us eliminate nonsense matches of binding sites in genomic searching.</p><p>The HSL model proposed for the identification of TRRs in this study differs from existing approaches in several ways. Unlike most probability models which assume certain models of the underlying sequence, e.g., certain Markov properties, HSL takes the approach of a simple scoring system based on word counting for each layer and excludes most vocabularies that do not appear frequently in the sample sequences. If the number of samples is sufficient, more layers of the HSL model can be added one by one until the model reaches a high enough accuracy for the identification of TRRs. For example, the HSL model using a single tuple dictionary performed poorly everywhere in the region in predicting core TRRs of the p53 gene in human, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>. In contrast, the HSL model using tuple-pair dictionary (second layer) identified 10 significant signals with scores higher than 20, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>. Among them, six are consistent with current biological understanding. Another advantage of the HSL model is that the computational program is fast and easy to implement.</p><p>Although the HSL model provides a useful tool to predict potential core TRRs based only on DNA sequence information, it may still yield high FP rates, especially for complex organisms, such as <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>. The available high throughput epigenetic information showed that functional TRRs are associated with a number of chromatin modification signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The information from high throughput assays on chromatin modifications and protein binding was used as evidence to support the predicated potential TRRs in ENCODE regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Histone modification has also been utilized, which has greatly improved the performance of TSS identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. In this study, this kind of information was used to support TRRs predicted in the p53 gene and p53 target genes. As additional examples, the TRR signals in the first intron of the p53 gene and TRRs in both the upstream and inside regions of the CDKN1A gene were further supported by chromatin modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and other information (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The intricate mechanisms between TRRs and chromatin modifications should be the subject of future studies.</p><p>Since the non-coding DNA sequences are mostly transcribed and remain to be annotated, it is difficult to obtain real "non-TRR" regions to estimate the false positive rate of HSL in the non-coding regions. It may be even harder to obtain real "non-TRR" regions than to verify TRR regions since many TRRs only function at specific conditions. Even the use of randomly generated intergenic regions by RSAT to obtain "non-TRR" regions may not achieve satisfactory results. This was observed in our study of human that had relatively high false positive rates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). A possible explanation for this result may lie in the heterogeneity of human sequences (mixtures of GC-rich and GC-poor regions), as well as the inability of RSAT to generate accurate human intergenic sequences. Similar problems with evaluations of motif-finding methods were also observed when using random sequences by RSAT (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/warnings.html"/>). Meanwhile, our results of p53 gene indicate that the false positive rate of our method is not high since most predictions in p53 genes are supported by biological evidence.</p><p>Recent studies showed that more than 93% of ENCODE-analyzed human genome nucleotides are transcribed in different cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, the genomes of all eukaryotes studied are almost entirely transcribed, generating an enormous number of non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), many of which play a major role in regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. These ncRNAs are transcribed separately by their own promoters (TRRs), and they are regulated by regions with core parts similar to those core TRRs for protein-coding transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Thus, it is not surprising to find that the core TRR regions can be located pervasively in the genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Meanwhile, for human, a number of statistical analyses have already revealed that non-coding sequences (randomly selected sequences) are hierarchically organized and convey more biological information than protein-coding sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Our results indicated that TRRs are located pervasively in the genomes, and most TRRs might be responsible for the regulation of ncRNAs; the TRRs of ncRNAs are more conserved than those of protein coding genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Evidence shows that genomes of eukaryotes are almost entirely transcribed, generating a large number of protein coding genes and an enormous number of ncRNAs. To reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms of these transcripts, we proposed the concept of core TRR which refers to a DNA region that contains a cluster of conserved regulatory elements commonly occurring in the majority of regulatory sequences that are essential for the expression of transcripts. We then constructed a hierarchical stochastic language (HSL) model for TRRs in yeast based on regulatory cooperation among core TRR elements. We found that the HSL model trained based on yeast achieved comparable accuracy in predicting TRRs in other species, thus demonstrating the conservation of TRRs across species. Examples such as p53 or <italic>OsALYL1</italic>, as well as the microRNAs, indicate that the identified core TRRs by HSL are highly accurate across species and can serve as proper candidates for the further scrutiny of specific regulatory elements and mechanisms. Our results also showed that core TRRs of protein coding genes and ncRNAs are located pervasively in the genomes and similar in structure, while the latter are more conserved than the former.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>DNA sequence preparations</title><p>A total of 2,961 sequences extracted from the region (-500, +100) of 2,961 genes (with verified open reading frame (ORF)) located on chromosomes I-XII of <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>were set as the putative TRR dataset for our algorithm.
