Introduction</title><p>Organic compounds based on phosphorus exert a broad variety of biological properties. From toxicological point, especially when biological effect is taken into consideration, organophosphorus inhibitors (OPI) of cholinesterases (ChE) are the most important chemicals of this group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-2243">1</xref>]. The inhibitory effect is based on phosphorylation or phosphonylation of the serine hydroxyl group at the ester part of the ChE active site of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-2243">2</xref>].</p><p>The standard treatment for OPI intoxication usually consists of administration of anticholinergic drugs (e.g. atropine), in combination with reactivator containing an oxime functional group in its structure. Anticholinergic drugs block the effects of overstimulation by accumulated acetylcholine at peripheral muscarinic receptors while the oximes, as compounds with nucleophilic activity, repair the enzyme by dephosphorylation and restore ChE activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-9-2243">3</xref>]. However, the efficacy of commonly used oxime reactivators is still not sufficient.</p><p>Tabun (GA agent; <italic>O</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N,N</italic>-dimethylphosphoramido cyanide) belongs to the nerve agents that could be misused for military purposes. Commonly used bisquaternaly reactivators of acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) are not able to counteract the toxic effects of tabun because of their very low reactivating efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-9-2243">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-9-2243">5</xref>], which has been explained by difficulties with the nucleophilic attack on the tabun phosphorus atom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-9-2243">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-9-2243">6</xref>]. The development of new and more effective AChE reactivator is still a challenge. For these reasons, eight new reactivators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-2243">Figure 1</xref>) of tabun-inhibited ChE have been synthesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-9-2243">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-2243">12</xref>] in an attempt to increase the reactivating efficacy of antidotes for treatment of poisoning by this nerve agent. These compounds were, according to our <italic>in vitro</italic> results, very promising against tabun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-9-2243">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-2243">13</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of reactivating effects of currently available oximes (HI-6, obidoxime and trimedoxime) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-2243">Figure 2</xref>) and the eight newly synthesized oximes (K206, K269, K117 - 22435, K127 - 22432, K250, K251, K347, K628) in combination with atropine (a commonly used anticholinergic drug) in tabun-poisoned rats. Syntheses as well as analyses of these reactivators were previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-9-2243">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-2243">13</xref>]. The other aim of this study was to compare the reactivation potency of these compounds against tabun-inhibited butyrylcholinesterase (BChE; EC 3.1.1.8). These <italic>in vivo</italic> data could be useful for preparation of effective pretreatment therapy including administration of pseudo-catalytic bioscavenger.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results|discussion"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><p>Tabun intoxication produces a strong depression of AChE activity in blood to approximately one third of the original activity. Among the currently available oximes, trimedoxime was found to be the best reactivator of the tabun-inhibited AChE. Among the newly synthesized oximes, the best result was obtained after administration of K127 (22432). Some oximes were irresponsive to tabun-inhibited AChE (K250, K251 and K628). The therapeutical effects of K206 and K269 were comparable with effect of trimedoxime. Results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-2243">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>The BChE activity was strongly decreased after tabun intoxication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-2243">Figure 4</xref>). The residual activity of tabun-inhibited BChE was 20 % of the original activity. Among the currently available oximes, trimedoxime was again the best. Some of newly synthesized oximes were not able to significantly reactivate tabun-inhibited BChE (K269, K250, K251, K628) and some (K117 - 22435, K127 - 22432) were as good as trimedoxime.</p><p>Strong inhibition of both cholinesterases was recorded in central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-2243">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-9-2243">6</xref>). The inhibition of BChE was not so strong with respect to peripheral compartment (plasma). Only trimedoxime and obidoxime from the reactivators were able to protect part of cholinesterases in brain tissues. Trimedoxime seems to be the best reactivator again, because it was able to increase AChE and BChE activity by more than 20% in CNS.</p><p>Generally, the efficacy of ChE reactivators depends on their reactivity and affinity towards organophosphate-inhibited enzymes. Their reactivity is derived from the nucleophilic activity of the oxime anion that is bound on a pyridinium ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-2243">14</xref>]. They differ from each other by the position of the oxime group on the pyridinium ring and the linker between pyridinium rings. The affinity of oximes for intact enzyme is determined by various physicochemical factors such as electrostatic attraction and repulsion, hydrophobic interactions and by the shape and size of the whole molecule as well as the functional groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-9-2243">15</xref>].</p><p>Bisquaternary reactivators have higher affinity towards both intact and inhibited ChE and higher potency to reactivate nerve agent-inhibited ChE compared to monoquaternary ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-9-2243">16</xref>]. One of the used reactivators, oxime K347, is a monoquaternary oxime with a benzyl group at the one position on the pyridinium ring, the reactivating potency of this compound was better than that of some bisquaternary oximes.</p><p>The position of the oxime group on the pyridinium ring is another factor influencing the reactivation efficacy. The oxime reactivators with the oxime group in the position 4 are the best reactivators of tabun-inhibited AChE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-9-2243">17</xref>]. The reactivators used in this comparative study, except for oxime K347 and HI-6, all had the oxime group in this position.</p><p>The linking chain between two pyridinium rings is another important factor influencing the potency of oximes. Although this part of the oxime reactivator molecule does not play any role in the dephosphorylation process, it is a major factor influencing reactivation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-2243">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijms-9-2243">19</xref>]. There is also only one difference between the composition of the obidoxime and trimedoxime connection chains (linkers). In several cases (oximes K206, K269, K250, K251), linkers with rigid double bond were used. Although K269 and K206 have good reactivating potency against tabun-inhibited AChE, if compared with the current best oxime against tabun - trimedoxime, in case of BuChE, their effect is not sufficient. Oximes K117 (22435) and K127 (22432) have longer linking chains with oxygen atoms in their structure. Their reactivation efficacies were different from those of other tested oximes. Oxime K127 (22432) was better than the currently used trimedoxime. Oxime K117 (22435) was comparable to obidoxime. Surprisingly, these oximes had good reactivating potency against tabun-inhibited BChE.</p><p>Carboxyl and methylcarbonyl groups on one of pyridinium rings (K250, K251) decreased the reactivation potency of tested oximes in case of both ChEs. The other important factor influencing oxime efficacy is its pharmacokinetics, as its distribution from the muscle to the blood stream plays an important role. The ability of oxime reactivators to go through the blood-brain barrier in an effective level and subsequently to have reactivation effect in brain is a hotly discussed topic nowadays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-9-2243">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijms-9-2243">23</xref>].</p><p>The inhibitions of ChE in CNS after administration of tabun were strong. The depression of AChE was stronger than inhibition of BChE. The reactivations of both ChE using newly synthesized oximes were not statistically significant. Only trimedoxime and obidoxime were able to protect the ChE in brain. This may be caused by better penetration through blood-brain barrier of these oximes.</p></sec><sec><title>3.

Intoxication and sample collection</title><p>Although the main route of administration of organophosphorus nerve agents is percutaneous or inhalation, we used intramuscular administration (i.m.) in our experiments, because there is better comparability with already available data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijms-9-2243">25</xref>]. A single dose of 1 &#x000d7; LD<sub>50</sub> of tabun was injected i.m..

Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the majority of the newly synthesized oximes were unable to surpass the efficacy of a currently used drug &#x02013; obidoxime. Only trimedoxime in both compartments and K127 (22432) in peripheral tissue were partially effective. Some newly synthesized oximes (K117 - 22435; K347) were as effective as oxime HI-6, but at levels insufficient for treatment of tabun-poisoning. No reactivation effect was found after administration of K628, K250, and K251. The partially protection of brain ChE against tabun was found only after administration of trimedoxime and obidoxime. However, these arguments might not hold in the case of soman poisoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijms-9-2243">28</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Mrs. Uhlirova and Mrs. Reslova for their skilful assistance.
