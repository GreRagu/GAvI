Small electrodes, structures and devices are necessary to achieve high-resolution and target-selectivity during stimulation and recording of neuronal networks, while significant charge transfer and large signal-to-noise ratio are required for accurate time resolution. In addition, the physical properties of the interface should remain stable across time, especially when chronic <italic>in vivo</italic> applications or <italic>in vitro</italic> long-term studies are considered, unless a procedure to actively compensate for degradation is provided. In this short report, we describe the use and fabrication of arrays of 120 planar microelectrodes (MEAs) of sputtered Iridium Oxide (IrOx). The effective surface area of individual microelectrodes is significantly increased using electrochemical activation, a procedure that may also be employed to restore the properties of the electrodes as required. The electrode activation results in a very low interface impedance, especially in the lower frequency domain, which was characterized by impedance spectroscopy. The increase in the roughness of the microelectrodes surface was imaged using digital holographic microscopy and electron microscopy. Aging of the activated electrodes was also investigated, comparing storage in saline with storage in air. Demonstration of concept was achieved by recording multiple single-unit spike activity in acute brain slice preparations of rat neocortex. Data suggests that extracellular recording of action potentials can be achieved with planar IrOx MEAs with good signal-to-noise ratios.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>substrate microelectrodes</kwd><kwd>extracellular recordings</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>impedance spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>neurons</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="26"/><page-count count="7"/><word-count count="4189"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>A number of reports, documenting the use of IrOx microelectrodes for neuroengineering and biomedical applications, have been recently presented in the literature. The interest in this material is driven by its excellent properties as a functional coating for implantable stimulation electrodes, with applications in stimulating/recording heart, neuronal or retinal tissues (Blau et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1997</xref>; Cogan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2006</xref>; Marzouk et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1998</xref>; Mokwa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2007</xref>). High-resolution electrical stimulation and recording directly benefits from miniaturization of the electrodes, whilst retaining a high and reversible charge capture and delivery capacity (Cogan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2005</xref>; Wessling et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2006</xref>). Although electrode coating with nanoparticles demonstrates excellent performances both in stimulation (Mazzatenta et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>) and recording (Gabay et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2007</xref>; Gabriel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2008</xref>; Keefer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2008</xref>), the regenerative electrical activation of IrOx electrodes is simpler and faster than nanotechnological fabrication or deposition processes.</p><p>In applications requiring extracellular recordings, the efficiency of the charge-delivery capacity of the electrodes material is of lower priority. However, low impedance and long-term stability of the interface is an important requirement and IrOx electrodes provide both of these requirements. This short paper will examine and discuss the use of arrays of activated IrOx electrodes, and their use for short-term <italic>in vitro</italic> extracellular recording of neuronal electrical activity. We report preliminary results employing neocortical acute tissue slices of the rat brain, selected as a target example to characterise IrOx electrode ageing and the recording of weak spontaneous electrical activity (Egert et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2002</xref>). In this context, <italic>in vitro</italic> simultaneous multisite recording of the spontaneous and evoked electrical activity of the nervous system represent an important step towards the understanding of the network-level and single-cell correlates of many (patho)physiological mechanisms (Rinaldi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2007</xref>; Silberberg and Markram, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2007</xref>), as well as a crucial requirement for the validation of large-scale mathematical models and theories of the brain (Markram, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2006</xref>; Traub et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>IrOx microelectrodes arrays</title><p>Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) were fabricated in clean rooms at the Institute of Microtechniqe of the EPFL and Institute of Electrical Engineering I at RWTH Aachen University, through a custom technological process (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Briefly, a reversal photoresist lift-off technique (AZ5214, Clariant, Germany) was employed to pattern metal using a glass substrate. The iridium layer was sputter-deposited as described in Wessling et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2007</xref>), with the following parameters: 180&#x000b0;W &#x02013; DC Power, 100 sccm &#x02013; Argon flow and 10.4 sccm &#x02013; oxygen flow. A layer of photosensitive SU-8 (5 &#x003bc;m) was finally used as an insulating layer (Lorenz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1997</xref>), covering the iridium leads while leaving free access to the electrodes sites and contacts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cross-section of a microelectrode array (A), showing the substrate, metal and insulation layers (SU-8 epoxy)</bold>.

Glass substrates are glued under the PCB with conductive materials, providing contacts to the PCB tracks. Finally, a glass ring was mounted on the top of the MEA using an epoxy/silicone sealant, defining a watertight recording chamber.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fneng-02-001-g001"/></fig><p>The MEA layout consisted in a 12&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10 square grid arrangement of 120 circular microelectrodes, each measuring 30&#x02009;&#x003bc;m in diameter and located 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;m apart from each other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). MEAs were glued onto printed circuit boards (PCB &#x02013; Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) by a screen-printing technique, to provide external interfacing to multichannel amplifying electronics (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). Platinum-based MEAs, with identical layout and electrode geometry, were also fabricated (Nam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2006</xref>), and employed for comparison. Finally, the recording chamber was sealed with epoxy and silicone sealant (e.g. Sylgard 184, Distrelec, Switzerland) to ensure watertight connection of the MEA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Top view of the full MEA assembled on a PCB (A) and close-up of the substrate electrode array (top-left corner) (B), showing 16 electrode sites and the insulated leads</bold>.

A brain tissue slice <bold>(C)</bold>, obtained acutely from the somatosensory rat cortex and comprising cellular layers between the <italic>pia</italic> and the <italic>white matter</italic> (WM), can be mechanically coupled to the MEA to record and stimulate the neuronal electrical activity (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fneng-02-001-g002"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Preparation of brain slices and pharmacology</title><p>Brain slices (300 &#x003bc;m thick) were prepared from Wistar rats, on postnatal days 15&#x02013;20, by standard procedures (K&#x000f6;ndgen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2008</xref>), in accordance with institutional and national guidelines (Cantonal Veterinary Service, license n. 1550.1 to M.G.). Briefly, brains were quickly excised and rinsed in ice-cold (&#x0003c;4&#x000b0;C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; containing in mM: 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 glucose, continuously bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Parasagittal neocortical slices were cut with a vibratome (VT1000S; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), trimmed down to an area of about 3 &#x000d7; 2 mm<sup>2</sup> centered to the primary somatosensory area (S1), and incubated at 35&#x000b0;C for 45 min. Slices were afterward left at room temperature (24&#x000b0;C). Electrophysiological recordings were carried out at room temperature, perfusing slices with an extracellular solution that differed from the aCSF in the concentration of potassium, calcium and magnesium ions (i.e. 6.25 KCl, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). This results in an increase of the basal level of spontaneous electrical activity, as in Berger et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2006</xref>) (see also Richardson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2005</xref>). In some experiments, NMDA (<italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartic acid, 10&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M) was applied to mimic the non-selective activation of glutamatergic NMDA-receptors and further probe network-level excitability. All the chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Merck (Switzerland).</p></sec><sec><title>Surface coating of the MEAs</title><p>MEAs were used repeatedly and cleaned before each experiment with methanol and distilled water. To improve mechanical adhesion of the tissue slice, the MEA surfaces was routinely coated with cellulose nitrate (CN, Schleicher &#x00026; Schuell, Dassel, Germany) dissolved in methanol (0.14&#x02009;mg/ml). 4&#x02013;6&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of this solution was spread out around the electrode area and dried in air. A glass ring (diameter 20&#x02009;mm), glued to the PCB base plate with silicone rubber (Sylgard 184, World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany), formed a recording chamber with a volume of 1.5&#x02009;ml.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Iridium activation process</title><p>IrOx microelectrodes were activated and restored to the activated state using a simple electrical protocol: each MEA electrode was connected to a potentiostat (AUTOLAB PGSTAT302, Echochemie, The Netherlands), with the counter and the reference terminals connected to a small platinum plate electrode, dipped into the phosphate buffer solution (PBS 10 mM phosphate buffer, 2.7 mM KCl and 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 at 25&#x000b0;C, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) with a contact surface of a few square millimeters. The MEA electrodes were used as the working electrodes (Bockris et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2000</xref>). For the sake of simplicity, all 120 electrodes were activated simultaneously by connecting them in parallel rather than using a long and tedious but more controlled serial process. This approach, may however, lead to an inhomogeneous current density, so that the degree of activation would differ from one electrode to another.</p><p>In order to study the activation, as well as the effects of aging and reactivation, a number of linear voltage sweep cycles were performed until the peak current at the sweep maximum and minimum voltage no longer increased from one cycle to the next. Four or five cycles, from 1.4 to &#x02212;1.4&#x02009;V were found necessary to achieve this condition and thence surface activation. A number of trials were required to achieve successful activation and reproducible results. After one or two cycles, micrometer sized bubbles could occasionally form on top of the electrodes as the relatively high voltage used caused electrolysis of water. Since these bubbles were found to partially mask or shield the electrodes from the electrolyte, a small plastic needle was used to establish a liquid flow on top of the electrode surface and detach the bubbles, allowing the electrode activation process to resume. In addition, because of the platinum counter/reference electrode properties, the measured sweep current was sometimes asymmetric. In order to prevent this effect a DC voltage offset (up to 0.2&#x02009;V) was used to compensate for activation currents that were too large in magnitude.</p><p>After (re)activation, the electrode arrays were rinsed carefully in PBS solution and the electrode impedance characterized using a precision impedance analyzer (4294A, Agilent, USA).</p><p>The results of the activation protocols are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, where the characteristic frequency of the electrode double layer impedance decreases by three orders of magnitude compared to inactivated electrodes (taken at 45&#x000b0; phase point), from 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;Hz. The impedance homogeneity was also found to be very high, with differences only at higher frequencies probably resulting from stray capacitances in the leads rather than from heterogeneity in electrode surface properties.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed on sets (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10) of micro electrodes</bold>.

The plots show the magnitude (upper panel) and the phase (lower panel) of the impedance of the electrode&#x02013;electrolyte interface, over the frequency range from 100&#x02009;Hz to 5&#x02009;MHz (100 sample points), with 50&#x02009;mV modulation amplitude.

Storing MEAs in a dry environment leads to a small increase in phase and impedance, by only a few percents. As expected, the electrode impedance reduced with time when MEAs were stored in PBS. After reactivation with one or two activation cycles, the original properties of the electrodes could be recovered.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (as in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), for MEAs stored dry or in PBS for 48&#x02009;h</bold>.

Although the A/D 12-bits conversion resolution (i.e. 0.052&#x02009;&#x003bc;V/level) used for detecting neuronal activity was just able to resolve the very small signal-amplitude of the noise in IrOx electrodes, the distribution of the amplitudes was Gaussian, with a standard deviation of 0.66&#x02009;&#x003bc;V (for 181 planar IrOx electrodes). These excellent features can be compared to arrays of platinum microelectrodes, fabricated using an identical process and layout.

Signals from each electrode were amplified (1200 times) and band-pass filtered (300&#x02013;3000&#x02009;Hz) with a 120-channels amplifier (Ayanda Biosystems SA, Lausanne, Switzerland). Raw signals were further sampled at 25&#x02009;kHz/channel from 120 channels simultaneously, and digitized (12-bit) through a 128-channel PCI-bus A/D card (Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) for off-line analysis.

In preliminary results we found that IrOx MEAs detected more spontaneous activity than Pt-MEAs, although a more accurate quantitative comparison requires the same brain tissue slice to be removed from one MEA and mounted on another. Such a procedure was mechanically stressful for the tissue and it was not pursued in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The extracellular spontaneous spiking activity level measured using the activated IrOx MEAs demonstrate that good results can be achieved with these planar electrodes. In general, for similar signal-to-noise ratios, 3D electrodes or platinum black electrodes have been proposed (Heuschkel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2002</xref>), although at the cost of more complicated manufacturing process (3D devices) and less reproducible results (platinum black). The high reproducibility of the IrOx impedance data across the array (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) is due to the fact that the activation process self-limits because the current density saturates after a number of cycles. Electrodeposition of Pt-black is influenced by the distribution and the current density at the electrode surface, which varies from one electrode to another as well as during the deposition process through changes of electrode surface geometry. In addition, electrodeposition of Pt-black on 120 electrodes MEAs is particularly challenging and time consuming as it requires on-line monitoring of individual currents at each electrode throughout the entire deposition process.</p><p>The storage of the IrOx electrodes in dry conditions showed that electrode properties can be preserved. On the other hand, although a reactivation process is possible, electrode degradation is considerable in PBS.</p><p>Although the study degradation process would deserve more attention, it is likely that such an electrode aging is due to the IrOx returning to a lower oxidation level thus decreasing its effective surface, as its observed correlates are fully reversible. The electrical reactivation process is not compatible with the presence of biological samples, which makes the quality of long-term monitoring (over 48&#x02009;h) dependent on the electrode ageing.</p><p>Nevertheless, measurements over shorter time windows, particularly useful in slice electrophysiology, can be achieved with acceptable electrode properties. In such a case, the array can be then daily reactivated and cleaned a number of times, to restore the original electrode properties, reusing the same MEAs a number of times.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to S.
