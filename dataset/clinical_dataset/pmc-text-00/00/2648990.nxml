However, the utilization of indicators for bacterial viability-such as the presence of specific transcripts or membrane integrity-would overcome bias introduced by cultivation and reduces the time span of analysis from initiation to read out.

Transcription of a very limited number of genes correlated with cell viability under the applied killing regime. The transcripts of the expressed genes in living bacteria &#x02013; but silent in dead bacteria-include those of essential genes encoding chaperones of the protein folding machinery and can serve as molecular biomarkers for bacterial cell viability.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Ever since the pioneering work by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch at the end of the nineteenth century, the detection of viable bacteria has been carried out by cultivation and enumeration of colony forming units (CFU). Practically all judgments on hygiene, food safety, conservation treatments, drinking water quality, infections of pathogens, efficacy of disinfectants and antibiotics are based on growth on solid agar medium followed by CFU counts. However, the assessment of cell viability on agar plates is laborious, it requires at least an overnight incubation and the outcome yields little information on bacterial physiology. Besides, the assessment of CFU counts is limited to bacteria that are readily culturable under laboratory conditions and even when they are, the failure of bacteria to reproduce on an agar plate does not necessarily imply that they are metabolically inactive or were inactive at the time of sampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>To overcome the shortcomings of CFU enumeration pointed out above, a number of alternative, cultivation-independent methods have been applied over the years to get hold of indicators for bacterial cell viability. The most commonly employed methods include fluorescence-based assays for enzymatic activity, electron transport and membrane permeability and molecular approaches for the detection of rRNA or specific mRNA molecules. The fluorescence-based assays provide signals that can be related to known cell properties, which can be assessed at the cellular rather than population level by the use of fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The molecular approaches include microarrays and real-time PCR to select and quantify specific RNA molecules. The latter methods have been generally looked upon as providing indicators of specific aspects of bacterial physiology rather than indirect measures for bacterial cell viability valid under a wide range of lethal stress conditions. However, the feasibility of cultivation-independent biomarkers under a number of well-defined conditions as indirect indicators for cell viability is still a matter of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we evaluated a number of commonly applied cultivation-independent methods under accurately defined conditions by a gradual exposure of the Gram-positive model bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis </italic>to heat stress. We systematically determined the effects of heat exposure on two cultivation-dependent measures, the ability to form colonies on agar plates, expressed in CFU counts, and outgrowth of the heat-exposed bacteria diluted in liquid cultures, expressed in the time delay to reach mid log phase. Furthermore, we determined a number of cultivation-independent measures, including the permeability of the bacterial membrane for fluorescent compounds, the stability of ribosomal RNA molecules and the presence of specific gene transcripts, as identified with microarrays and quantitative PCR methods. The results presented here reveal clear correlations between viability and cultivation-independent indicators in <italic>B. subtilis </italic>exposed to lethal heat stress. Notably, the genome wide expression profiles of heat-exposed <italic>B. subtilis </italic>reveal a coherent transcriptional program including known heat shock responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and the rapid expression of sporulation and competence genes, the latter only known to be expressed in the stationary growth phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

Immediate quenching of metabolic activity in the samples was performed with cold methanol, according to described methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Briefly, 40-ml culture samples were sprayed in 160-ml of a stirred solution of 60% methanol, 66.7 mM HEPES, pH 6.5 that was kept at &#x02013; 45&#x000b0;C in an ethanol bath. Besides RNA-isolations, the heat-treated cultures were directly subjected to outgrowth analysis to monitor the recovery time and flow cytometric analysis, as further described below. The outgrowth was carried out in 10&#x000d7; dilution series by OD measurements in time at 37&#x000b0;C in TSB by use of the Microbiology Reader Bioscreen C (Oy Growth Curves Ab Ltd, Finland).

As such comparisons require strictly defined conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], we carefully selected conditions allowing for a precise and reproducible monitoring of the transition between viable and nonviable bacteria. Throughout this study we consider the definition for viability identical to that for culturability, as justified for readily culturable bacteria such as <italic>B. subtilis </italic>(see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] for an extensive discussion on definitions for bacterial cell viability). Lethal heat stress was applied to <italic>B. subtilis </italic>in a tightly controlled manner in order to obtain a well-defined and gradual transition from viable to nonviable cells. First, the temperature sensitivity was investigated for <italic>B. subtilis </italic>cells exposed to a wide range of temperature treatments. Batch cultures of <italic>B. subtilis </italic>cells incubated at a number of constant temperatures indicate that growth still occurs up to 54&#x000b0;C, while no growth was observed at temperatures higher or equal to 56&#x000b0;C (data not shown). Next, we selected a lethal incubation temperature of 65&#x000b0;C based on CFU counts, which allows monitoring the transition from a living to a heat-inactivated bacterial cell culture within 15 minutes. The experimental set-up included the transfer of a shake flask containing a bacterial cell culture from 30 to a 65&#x000b0;C water bath. The temperature in the shake flask was continuously monitored as a function of time and samples were taken at predefined temperatures in the range from 30 to 62&#x000b0;C over a total time span of 12 minutes for all cultivation-dependent and independent analyses described throughout this study. The temperature profile as well as the exact time at which the samples have been collected for further analyses has been indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of lethal temperature treatment</bold>.

At temperatures above 57&#x000b0;C significant loss of cell viability was observed, including a reduction of almost 1 log unit at 58&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) and more dramatic reductions of 3, 4 and 6 log units at 59, 60 and 62&#x000b0;C, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The heat injury of bacterial cells may lead to relatively long recovery times before colonies appear. Thus, we carried out CFU counts after 24, 72 and 84 hours of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C. The counts at 72 and 84 hours did indicate in some cases increased levels, but did not exceed more than 10% of the initial CFU count at 24 hours (data not shown). Therefore, we further neglected the slight underestimation of CFU counts at 24 hours and used the 24 hour-counts throughout the study. We checked whether the death rate of the 1A1 laboratory strain was representative for the <italic>B. subtilis </italic>species by testing the <italic>B. subtilis </italic>natural isolates A163 and MC85 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

of vegetative cells, showing spore fractions ranging from 0 to 0.0001 (data not shown), too low to interfere with the studies described here.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table

triplicate by monitoring the time delay in reaching the mid log phase (OD wideband = 0.5) compared to the 30&#x000b0;C-control sample. Small increases in the average lag time were observed (0.2 and 0.8 hours) for temperature exposures of 40 and 50&#x000b0;C (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). However, their significance remains uncertain as standard deviations for observed lag times ranged from 0.2 to 1.5 hours. A more drastic and significant change in the lag time of approximately 4 hours occurred at a temperature of 57&#x000b0;C, while at this temperature no significant loss of CFU was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Apparently, the cells are able to fully recover from temperature treatments up to 57&#x000b0;C during an extended incubation in growth medium at 37&#x000b0;C. For more stringent temperature treatments in the range of 58 to 62&#x000b0;C the lag time ranged from 8 to 12 hours (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The relatively large increase in lag time from 4 to 8 hours for temperature treatments of 57 and 58&#x000b0;C coincides with the first loss of CFU at the latter temperature. Thus, for temperatures from 40 to 57&#x000b0;C the increase in lag time exclusively results from cellular recovery processes, while the increase in lag time at 58&#x000b0;C and higher results from both cellular recovery processes as well as the loss of viable cells in the culture. These results clearly show that the time delay to reach the mid log phase is a more sensitive measure to assess the effect of a heat exposure than CFU counts.</p></sec><sec><title>Membrane integrity</title><p>The effect of heat on <italic>B. subtilis </italic>cells was also studied with a number of cultivation-independent methods, including the fluorescence-based BacLight kit (Molecular Probes Inc.). This kit employs two nucleic acid stains, the green-fluorescent SYTO9 and the red-fluorescent propidium iodide stain, which differ in their ability to permeate bacterial cells. The cellular membrane is in general permeable to SYTO9, while propidium iodide penetrates only bacteria with damaged membranes. Propidium iodide reduces SYTO9 fluorescence when both dyes are present together. Thus, bacteria with intact membranes fluoresce green, while bacteria with damaged membranes fluoresce red [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Microscopic inspection confirmed that this system can be applied to stain heat-exposed <italic>B. subtilis </italic>cells (data not shown). However, we found that the fluorescence of the SYTO9 fluorescent dye was relatively unstable under the conditions used, as the green fluorescence signal slowly decayed, while the fluorescence of the propidium iodide dye remained stable. Therefore, we subjected bacteria that were stained only with propidium iodide to flow-cytometric analysis. A calibration curve of mixtures of living and heat-killed bacteria (10 min at 96&#x000b0;C) showed a perfectly linear correlation between the percentage of heat-exposed bacterial cells (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100%) and the number of events with relatively high red fluorescence intensity (data not shown). The heat-exposed bacterial cell samples were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow-cytometry. The three-dimensional representation in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> shows the number of cells plotted as a function of fluorescence intensity in the red FL4 channel for each temperature treatment. Clearly, the heat-induced decrease of non-fluorescent cells coincides with an increase of membrane-permeable red-fluorescent cells all with Gaussian-shaped population distributions. The effect is most prominent at 62&#x000b0;C (apart from the control experiment at 96&#x000b0;C), at which 25% of the cell population is permeable to the propidium iodide dye. A comparison of CFU counts with data from propidium iodide stained bacteria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, C</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) shows that the membrane integrity is a much more insensitive measure for the applied heat regime than the ability to form colonies. In the range of 59&#x02013;62&#x000b0;C the majority of bacteria do still contain an intact membrane, while more than 99.9% of these bacteria lost their ability to form colonies. Apparently, heat-induced cell death precedes the loss of membrane integrity.</p></sec><sec><title>Ribosomal RNA stability</title><p>In order to study the effect of extreme heat stress at a molecular level, we evaluated the heat stability of 16S and 23S rRNA molecules. The heat stability of total RNA isolations from bacterial cells was assessed in a number of independent experiments by the use of the 2100 Electrophoresis Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The 16S/23S ratios indicated in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> were calculated from the integrated peak intensities. The temperature treatments in the range from 30&#x02013;62&#x000b0;C did not result in systematic changes in the total yield of RNA as determined by 260 nm OD measurements (data not shown), but the electrophoresis patterns clearly indicated that heat-induced degradation of 16S rRNA starts at exposures from 50&#x000b0;C. However, the 23S rRNA appears resistant against the heat treatment over the entire temperature range up to 62&#x000b0;C, evident from the discrete bands of the same intensity over the entire temperature range (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The levels of 16S rRNA decreased to less than 10% of the 23S rRNA level (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The appearance of faint but discrete bands in the range from 50&#x02013;62&#x000b0;C at molecular weight positions lower than that of the 16S rRNA transcript suggests that heat-induced degradation of this RNA molecule occurs at least partly through breakage at preferential sites. In addition, the 5S rRNA molecule seems quite heat stable, since a discrete band remains present throughout the temperature treatment. Prolonged heat treatments at temperatures higher than 62&#x000b0;C led to complete degradation of ribosomal RNA, including 23S rRNA, and eventually also DNA (data now shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Electrophoretic analysis of total RNA extracts</bold>.

Labelled cDNA probes of the temperature of interest (Cy5-labelled) and the 30&#x000b0;C reference temperature (Cy3-labelled) were mixed for every hybridization experiment. Independent heat-exposure experiments were carried out to obtain replicates. Besides, experiments were carried out with RNA isolated from two <italic>B. subtilis </italic>food product isolates (A163 and MC85) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). All data were expressed as <sup>2</sup>log ratios of treatment and reference. The data processing filters (for details see Materials and Methods) did not result in a systematic loss of data points (number of genes with useful ratios) upon increasing temperatures. First, a k-means clustering analysis &#x02013; a procedure to classify a given data set through a certain number of clusters (assume k clusters) fixed a priori [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] &#x02013; was applied to study the global behaviour of gene transcripts during the heat exposure from 30 to 62&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We found that clustering with a minimum of 4 groups of genes leads to a representative description of global gene expression behaviour. Three of the gene clusters each cover approximately 30% the expression data and show decreased transcript levels at elevated temperatures decaying at similar decay rates, but starting to decrease from 50, 57 and 60&#x000b0;C, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This major part of transcript ratios (88%) decreases to values below <sup>2</sup>log values of -5 at elevated temperatures as a result of the heat treatment. The remaining 12% of the transcripts representing the fourth cluster is induced from 50&#x000b0;C and still present at reference or elevated levels, even under conditions where cell viability has been completely lost.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>K-means clustering of genome-wide expressiondata</bold>.

In the first, described in this paragraph, we selected for large, temperature-responsive, unregulated clusters of genes, while in the second strategy, described in the next paragraph, we evaluated the average expression level of genes known to be under control of a common transcriptional regulator. The identification of interconnected gene clusters, behaving in a similar manner in terms of expression profiles, can be very informative in bacteria, as functionally related genes are often in close proximity of each other and co-transcribed in polycistronic transcripts. All 4100 open reading frames were sorted in the order present on the <italic>B. subtilis </italic>genome (from the first ORF <italic>dnaA </italic>at 0.4 kb from the origin of replication to the last ORF <italic>rpmH </italic>at 4214.4 kb) and their <sup>2</sup>log expression ratios were represented over a total of 12 columns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Each of 8 subcolumns within a column represents a different temperature exposure, from the reference temperature of 30&#x000b0;C to the final temperature of 62&#x000b0;C, indicated by the upper horizontal bars from blue to red. The 10 largest interconnected gene clusters (letters a &#x02013; j), containing the highest average heat-induced gene expression ratios, were identified in Excel by iterative smoothing of <sup>2</sup>log ratios over the genome (window size: 8) of the average of the 6 gene expression levels from 50 to 62&#x000b0;C. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> these 10 clusters are isolated from their genome context and presented in more detail. The gene clusters include (a) the class III heat shock operon (b) a stretch of 67 ORFs containing at least 47 genes encoding ribosomal proteins, (c) the surfactin biosynthesis operon/competence genes, (d) the mobile genetic element ICEbsl, (e) an operon involved in sugar/carbohydrate metabolism, (f) an operon encoding inner spore coat proteins, (g) the pyrimidine biosynthesis operon, (h) the class I heat shock operon, (i) the L-arabinose operon and (j) the operon involved in myo-inositol catabolism.

This type of analysis was carried out with T-profiler, a tool that uses the <italic>t</italic>-test to score changes in the average activity of genes under control of transcription factors, including &#x003c3;-factors and other known activators and repressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this study we used the DBTBS database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], containing a collection of 116 experimentally validated transcription factors and 1253 gene regulatory relations, to evaluate the role of these regulators during the applied heat regime. The first and largest pre-defined group of genes (average over a total of 660 genes) up regulated at elevated temperatures consists of the genes under control of the house-keeping sigma factor &#x003c3;<sup>A </sup>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This is in agreement with its control by a heat sensitive promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, three classes of heat shock genes have been identified. We found the induction of the heat shock stimulon, consisting of the major class I, II and III heat shock regulons, under control of the regulators HrcA, &#x003c3;<sup>B </sup>and CtsR, respectively. The &#x003c3;<sup>B </sup>or general stress response transiently peaked at 50&#x000b0;C, while the overall expression of the HrcA and CtsR regulons remained fairly constant after induction over the entire heat regime (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>T-profile analysis of transcription regulons</bold>.

Notably, the response induced at the lowest temperature, already maximal at 40&#x000b0;C, includes the expression of genes under control of &#x003c3;<sup>D</sup>, the transcription factor for motility. This response is only present at 40&#x02013;50&#x000b0;C; it involves among others the <italic>fla/che </italic>operon, the <italic>lytA-C </italic>genes for autolysis and genes encoding methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins <italic>mcpA</italic>-<italic>B</italic>. Surprisingly, the heat-induced transcriptional response also includes a number of sporulation and competence genes, described in more detail below. One of the most prominent responses at high temperature was the derepression of large regulons involved in carbon metabolism, controlled by the CcpA (average of 109 genes), AraR (regulator of the arabinose operon; average of 12 genes) and IolR (regulator of the inositol metabolism; average of 13 genes) transcription factors. Note that both the inositol and arabinose operons are controlled by CcpA, a global regulator that directs the carbon flow (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>In order to clarify the T-values obtained for an interesting sub-set of the regulons described above, we depicted the <sup>2</sup>log ratios for a number of representative genes, which are part of the regulons for the heat shock responses, sporulation and competence development in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. For reference, the <sup>2</sup>log ratios have been indicated showing the heat-induction of 4 representative genes of the HrcA, &#x003c3;<sup>B </sup>and CtsR heat shock regulons, also described in a large number of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Next, the ratios for 4 representative genes of regulons controlled by 3 sporulation transcription factors have been depicted. The transcriptional program for sporulation includes an asymmetric cell division and takes approximately 8 hours under laboratory conditions. During the process of sporulation, groups of genes are sequentially activated and silenced, representing distinct intermediate developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. There are 4 known sporulation specific sigma factors, &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>F</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>G </sup>and &#x003c3;<sup>K </sup>that cascade sequential and compartment-specific gene expression in mother cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and forespore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The &#x003c3;<sup>F </sup>factor becomes active only in the forespore and &#x003c3;<sup>E </sup>only in the mother cell, followed by &#x003c3;<sup>G </sup>and &#x003c3;<sup>K</sup>, respectively. The timing of &#x003c3;<sup>F </sup>is controlled by the SpoIIAA/AB/E regulatory system. In this study, we observed the rapid heat-induced induction of genes under control of &#x003c3;<sup>F</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>E </sup>and &#x003c3;<sup>K </sup>on a time-scale of minutes rather than hours. The observed transcriptional response involved the up regulation of only a minor, but significant part of the sporulation genes, with a sequence of gene activation matching that of the normal sporulation program in the mother cell. Up regulated genes under regulation of sporulation transcription factors include the &#x003c3;<sup>F</sup>-controlled genes <italic>bofC</italic>, <italic>csfB</italic>, <italic>arsB</italic>, <italic>gerAA </italic>and <italic>spoIIR </italic>and a number of genes under the dual control of &#x003c3;<sup>B </sup>and &#x003c3;<sup>F</sup>. Interestingly, the <italic>spoIIR </italic>gene product is a signaling molecule that presumably activates the SpoIIGA protease leading to the processing of pro-&#x003c3;<sup>E </sup>into &#x003c3;<sup>E </sup>in the mother cell.

In addition, we checked expression effects of the same gene in null mutants of the heat-activated, general stress response sigma factor &#x003c3;<sup>B </sup>and the motility transcription factor &#x003c3;<sup>D </sup>(negative control). The results in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> clearly show that the heat-induced expression of <italic>cotJA </italic>is dependent on the presence of sporulation-specific sigma factors &#x003c3;<sup>F </sup>and &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, but not on the sigma factors &#x003c3;<sup>B</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>D </sup>and &#x003c3;<sup>K</sup>. These results are in line with the current model for the sporulation program, including the control of <italic>cotJA </italic>by &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, which is in turn activated by an &#x003c3;<sup>F</sup>-controlled gene, while &#x003c3;<sup>K </sup>plays a role in the signalling cascade further downstream.

The application of cultivation-independent methods as an alternative to assess bacterial viability is highly valuable for a number of reasons. A rapid measurement of the physiological state of the bacterium indicating whether it survived a certain processing condition (heat, high pressure, antimicrobial compounds) would save enormous amount of time and labour, currently lost in the classical routine of plating and counting. The timely and laborious plating method renders high-throughput screenings an almost impossible mission, although the recently reported miniaturization of the culture plate to a micro-Petri dish holds great promise for the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Any cultivation-based method results by definition in an estimate of the survivors <italic>after </italic>a treatment under predefined growth conditions, which are usually very different from those present during the actual processing conditions. A rapid measurement of the physiological state of the bacterium would be beneficial, as it reflects the direct cellular response towards processing conditions and could yield information on the successful survival strategy of the bacterium. This could allow a rational design for preferred adaptations in processing conditions aimed at a more efficient bacterial inactivation for harmful microbes or survival for beneficial ones.</p><p>The need for cultivation-independent methods to assess bacterial cell viability is most evident when microbes only grow in their natural habitat and colony formation is absent or extremely slow in any of the available growth media. Likewise, the enumeration of colonies is not applicable for bacteria present in dense populations of multiple species for which no selective media are available. In those cases the highly selective PCR-based assessment of specific gene transcripts, as further discussed below, can be applied to assess cell viability of one bacterial species in a complex population.</p><p>The workflow in this study starts from the assessment of bacterial viability upon exposure to a lethal heat treatment with conventional methods, including the enumeration of colonies, the determination of outgrowth curves and the widely used dead/live stain in the <italic>Bac</italic>Light kit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These experiments set a clear reference for molecular studies discussed below and roughly establish the 40 to 57&#x000b0;C temperature regime as inhibitory and sub-lethal, as judged from the extension in the lag phase and CFU counts (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The membrane integrity as judged from the dead/live stain is clearly a less sensitive indicator for the subtle heat regime applied here than colony enumeration or lag phase extension (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), but more stringent temperature treatments do lead to a 100% dead (propidium-iodide permeable) cell population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><p>The electrophoretic analysis of total RNA extracts clearly indicates a much higher heat tolerance of 23S rRNA molecule for the applied heat regime than 16S rRNA molecule, as one can assume that constant level of 23S rRNA cannot exclusively result from higher 23S rRNA synthesis rates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The difference in heat susceptibility of 23S and 16S rRNA molecules is commonly observed among prokaryotes, including <italic>B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus </italic>and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The results clearly show that <italic>B. subtilis </italic>is able to fully recover from the observed heat-induced rRNA degradation, as significant cell death only occurs from 58&#x000b0;C exposures, while a major part of 16S rRNA has been degraded at 57&#x000b0;C (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Therefore, the level of 16S rRNA is not a very good indicator for cell viability under these conditions.</p><p>A representation of the overall behaviour of mRNA transcripts during the heat treatment shows a great variability in expression levels of genes, with the majority of transcripts completely degraded at higher temperatures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), the time-lapse movie of heat-induced expression profiles). An overview of all the gene expression levels ordered according to the corresponding gene position on the circular <italic>B. subtilis </italic>genome allowed the selection of 10 major clusters of gene transcripts, which were highly up regulated and most of them stable over the entire heat regime from 50&#x02013;62&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The identified gene clusters matched many of those identified by the T-profile analysis, which uses pre-defined groups of genes known to be co-regulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Strikingly, there is one very large cluster of genes, which show very similar transcription levels during the entire heat treatment (cluster b, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These transcripts are encoded by a stretch of 67 ORFs containing at least 47 ribosomal protein genes. Apparently, the regulation and stability of the transcripts encoded by these house-keeping genes is such that they remain more or less constant during the applied heat regime, in accordance with their essential function in protein synthesis.</p><p>In addition, gene clusters were identified containing the classic heat shock operons class I and class III (h, a, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), while the class II heat shock or &#x003c3;<sup>B </sup>regulon was only identified in the T-profile analysis as a result of the widespread distribution of genes from this regulon over the genome. The cluster of genes known to be highly induced upon stress is the mobile genetic element ICEbs1, which up regulation occurs upon global DNA damage (cluster d) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This fact and the up regulation of the cluster of pyrimidine genes (cluster g) may be part of the cell's response towards heat-induced DNA damage. The gene clusters (e, i, j) which are all involved in catabolic carbon metabolism may indicate the cell's attempt to deal with energy stress and generate ATP. Most surprising is the up regulation of a number of genes, known to be involved in stationary phase processes sporulation (cluster f) and competence development (cluster c). As their activation is usually strictly controlled by dedicated transcription regulators, we tested whether the observed up regulation of inner spore coat genes (<italic>cotJ </italic>operon) is dependent on sporulation-specific transcription factors. We confirmed that the heat-induced expression of the <italic>cotJ </italic>operon is dependent on <italic>sigF </italic>and <italic>sigE</italic>, but not on <italic>sigK </italic>genes, in agreement with the current model of the sporulation signal transduction cascade (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). The activation of the sporulation sigma factors is normally coupled to the course of morphogenesis during spore differentiation. It is not clear at this point what mechanism causes the heat-induced short-cut in part of the sporulation program and whether the expressed gene products play an alternative role in heat resistance of the mother cell.</p><p>The observed cellular responses suggest that heat stress causes a wide variety of physiological stress. Which type of damage leads to cell death is not clear, but the microarray data indicate that the transcriptional machinery is at least still intact in cells that completely lost the ability to reproduce. This can be concluded from the results that show increasing transcript levels of most genes in the clusters a-j at temperatures from 58&#x02013;62&#x000b0;C, whereas the majority of the cells died at these temperatures (compare Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>Expression levels in living and dead cells were further validated by quantitative PCR to assess <italic>gspA</italic>, <italic>dnaK </italic>and <italic>cotJ </italic>transcript levels in <italic>B. subtilis </italic>cells exposed to the heat regime in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The results in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> further substantiate the conclusions derived from the microarray results. The transcript levels of <italic>cotJA </italic>keep on increasing over the entire heat regime, which is most likely resulting from transcriptional activity up to 62&#x000b0;C. The SigB controlled <italic>gspA </italic>expression profile occurs as a highly induced, transient response, peaking at 50&#x000b0;C in line with the microarray data. The <italic>dnaK </italic>transcription levels are induced to a smaller extent, but from a much higher reference level at 30&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Transcription level validation with quantitative PCR</bold>.

We selected a set of 4 genes, all under the control of the HrcA regulator, which matched these criteria; they include <italic>grpE</italic>, <italic>dnaK</italic>, <italic>groES </italic>and <italic>groEL </italic>(see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). We observed that the above criteria for expression levels of these genes also matched in microarray studies on other bacterial species, where the cause of death was different: <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum </italic>exposed to ultra high-pressure treatments and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>exposed to biocides (data not shown).</p><p>Both <italic>dnak </italic>and <italic>groE </italic>operons are preceded by a SigA-type promoter, which ensures transcription of these genes under growth conditions without stress (in line with the <italic>dnaK </italic>expression levels in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), as protein folding is also needed under these conditions. A fascinating question involves the mechanism for the reproducible rapid decrease of these transcripts in bacteria that lost the ability to grow. In living bacteria, the CIRCE element (controlling inverted repeat of chaperone expression), located between the transcriptional and translational start sites of both <italic>dnaK </italic>and <italic>groESL </italic>operons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], is involved in the regulation of both operons. In the current model the GroE chaperonin, the activator of the HrcA repressor, which binds to CIRCE, is titrated away in the presence of unfolded proteins in an ATP-dependent process, leading to inactivation of HrcA and enhancement of transcription of <italic>dnaK </italic>and <italic>groESL </italic>operons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, the down regulation or degradation of these transcripts in excess of unfolded proteins asks for an extension of this model. No matter what regulatory mechanisms, the identification of 4 transcripts of chaperone genes as biomarker for viability needs to be further validated for a wide range of environmental conditions to determine the lethal conditions for which they are bona fide.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study contains a systematic comparison between cultivation-based assessment of cell viability and cultivation-independent indicators for cell viability by sampling and analyzing heat-exposed <italic>B. subtilis </italic>cells going through the transition from culturable to unculturable cells. Accordingly, some viability indicators appear more sensitive than the conventional enumeration of colony forming units (CFU's), while others appear less sensitive measures: during heat stress the extension of lag time for outgrowth, the degradation of 16S rRNA and the induction of classic heat shock genes precede the loss of CFU's, while the loss of membrane permeability and the degradation of 23S rRNA occur after the loss of CFU's. The genome-wide transcriptional response indicates that heat stress causes a wide variety of physiological stresses. Which type or types of cell damage lead to cell death is not clear, but the microarray data indicate that the transcriptional machinery is at least still intact, as a subset of genes is still expressed in cells that lost the ability to reproduce.</p><p>The heat-induced transcriptional program includes known heat shock responses as well as the rapid expression of a small number of sporulation and competence genes, the latter only known to be active in the stationary growth phase. Further research needs to assess whether the activation of a small number of genes in these well-studied developmental programs is a result of deregulation due to heat damage or a meaningful, physiological event fitting in the cell's strategy to cope with heat stress. Notably, the transcription of a limited number of genes correlated with cell viability under the applied killing regime. The transcripts of the expressed genes in living bacteria &#x02013; but silent in dead &#x02013; include those of essential genes encoding chaperones of the protein folding machinery and may serve as molecular biomarkers for bacterial cell viability.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FHS and RM developed the initial concept for this study.

The time-lapse movie of expression profiles was constructed by the use of Windows Movie Maker version 5.1 (Microsoft Inc.). All genes were sorted in the gene order present on the <italic>B. subtilis </italic>genome and presented in 32 columns of 96 genes each. Only those genes that contained a detectable transcription level at 30&#x000b0;C were analyzed. This filter led to a total of 75% of the genes (3072 out of 4100 genes). The 29 frames used for the movie consist of 8 measurements from 0&#x02013;12 minutes and 21 interpolations. The parameters time, temperature and CFU counts were inserted in the microarray images, which were generated with the TIGR MultiExperimentViewer version 4.0.01. The <sup>2</sup>log ratios were colour-coded, ranging from -3 (green) to +3 (red). Note that there is one region throughout the whole series of profiles with nearly identical expression levels to the reference profile at 30&#x000b0;C. This region contains 67 ORFs from <italic>rplK </italic>to <italic>rpsL </italic>and encodes at least 47 different ribosomal proteins.</p></caption><media xlink:href="1471-2164-9-590-S1.WMV" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"><caption><p>Click here for file</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Stanley Brul, Adriano Henriques and Daniel Kearns for generous strain donations.
