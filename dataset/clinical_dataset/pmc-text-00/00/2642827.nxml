We thus performed full genome analyses on four <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, including human and food isolates from both a 1988 case of sporadic listeriosis and a 2000 listeriosis outbreak, which had been linked to contaminated food from a single processing facility. All four isolates had been shown to have identical subtypes, suggesting that a specific <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>strain persisted in this processing plant over at least 12 years. While a genome sequence for the 1988 food isolate has been reported, we sequenced the genomes of the 1988 human isolate as well as a human and a food isolate from the 2000 outbreak to allow for comparative genome analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The two <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>isolates from 1988 and the two isolates from 2000 had highly similar genome backbone sequences with very few single nucleotide (nt) polymorphisms (1 &#x02013; 8 SNPs/isolate; confirmed by re-sequencing). While no genome rearrangements were identified in the backbone genome of the four isolates, a 42 kb prophage inserted in the chromosomal <italic>comK </italic>gene showed evidence for major genome rearrangements. The human-food isolate pair from each 1988 and 2000 had identical prophage sequence; however, there were significant differences in the prophage sequences between the 1988 and 2000 isolates. Diversification of this prophage appears to have been caused by multiple homologous recombination events or possibly prophage replacement. In addition, only the 2000 human isolate contained a plasmid, suggesting plasmid loss or acquisition events. Surprisingly, besides the polymorphisms found in the <italic>comK </italic>prophage, a single SNP in the tRNA Thr-4 prophage represents the only SNP that differentiates the 1988 isolates from the 2000 isolates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data support the hypothesis that the 2000 human listeriosis outbreak was caused by a <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>strain that persisted in a food processing facility over 12 years and show that genome sequencing is a valuable and feasible tool for retrospective epidemiological analyses. Short-term evolution of <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>in non-controlled environments appears to involve limited diversification beyond plasmid gain or loss and prophage diversification, highlighting the importance of phages in bacterial evolution.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Experimentally evolved lineages of bacteria have provided important data on mechanisms involved in short-term bacterial evolution and adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] in simple controlled environments. However, experiments in controlled environments cannot represent all forces contributing to evolution in non-controlled settings and natural environments. Important differences between experimental and natural bacterial populations include (i) population sizes that are much greater in experimental populations than in a natural population; (ii) generation times that are probably much shorter in an experimental population than in a natural population; and (iii) absence of donors of genetic materials, which allow for rapid diversification via horizontal gene transfer (e.g., other bacteria, bacteriophages). In addition, while experimental populations experience selective pressures that are usually low in number but high in intensity, natural populations encounter many selective pressures imposed by physical (e.g., temperature), chemical (e.g., pH), and biological (e.g., phages and other microbial organisms) variables, which differ in intensity and vary over time. The strong selective pressure provided by controlled environments often results in parallel evolution of replicates under the same conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For example, 12 <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>populations that originated from the same parent strain all showed substitutions in the same candidate genes after they were cultured for 20,000 generations under identical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p><italic>Listeria monocytogenes </italic>is a gram-positive, facultative intracellular foodborne pathogen that causes listeriosis in humans and many mammalian and avian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Human listeriosis is a rare but severe disease; an estimated 2,500 human invasive listeriosis cases including 500 deaths occur annually in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The vast majority of human listeriosis cases are caused by foodborne transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A common source of food contamination appears to be transmission of <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>present in processing plant environments to food products after they have been heat processed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>is ubiquitously distributed in the environment. It can grow under a wide range of environmental conditions, including temperatures ranging from 0.4&#x000b0;C to 45&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and pH ranging from 4 to 9.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Consequently, it is difficult to control <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>in food processing environments. Although food processing facilities and equipment are regularly cleaned and sanitized, persistence of specific <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>subtypes, over time periods ranging from a few months to more than five years, has been documented for a number of food processing facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>It is also common for several <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>subtypes to co-exist in the same food processing facility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. While use of molecular subtyping methods, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), has been critical in listeriosis outbreak investigations and surveillance, interpretation of subtyping data sometimes remains a challenge as isolates may diversify rapidly (e.g., due to plasmid losses, yielding different PFGE patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]) and as epidemiologically unrelated strains may share identical PFGE patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Consequently, there is a need to better understand <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>diversification in non-controlled environments and to develop improved subtyping approaches that can be used in follow-up studies to routine subtyping using PFGE.</p><p>In 1988, a sporadic case of human listeriosis in Oklahoma, USA was linked to the consumption of <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>contaminated turkey franks produced in a food processing facility in Texas, USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Twelve years later, in 2000, a multi-state listeriosis outbreak, which caused illnesses in 29 persons in 11 US states (including 4 deaths), was linked to consumption of deli turkey meat produced in the same processing facility that was linked to the 1988 listeriosis case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Phenotypic and genotypic typing showed that human and food isolates from both episodes belonged to the same serotype (1/2a), were slow rhamnose fermenters (a rare phenotype for 1/2a isolates), and were indistinguishable by ribotyping (all isolates were ribotype DUP-1053A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]) and PFGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The PFGE type for these isolates (type 25, as reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]) was only found once among a set of 495 <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>isolates previously characterized by PFGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], indicating that this specific strain represents a combination of genetic and phenotypic characteristics that is rare. While re-introduction of this strain in the processing plant from the outside environment represents a possibility, the rarity of this strain and the fact that ready-to-eat food processing plants typically implement practices to prevent introduction of microbial organisms suggests that persistence of a single <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>strain in this facility for at least 12 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] is the most likely explanation for the observations detailed above. The genome sequence of a food isolate (F6854) from the 1988 episode has previously been determined using automated Sanger sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We sequenced the genome of the corresponding human isolate from the 1988 episode as well as the genomes of a human and a food isolate from the 2000 outbreak. Sequence comparisons of these genomes enabled us to characterize <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>evolution during short-term survival in a non-controlled non-host environment and to determine the value of full genome sequencing as a subtyping approach in follow-up studies to outbreak investigations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Genome sequencing of three <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>isolates by 454 pyrosequencing</title><p>The human isolate from the 1988 listeriosis case (F6900) and a human (J0161) and a food (J2818) isolate from the 2000 multi-state listeriosis outbreak in the US (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were sequenced using the 454 GS20 Genome Sequencer (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT), which uses the "sequencing by synthesis" technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

This plasmid represented two non-overlapping contigs of 69,915 bp and 12,763 bp. These two plasmid contigs showed a very high level of nucleotide identity (&#x0003e;99%) with pLM80, an approx. 80 kb plasmid previously reported in the serotype 4b (lineage I) strain H7858 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The two plasmid contigs included all 95 ORFs previously identified in pLM80 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Genes found in the plasmid contigs included at least 11 genes annotated as transposon genes in pLM80 and two genes associated with cadmium resistance. The observation that this plasmid was only sequenced in the 2000 human isolate (J0161) suggests either a loss of the plasmid in the other isolates (during propagation in the food processing plant, the food or the human host for the 1988 isolate or during isolation) or an acquisition of this plasmid in the 2000 human isolate.</p></sec><sec><title>Genome alignment and polymorphism analyses</title><p>To identify genomic differences between the human and food isolate from the 1988 case as well as a food and human isolate from the 2000 outbreak, we aligned the 4 genomes using TBA (Threaded-Blockset Aligner) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and refined this alignment using MUSCLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The refined alignment of the four genomes had a total length of 2,922,773 bp (including gaps) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The aligned sequences for each genome ranged from 2,921,243 to 2,921,655 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). As between 1.2% and 1.7% of the genome sequences for each isolate could not be included in the alignment, it is possible that the four isolates contain some differences in addition to those detailed below. Regions not included in the alignment most likely represent regions not sequenced in one or more genomes, deletions/insertions, or genome fragments replaced by a non-homologous sequence (i.e., within the <italic>comK </italic>prophage). Specifically, while the length of the <italic>comK </italic>prophage sequence ranged from 38,876 to 42,001 bases in the four isolates (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), the <italic>comK </italic>prophage alignment (including gaps) was only 28,886 bp, indicating extensive diversification including presence of non-homologous prophage sequences in the different isolates (as described in detail below). This difference represents 25% of the non-aligned sequences in the whole genome alignment, although this prophage represents less than 2% of the genome size.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Circular map of genomes analyzed</bold>.

Among the eight polymorphisms specific to the 2000 food isolate (J2818, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), three fall in intergenic regions and five fall in coding sequences, including one representing a synonymous change and four representing nonsynonymous changes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).

Nine isolates with ribotype DUP-1053A (representing the ribotype of the 1988 and 2000 food and human isolates) obtained between August and November of 2000 from human clinical cases in Ohio, Michigan and New York were found to be slow rhamnose-fermenters. These isolates were also found, by PFGE using <italic>Apa</italic>I and <italic>Asc</italic>I for restriction of DNA, to be indistinguishable from each other and from the 1988 and 2000 human and food isolates sequenced. As these results strongly suggested that these nine isolates were from humans that were infected as part of the 2000 outbreak, we screened these isolates for the 12 confirmed polymorphisms identified among the genome sequences for the human and food isolates from the 1988 case and the 2000 outbreak as well as for the presence of two plasmid-specific sequences. All 9 isolates were positive by PCR for both plasmid sequences, indicating that the plasmid found in J0161 is present in most other human isolates associated with this outbreak. None of these nine human isolates had any of the polymorphisms specific to F6900 (1988 human isolate) or J2818 (2000 food isolate).</p><p>Furthermore, none of the nine isolates shared the one SNP specific to the subculture of the 2000 human isolate (J0161) that was sequenced at Broad (SNP 3; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), but that was not found in the J0161 subculture that was used for re-sequencing at Cornell, supporting the hypothesis that this polymorphism arose during laboratory passage of the J0161 subculture sequenced at Broad. Nevertheless, all nine human isolates showed (i) nt sequences identical to J0161 (the sequenced 2000 human isolate) at the eight sites that carry unique SNPs in the 2000 food isolate (J2818), (ii) the SNP unique to the 2000 human isolate J0161 (SNP 2; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) as well as (iii) the tRNA Thr-4 prophage SNP (SNP 12; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) that differentiates the 1988 isolates from the 2000 isolates. SNP 2 thus does not represent a random mutation unique to the sequenced human isolate from the 2000 outbreak (e.g., mutation that arose during passage or infection), but was found in all human clinical isolates surveyed from this outbreak.</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular growth assays of the 2000 human and food isolates</title><p>While it is unlikely that any of the few nonsynonymous substitutions observed would affect the fitness of <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>strains tested here, we performed preliminary experiments to test whether the nonsynonymous sites differentiating the 2000 human and food isolates (may affect the ability of the 2000 human and food isolates to multiply inside macrophage cells. We specifically surmised that the nonconservative Trp &#x02192; Cys change in <italic>addB </italic>(i.e., SNP 10, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) could alter the function of the enzyme AddAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], which is analogous to <italic>E. coli </italic>RecBCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As RecBCD deficient <italic>E. coli </italic>mutants have been shown to be more susceptible to oxidative DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]; we hypothesized that the 2000 food and human isolates may differ in their ability to survive inside activated macrophages (i.e., J774 cells stimulated with LPS) where they may be exposed to oxidative stress. We used FSL R2-499 (a subculture of J0161 confirmed as having SNP 10 and thus encoding the same <italic>addB </italic>allelic variant as J0161) and the 2000 food isolate J2818 for these experiments. As no apparent difference in intracellular growth of these two strains was observed when the strains were initially characterized in separate intracellular growth assays (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), we performed triplicate competition experiments by infecting J774 cells with both strains simultaneously; competition assays like this typically provide for more sensitive means to identify whether one strain has a competitive advantage over another strain in a given environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In the competitive intracellular growth assay the relative recovery of both isolates after 9 h of intracellular growth did not differ significantly (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003e; 0.05; chi-square test); overall, 16 and 14 colonies, respectively, with the J2818 and the J0161 <italic>addB </italic>allelic type were recovered (3/10, 7/10, and 6/10 isolates carried the J2818 <italic>addB </italic>allelic type in replicates 1, 2, and 3, respectively). While these data suggest that the mutations that differentiate the two 2000 isolates do not affect the intracellular growth capabilities, of these isolates, in activated J774 macrophage cells, future phenotypic and animal experiments would be needed to further test whether the 2000 human and food isolate genotypes differ in their fitness. As no data on the effect of an <italic>L. monocytogenes addB </italic>null mutation are available, it is unclear which physiological functions may be affected by nonsynonymous mutations in this gene. Future experiments thus should involve characterization of an <italic>addB </italic>null mutant before conducting additional phenotypic and animal experiments to determine the effect of the observed nonsynonymous mutation in <italic>addB </italic>and/or other nonsynonymous mutations differentiating the 2000 human and food isolates.</p></sec><sec><title>Estimation of congruence between observed low mutation rate and known mutation rates in bacterial populations</title><p>Overall, we only found a single synonymous nucleotide difference (SNP 11; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) between the 2000 food isolate (J2818) and the 1988 isolates and no synonymous nucleotide difference between the 2000 human isolate (J0161) and the 1988 isolates. In order to determine whether this low number of synonymous changes is consistent with previously reported mutation rates for bacteria, we calculated the estimated number of generations between the 1988 isolates and the 2000 food isolates (J2818) using previously reported mutation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], including 3.30 &#x02013; 4.50 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-10 </sup>per bp per generation for experimental <italic>Myxococcus xanthus </italic>populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and 1.44 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-10 </sup>per bp per generation for experimental <italic>E. coli </italic>populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Ochman <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] estimated a mutation rate of 4.50 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-9 </sup>per bp per year (approximately 2.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-11 </sup>per bp per generation assuming ~200 generations per year) for natural populations of <italic>E. coli </italic>and 8.20 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-9 </sup>per bp per year (approximately 2.05 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-10 </sup>per bp per generation assuming 40 generations per year) for natural populations of <italic>Buchnera</italic>. The number of generations was calculated as the (number of synonymous substitutions, i.e., 1])/[(number of synonymous sites, i.e., 5.65 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) &#x000d7; (mutation rate)]. Using the two extremes of the suggested mutation rates (2.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-11 </sup>and 4.50 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-10 </sup>per bp per generation) we estimated that between 3,933 and 78,666 generations separated the 1988 isolates from the 2000 isolates. Assuming a 12 year time span between the two sets of isolates, these mutation rates translate into 328 and 6,556 generations per year (0.90 &#x02013; 17.96 generations per day), yielding a generation time ranging from 1.34 to 26.67 hours. The generation time estimate (1.34 h) based on the low mutation rate (2.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-11 </sup>mutations per bp per generation) proposed for natural populations of <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] is only about 2-fold longer than the estimated generation time for <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>in rich media broth at 30&#x000b0;C (0.7 h) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Other <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>generation times reported were 14.2 h (in rich-media at 4&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]) and 111.3 h (for <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>in soil exposed to temperatures fluctuating between -29&#x000b0;C to 12&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]). We thus propose that a mutation rate closer to 4.50 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-10 </sup>(as estimated from an experimental population of <italic>M. xanthus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]) is more likely to represent the mutation rate for <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, as a generation time of approx 24 &#x02013; 28 h seems plausible for <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>in natural environments. Under this mutation rate, generation time, and assuming a Poisson distribution, the probability of observing zero or one synonymous substitution is roughly the same (~36.8%), which is consistent with the observation that the 2000 food isolate (J2818) differed from the 1988 isolates by one synonymous change, while the 2000 human isolate (J0161) showed no synonymous changes as compared to the 1988 isolates. In conclusion, the low rate of mutations observed for the isolates studied here is thus clearly within the range expected based on previously reported mutation rates for other bacteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparative analyses of comK prophage sequences in the 1988 and 2000 isolates</title><p>As the <italic>comK </italic>prophage in the 2000 isolates showed considerable divergence from the <italic>comK </italic>prophage in the 1988 isolates (1,274 nt differences between the 1988 and 2000 prophage sequences), further analyses were performed on the <italic>comK </italic>prophage sequences.

Sawyer's test provided evidence for recombination among the five prophage sequences in the alignment (i.e., inner fragments, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001) as well as for recombination with sequences not included in this alignment (i.e., outer fragments, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001). Overall, five inner recombination events involving the <italic>comK </italic>prophage in the two 2000 isolates and FSL J1-194 were initially identified. Visual analysis of the prophage sequences suggests at least three independent recombination events in the two 2000 isolates, relative to the two 1988 isolates; for these three recombinant regions (marked as R1, R2, and R3 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) the prophage sequences in two 2000 isolates were more similar to FSL J1-194 than to the prophage sequences in the two 1988 isolates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

These deletions and replacements in the 2000 isolates are likely consequences of recombination events that integrated or replaced large sequences, as supported by the observation that some observed gene deletions or replacements were located in large recombinant fragments identified by Sawyer's test. For example, the eight adjacent genes LMOf6854_2352.2 to LMOf6854_2360.1 found in the 1988 isolates appear to have been replaced by a block of seven genes in the 2000 isolates (Sawyer's tests identified a recombinant fragment, which corresponds to this replacement event). Two of these eight genes present in the 1988 isolates (LMOf6854_2352.6 and LMOf6854_2352.7) show no homology to the genes present in the 2000 prophage (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Determination of genome sequences for three <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>isolates obtained from foods and human listeriosis cases linked to a single food processing facility, in conjunction with a previously reported genome sequence for a food isolate linked to the same facility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], provided a unique resource to gain insight into the short-term evolution of <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>in non-controlled environments.

Our data suggest that multiple recombination events lead to diversification of the <italic>comK </italic>prophage, although the occurrence of a single prophage replacement event cannot be excluded. Recombination events seem to have replaced a number of phage genes (including several genes that were annotated as encoding proteins with essential roles in the lytic cycle) with allelic variants or non-homologous genes. For example the gene encoding the major capsid in the 1988 isolates (LMOf6854_2352.7) was replaced with a non-homologous major capsid gene (LMPG_02241.2) in the 2000 isolates. Mechanistically, the observed recombination events in the <italic>comK </italic>prophage most likely occurred through infection with one or more phages in one or more cells of the 1988 genotype, followed by subsequent recombination or phage replacement.

While we did not find any evidence for horizontal gene transfer outside the prophage region in the isolates studied here, horizontal gene transfer in genes in the backbone genome has been well documented in <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. While very little is known about the frequency of phage insertion and phage transduction in bacteria in natural environments, Hodgson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] reported that rates of phage transduction of <italic>Listeria </italic>under laboratory conditions ranged from about 1 to 300 transductants per 10<sup>7 </sup>PFU. In conclusion, while short term evolution of <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>in natural environments involves limited diversification of the genomic backbone, phage-mediated genetic changes appear to be major mechanisms for diversification and evolution of <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>during short evolutionary time frames. This is particularly interesting as there is no evidence for phage-encoded virulence genes in <italic>Listeria</italic>, unlike for a number of other pathogens where phage mediated transfer and diversification of virulence genes appear to represent an important mechanism for diversification.</p><p>Our data are consistent with the overall idea that bacteriophages play multiple important roles in the evolution of bacterial populations in natural environments, including (i) providing selective pressure on bacterial populations (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]) and (ii) providing a mechanism for rapid horizontal exchange of genetic material (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]). Contributions of bacteriophages to genetic diversification also have been well characterized in different pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial species. For example, the <italic>V. cholerae </italic>CTX genetic element represents the genome of a lysogenic bacteriophage, which carries the genes for cholera toxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. This lysogenic phage can be induced in toxigenic strains and the resulting phage particle appears to be able to transduce non-toxigenic <italic>V. cholerae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Similarly, in different <italic>E. coli </italic>pathotypes, shiga-toxin genes as well as genes encoding other virulence factors are located on different prophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Diversification of prophages integrated in the chromosome of bacteria also appears to occur rapidly and commonly and contributes to bacterial genome evolution. For example, in enterohemorrhagic <italic>E. coli </italic>considerable diversification of prophages carrying virulence determinants has been observed, likely indicating independent infections of host bacteria by different bacteriophages carrying these virulence determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Similarly, considerable diversity has been observed in the genome of the <italic>Vibrio </italic>CTX prophage (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]). The importance of bacteriophages and lysogenic prophages in the evolution of gram-positive pathogens has also been documented (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]). For example, the rapid emergence of serotype M3 group A <italic>Streptococcus </italic>(GAS) has been associated with the acquisition of a prophage that contained a unique combination of virulence genes, which was probably generated through several recombination events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Moreover, most of the genetic diversity among GAS strains seems to be phage-related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Prophages and diversification of prophage-associated genes thus appears to play an important role in the evolution of various bacterial species.</p><p>In addition to the diversification in the <italic>comK </italic>prophage, we also found that the four isolates differed in their plasmid content; a plasmid sequence was only found in the 2000 human isolate, as well as in nine additional human isolates linked to this outbreak. While our findings suggest that plasmid loss or acquisition events occurred, it can not be determined whether these changes occurred during <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>survival in the processing plant, during passage of isolates, or during human infection. Rapid diversification of <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>due to plasmid loss or acquisition has previously been reported and isolates from the same outbreak have been shown to differ in their plasmid profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, it is important to note that the media commonly used to isolate <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>(particularly media used for isolation from food samples) contain acriflavine, a plasmid curing agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that the isolates for which no plasmid sequence was obtained lost this plasmid during isolation or during laboratory passage.</p></sec><sec><title>Genome sequence data support that a human listeriosis outbreak in 2000 was caused by a <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>strain that persisted in a food processing plant</title><p>Our data showed that the human and food isolates from a sporadic case in 1988 and the human and food isolates from an outbreak in 2000, which were linked to the same food processing facility, had genome sequences that showed no major inversions, deletions and insertions, although minor changes like these cannot be ruled out since the genome sequences have not been fully finished and assembled. While the four isolates showed a total of 12 confirmed SNPs, all 11 SNPs that occurred in the genome backbone represented singletons, i.e., they were found in only one of the four isolates. The only mutations that differentiated the 1988 isolates from the 2000 isolates were (i) one single SNP in the tRNA-Thr-4-prophage and (ii) a large number of SNPs and deletions in the <italic>comK </italic>prophage, which most likely represent multiple recombination events. This high level of overall genome conservation between the human and food isolates from the 1988 listeriosis case and the 2000 outbreak strongly supports that these two incidences were caused by the same <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>strain, which is likely to have persisted over at least 12 years in the processing plant that produced the food linked to both the 1988 case and the 2000 outbreak. Persistence is also supported by the observation that the PFGE type represented by the persistent strain seems rare (it was only found once among 495 food isolates characterized by PFGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). Re-introduction from the immediate environment surrounding the plant is a possible, but unlikely, alternative to persistence of the specific strain in the processing plant, particularly as ready-to-eat meat processing plants will have controls in place to minimize introduction of microorganisms. Persistence in turkey flocks providing raw materials for this plant is even less likely as the heat treatment used for production of frankfurters and deli meats inactivates <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Similarly, re-introduction through a persistently infected worker is highly unlikely as people rarely shed <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Importantly, even in the unlikely scenario that the unique strain linked to listeriosis cases in 1998 and 2000 was reintroduced, rather than having persisted in the plant, the isolates characterized here would still represent a set of closely related isolates with a parent-descendant relationship, which have multiplied in a non-controlled environment over about 12 years. Thus, the alternative scenarios outlined above do not affect the main conclusions of our study, including that phage mediated mechanisms are critical for short term diversification of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>.</p><p>Overall, our data demonstrate the utility of using full genome sequencing for follow-up investigations to epidemiological and source tracking studies. In particular, full genome sequencing clearly allowed for differentiation of the <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>isolates from the 1988 case and the isolates associated with the 2000 outbreak, even though these isolates were previously found to be identical by other subtyping methods, including PFGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Genome sequencing not only represents the most sensitive subtyping approach conceivable, but also provides for specific identification of differences between isolates, which can be used to assess whether differences between two isolates are likely to have occurred within a short time frame or not. This assessment is critical for source tracking as genomic diversification that can lead to different genomic restriction profiles can clearly occur over short time periods (e.g., through diversification of prophages, loss of plasmids). Rapid diversification in certain hot spots (e.g., prophages) represents a challenge as the current gold standard method for bacterial subtyping is a genomic restriction profiling approach (i.e., PFGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]), which means that closely related isolates may have different PFGE types (as seen in some outbreaks (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]). Importantly though, the standard restriction enzymes used for <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>PFGE analyses (i.e., ApaI and AscI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]) only interrogate &#x0003c;500 nt for SNPs; based on the genome sequence for F6854, there are 39 restriction sites for ApaI, which recognizes a 6 bp motif (yielding 234 bp of DNA interrogated by this enzyme), and 15 restriction sites for AscI, which recognizes a 8 bp motif (yielding 120 bp of DNA interrogated by this enzyme). Thus, genetically distinct isolates may share the same PFGE pattern. For example, Nightingale et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] found that <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>isolates with the same PFGE pattern may differ by presence/absence of premature stop codons in a number of genes, including the virulence gene <italic>inlB</italic>. In contrast to PFGE, our sequence analyses used &#x0003e;2.9 Mb of aligned sequences for subtype discrimination, thus providing for vastly improved detection of substitutions. While we cannot exclude that the isolates characterized show differences in their genomes in addition to those reported here (as the genomes have not been closed and include gaps), this approach clearly provides for a comprehensive sampling of the genomic diversity in the characterized isolates. Future use of full genome sequencing for epidemiological investigations of bacterial infectious disease outbreaks thus seems feasible assuming anticipated continued decreases in the cost of DNA sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] and availability of computational tools that allow for rapid and reliable genome assembly and comparisons.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolate specific SNP patterns in the genomic backbone may occur during environmental growth, isolation or subculture</title><p>Analysis of the single nucleotide polymorphism in the genome backbone of the isolates from both the 1988 listeriosis case and the 2000 listeriosis outbreak also provided us with the ability to probe the evolution of <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>isolates during environmental persistence and during human infection. Based on our data, we hypothesize that the ancestor of F6854 and F6900 (1988 isolates) contaminated the plant in or before 1988. The single SNP differentiating the 1988 human isolate from the 1988 food isolate is consistent with a very close ancestral relationship between these two isolates; the unique SNP in the human isolate could have occurred in the ancestor of the human isolate (F6900) during multiplication in either the plant, the contaminated food, or the infected human or during isolation and propagation of the isolate. The ancestor of F6854 remained in the plant and persisted until 2000. Between 1988 and 2000, the <italic>comK </italic>prophage of that strain was replaced (through one or several recombination events) by the prophage found in the 2000 isolates. Moreover, one mutation that differentiates the 1988 isolates from the 2000 isolates occurred in the tRNA prophage (possibly through a substitution or due to a recombination event). After the <italic>comK </italic>prophage replacement and the tRNA mutation, one mutation in J0161 (the 2000 human isolate) and eight mutations in J2818 (the 2000 food isolate) occurred and differentiated these two isolates from each other and from the 1988 isolates. The substitution that is unique to the 2000 human isolate must have occurred during growth prior to infection and isolation as it was found in the sequenced human isolate (J0161) as well as in an additional 9 human isolates (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). On the other hand, the substitutions in the 2000 food isolate could have occurred during multiplication in the plant, the contaminated food, or during isolation and laboratory propagation. The observation that the 2000 food isolate carries eight unique SNPs, which clearly separated this isolate from the other three isolates, while carrying a <italic>comK </italic>prophage region identical to the 2000 human isolate, suggests that these mutations occurred after the two 2000 isolates diverged from the 1988 strain. The possibility that these SNPs arose during laboratory passages is supported by our observation that two subcultures of the 2000 human isolates differed by one SNP as well as observations that two subcultures of <italic>Bacillus anthracis </italic>strain Porton differed by a number of SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic of the putative evolutionary history of the <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>strain in the food facility between 1988 and 2000</bold>.

The limited number of mutations observed in the genome backbone are consistent with mutation rates in bacteria previously calculated using data from both experimental (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]) and natural populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Rather than single base-pair mutations or rearrangements in the genomic backbone, diversification in prophage sequences, and possibly plasmid loss and acquisition (as also supported by data from others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]), seem to represent the major drivers of diversification in <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>in non-controlled environments. Interestingly, in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, diversification by these mechanisms seems to not target virulence genes as neither plasmid nor phage-based <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>virulence genes have been identified so far. The clearly observed pattern of considerable phage-mediated diversification in highly related <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>isolates with nearly identical genome backbone sequences also demonstrates that the absence of any possibility for phage-mediated diversification during in vitro evolution studies of bacteria represents a major constraint associated with these studies. This report is one of the first studies on the short-term genome evolution of bacteria in a non-controlled environment, thus providing important information that may help in interpretation of data from laboratory evolution experiments. Despite the fact that studies on naturally evolving populations in non-controlled environments will necessarily include a number of drawbacks (e.g., difficulty in identifying parent-descendant pairs with a specific number of separating generations), these studies are a critical complement to laboratory-based studies and are needed to improve our understanding of the evolution of bacteria in natural environments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title><italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>isolates</title><p>The primary isolates characterized here were a human and a food isolate from a 1988 sporadic listeriosis case in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] (isolates F6900 and F6854; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) as well as a human and a food isolate from a 2000 listeriosis outbreak in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] (isolates J0161 and J2818; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

In addition to the chromosome sequences for these four isolates; we also analyzed the plasmid sequence found in the 2000 human isolate (J0161).

TBA runs a series of blastz alignments (i.e., pairwise sequence alignment) between the genome sequences for each isolate. These alignments are subsequently used to build multiple alignment blocks; each block contains the sequences for the isolates included in a pairwise alignment that had been created in the first step. If, for example, J0161 did not have a specific fragment "A" or if the fragment had not been sequenced in this isolate, J0161 did not appear in the block for fragment "A". Because the genome sequence of four of the five isolates is represented in multiple contigs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), several blocks were created; each block could not contain more than one contig from a given isolate. The blocks were filtered to keep only those blocks that contained sequences from all isolates analyzed. The F6854 sequence was used as a reference to order blocks such that the first block started at the start of the F6854 sequence and the last block ended at the end of the F6854 sequence. After completion of the alignment, 62 ambiguous sites in the F6854 genome sequence (e.g., R, S, W, etc.) were manually changed to the consensus sequence of the other isolates at the same position (at all of these sites isolates J0161, J2818, and F6900 had the same nt; thus, these manipulations would not underestimate the number of true differences between the 1988 and 2000 isolates or between the food and human isolates). The alignment blocks were subsequently edited using custom perl scripts (developed by the authors) and BioEdit version 7.0.5.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>] to create one multiple alignment of the sequences in which the blocks were ordered according to the F6854 chromosomal sequence.

A total of 33 pairs of primers were designed since in a few cases multiple polymorphic sites could be amplified in a single fragment. PCR products were purified using Exonuclease I (0.5 U/&#x003bc;l) and Shrimp alkaline phosphatase (0.05 U/&#x003bc;l) (USB, NEB) and sequenced, using standard Sanger fluorescent sequencing methods, at the Core Laboratories Center at Cornell University, USA. Among the PCRs performed for sequencing, five amplified more than one fragment (three amplified two fragments and two amplified three fragments), suggesting that those regions represented repetitive regions in the chromosome. Blastn searches of the target sequences that were used to design these five primer sets against the genomes of F6854 and EGD-e confirmed that the fragments amplified by these primers represented almost identical repetitive sequences and DNA sequencing showed that the polymorphic sites initially identified in these regions were due to misalignments of repetitive sequences. Overall, 11 polymorphisms were confirmed by re-sequencing; importantly, the one SNP in the genome backbone initially identified as differentiating the two 1988 and the two 2000 isolates was not confirmed. Interestingly, one polymorphism in the 2000 food isolate (J0161; SNP #3; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) was not confirmed by re-sequencing, but was confirmed in the trace files available in NCBI, indicating that this polymorphism most likely occurred during laboratory passage of the J0161 subculture sequenced at the Broad Institute (as the sequence at this site in the J0161 subculture at Cornell matched the other 2000 isolate and the two 1988 isolates); we considered this polymorphism as a confirmed polymorphism as it was present in the actual isolate sequenced. In summary, thus, among all 44 polymorphisms identified initially, 12 were confirmed. Among the 32 polymorphism not confirmed, eight represented sequencing errors in F6854 (which was sequenced with the Sanger method) and one represented a sequencing error in J2818; 12 of the polymorphisms that were not confirmed represent problems in the number of bases within homopolymeric tracts and misplacement of the gap in the alignment, and 11 represented misalignments of repetitive regions (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Confirmation of selected indels</title><p>We also chose genome alignment gaps (representing possible indels) that (i) differentiated the two 1988 isolates from the two 2000 isolates (26 gaps) or (ii) differentiated the two human isolates from the two food isolates (34 gaps) for verification.

For a total of six gaps that could not be verified either due to ambiguous sequence data or lack of Sanger sequencing data, verification was performed using re-sequencing; PCR primer design and sequencing were performed as described above. One additional gap was present in a sequence representing a multicopy gene (i.e., a 23S rRNA sequence); no validation of this gap was attempted.</p><p>Verification of the 59 gaps by comparison with pre-existing trace files available in NCBI or by re-sequencing showed that all of these gaps represented alignment artifacts or artifacts due to the sequencing by synthesis technology. Thus, none of the short indels that were initially identified as differentiating the two 1998 from the two 2000 isolates or the two human from the two food isolates could be confirmed and these initially identified indels appear to represent sequencing errors, consistent with previous reports that the sequencing by synthesis strategy often incorrectly characterizes homopolymeric tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of selected polymorphisms and plasmid presence using additional human isolates linked to the 2000 listeriosis outbreak</title><p>In order to identify additional human isolates linked to the 2000 outbreak, the Pathogen Tracker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>] database was used to identify human isolates that shared the same ribotype as the outbreak strain (DUP-1053A) and were isolated during the time frame of the outbreak (May to November of 2000) in some of the states (New York, Michigan and Ohio) that were included in the outbreak. Selected isolates identified through this approach were tested for rhamnose fermentation as well as by PFGE to identify specific isolates that matched the outbreak strain. Rhamnose fermentation was tested as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>] with the exception that only one tube without a mineral oil overlay was used. PFGE with the restriction enzymes ApaI and AscI was performed using the US CDC standard PulseNet protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Nine isolates matching the rhamnose fermentation characteristics and PFGE profile of the 1988 and 2000 isolates were selected to validate the polymorphisms described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> using PCR amplification and subsequent sequencing (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> for primers) of the regions containing these polymorphisms. All 9 of these isolates were also screened for the presence of two plasmid-specific sequences using PCR (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> for primers).</p><p>Unfortunately neither additional food nor additional human isolates linked to the 1988 case were available for analyses. Furthermore, no additional food or plant environmental isolates from 2000 or the period between 1998 and 2000 were available for analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Intracellular growth assay in activated J774 macrophage-like cells</title><p><italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>strains were grown in BHI at 37&#x000b0;C with shaking at 220 RPM. Log phase (OD<sub>600 </sub>= 0.4) <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>strains in BHI were diluted 1:100 and grown at 37&#x000b0;C to early stationary phase (defined as 3 h after the OD<sub>600 </sub>reached 1.0). Aliquots of the stationary phase cultures were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and cultures were enumerated after thawing. The murine macrophage cell line J774A.1 (ATCC TIB-67) was maintained using Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) with Earle's salts and 1% sodium pyruvate (Gibco; Gaithersburg, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate (Gibco), and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml each penicillin G and streptomycin (J774 medium).</p><p>Intracellular growth assays were performed as described by Conte <italic>et al</italic>., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">82</xref>] with minor modifications. Briefly, 48 h prior to the assay, J774 cells were seeded into 24 well plates (Corning) at a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well in J774 medium without antibiotics. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the medium was replaced with J774 medium supplemented with 0.1 &#x003bc;g/ml <italic>E. coli </italic>O55:B5 LPS (Sigma). Thirty minutes prior to infection, the medium was replaced with fresh J774 medium without antibiotics. For infection, approximately 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>CFU <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>were added to each well, resulting in an MOI of approximately 1. At 30 minutes post infection, the monolayers were washed once with PBS to remove any unassociated <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, and the medium was replaced with J774 media containing 50 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamycin to kill any extracellular <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. Infected J774 cells in different wells were washed 3 times with PBS and lysed with ice-cold distilled water after at 1, 5, 7, or 9 h post infection. Intracellular <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>were enumerated by plating the appropriate dilutions of the J774 lysate on BHI.</p><p>Intracellular growth assays were initially performed separately with the two isolates to be tested (i.e., J0161 and J2818), but were also performed in a competition experiment format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], where activated J774 cells were infected with both <italic>L. monocytogenes </italic>isolates (mixed at a 1:1 ratio). To assess the frequency of each strain after intracellular growth in the competition experiment, ten colonies recovered after 9 h of intracellular growth were selected from each of the three replicates for PCR amplification and sequencing of the region containing SNP 10 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) using primers RHO105-2327842F and RHO106-2327842R (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RHO perceived the study, performed genome alignments and genome alignment analyses, and re-sequencing of selected polymorphic sites; he drafted the manuscript.
