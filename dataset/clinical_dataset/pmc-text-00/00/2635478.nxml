Among these, phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITP) are of particular interest as they can bind to and transfer phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) &#x02013; the precursor of important signalling molecules, phosphoinositides &#x02013; and because they have essential functions in neuronal development (PITP&#x003b1;) and cytokinesis (PITP&#x003b2;). Structural analysis indicates that, in the cytosol, PITPs are in a &#x02018;closed&#x02019; conformation completely shielding the lipid within them. But during lipid exchange at the membrane, they must transiently &#x02018;open&#x02019;. To study PITP dynamics in intact cells, we chemically targeted their C95 residue that, although non-essential for lipid transfer, is buried within the phospholipid-binding cavity, and so, its chemical modification prevents PtdIns binding because of steric hindrance. This treatment resulted in entrapment of open conformation PITPs at the membrane and inactivation of the cytosolic pool of PITPs within few minutes. PITP isoforms were differentially inactivated with the dynamics of PITP&#x003b2; faster than PITP&#x003b1;. We identify two tryptophan residues essential for membrane docking of PITPs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lipid-binding cavity</kwd><kwd>lipid exchange</kwd><kwd>PITP domain</kwd><kwd>PtdCho transport</kwd><kwd>PtdIns transport</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITP&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;) are highly conserved 32-kDa soluble proteins that can bind and transfer phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) between cellular membranes <italic>in vitro</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). They are ideal candidates for the intracellular distribution of PtdIns from its site of synthesis, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to other membrane compartments. Mice deficient in PITP&#x003b1; die shortly after birth because of neurological defects, while PITP&#x003b2; deficiency is embryonically lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). PITP&#x003b1; is required for phospholipase-C- and phosphoinositide-3-kinase-mediated signalling during axonal outgrowth, whereas PITP&#x003b2; participates in delivery of membrane vesicles and maintaining the actin ring at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>The two human PITPs are 77% identical and 94% similar in amino acid sequence. Structurally, soluble PITP&#x003b1; and PITP&#x003b2; are also very similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). An eight-stranded concave &#x003b2;-sheet flanked by two long &#x003b1; helices forms a hydrophobic cavity that protects a single phospholipid from the hydrophilic environment of the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>). An &#x003b1; helix (G-helix), together with 11 C-terminal amino acid residues, functions as a &#x02018;lid&#x02019; to close the cavity. In the crystal structure of apo-PITP&#x003b1;, structural changes including repositioning of the G-helix, C-terminal tail and the &#x02018;lipid-binding loop&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1B</xref>) suggest that the apo form may resemble the membrane-associated form. These changes would expose the hydrophobic lipid-binding side chains of apo-PITP&#x003b1; monomer, but interactions with a second PITP&#x003b1; molecule serve to bury these residues in the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Also, PITP&#x003b1; dimerizes when its 24 C-terminus amino acids are proteolytically removed with subtilisin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), a treatment that would expose at least some of its hydrophobic side chains. This PITP&#x003b1; dimer cannot participate in lipid transfer.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The C95 residue in PITP&#x003b1; is located close to the lipid-headgroup-binding site</title><p>The position of C95 residue is shown in A) the closed (lipid-bound) and in B) the open (lipid-free) conformations of a PITP&#x003b1; molecule. The lipid-binding core residues are coloured blue, the G-helix and the extended 11 amino acids at the C-terminus that form the lid are coloured red, the regulatory loop is coloured green and the lipid exchange loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) is coloured grey. C95 is depicted as balls and is coloured yellow; it is inaccessible to small molecules in the closed conformation (A) but exposed in the apo structure (B). The backbone of the surface residue C188 is coloured yellow. In the apo structure, the lipid exchange loop and the G-helix have moved to the open configuration and the C-terminal region is disordered. The side chains of W203 and 204 are coloured orange. The diagrams were generated using the <sc>pymol</sc>software with PDB files 1t27 and 1kcm. C) A stick model showing a PtdIns molecule (magenta carbon atoms) and the functionally important inositol-binding residues K61, N90, T59 and E86 in the lipid-binding cavity of PITP&#x003b1;. Also, labelled are the four residues that make contact with the phosphate moiety of the phospholipids, Q22, T97, T114 and K195. C95 (green carbon atoms and yellow sulphur atom) is seen to be in close proximity to the inositol ring (PDB code: 1UW5). D) Docking of NEM on C95 illustrates that alkylation of C95 would sterically hinder phospholipid binding. The NEM is shown with yellow carbon atoms and clashes with PtdIns (shown with a pink surface). E) Model for membrane interactions and lipid exchange by PITPs. 1) Soluble PITP bound to PtdIns in the closed conformation in the cytosol. 2) PITP initially docks onto a membrane using the two tryptophan residues (WW). 3) Conformational change of PITP at the membrane into an open form involves movement of the C-terminus and G &#x003b1;-helix, which exposes the hydrophobic surface of the lipid-binding cavity. This allows lipid exchange of PtdIns for PtdCho to occur. 4) Following lipid exchange, PITP bound to PtdCho undergoes a conformational change into the closed form. 5) PITP bound to PtdCho in the closed conformation is soluble and freely diffuses away from the membrane.

The five available hydroxyl groups of the inositol ring individually make contact with four amino acid residues of PITP&#x003b1;, T59, K61, E86 and N90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1C</xref>) (We follow previous convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) and use the numbering of rat PITP&#x003b1; throughout the paper. Human PITP&#x003b1; has an almost identical sequence to rat PITP&#x003b1; with only a single residue deletion at position 52. This allows for easy comparison between this work and the previous publications), and mutation of any of these residues compromises PtdIns binding and transfer without affecting PtdCho binding and transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Although close to the inositol-headgroup-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1C</xref>), C95 is not essential for lipid transfer as C95A mutation has no effect on lipid transfer ability of PITP&#x003b1;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). However, chemical modification of C95 of recombinant PITP&#x003b1;<italic>in vitro</italic>with thiol-modifying reagents results in loss of PtdIns transfer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), probably because the bound adduct occupies the space required by the lipid headgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1D</xref>). C95 is buried when PITP&#x003b1; is in the &#x02018;closed&#x02019; soluble conformation but becomes exposed and prone to modification when PITP&#x003b1; is allowed to transiently associate with liposomes during lipid exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>Although PITPs can bind and transfer lipids between membrane compartments <italic>in vitro</italic>, whether they function as lipid transfer proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>has not been established. Analysis of cellular PITPs only identified the lipid-loaded forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), indicating the transient nature of the apo form. Thus, it is also unknown how frequently PITPs dock on membranes and undergo a cycle of &#x02018;open&#x02019; and closed conformations, an indicator of lipid exchange <italic>in vivo</italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1E</xref>). In the case of PITP&#x003b2;, a population is localized to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), but its conformational state is not known. Because thiol-modifying agents can only access C95 when PITP&#x003b1; is in the open conformation on liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), we used them &#x02013; n-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and 2,2&#x02032;-dithiodipyridine (DTDP) &#x02013; as tools to measure the dynamics of PITP interaction with membranes in intact cells. Using the software tool <sc>mapas</sc>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) to predict membrane-contacting protein surfaces, optimal docking area prediction on both PITP&#x003b1; and PITP&#x003b2; identifies the dimer interface, with strong values for W203/W204 residues. We have tested this prediction <italic>in vivo</italic>and find that PITP&#x003b1; and PITP&#x003b2; are unable to undergo a change to an open conformation at the membrane when the two tryptophan residues are mutated to alanine.</p><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PITP dynamics in live cells revealed using the sulphydryl-modifying reagent, NEM</title><p>Because NEM inactivation requires conformational changes of the protein upon binding a membrane and modification would prevent lipid exchange, inactivation of the transfer activity of cytosolic PITP provides an indication of PITP undergoing conformational change from closed to open. Intact HL60 cells were treated with NEM for 10 min and were then disrupted by sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged to separate membranes and cytosol. The cytosolic fraction of control cells has robust PtdIns transfer activity, which was inhibited in the cytosol prepared from NEM-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2A</xref>). The distribution of PITP&#x003b2; between the membranes and the cytosol following NEM treatment of intact HL60 cells was also examined (HL60 cells predominantly express PITP&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). In control HL60 cells, PITP&#x003b2; was mainly found in the cytosolic fraction. A very small amount of PITP&#x003b2; that was occasionally found associated with the membranes probably corresponds to the Golgi-associated population of this isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figures 2B and 3A</xref>). Following NEM treatment, a significant redistribution of PITP&#x003b2; to the membrane fractions was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B</xref>); PITP&#x003b2; levels increased from 0.2 to 4.1 ng in the membranes (30 &#x003bc;g). This increase was accompanied by a slight decrease in the PITP&#x003b2; content in the cytosolic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B</xref>). Based on densitometric analysis, we estimate that, upon NEM treatment, &#x0223c;10&#x02013;15% of PITP&#x003b2; became membrane associated taking into consideration the total amount of cytosolic and membrane proteins present. Therefore, retention of PITP&#x003b2; to membranes alone cannot account for the inhibition of lipid transfer observed in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Inhibition of PtdIns transfer activity and membrane retention of PITP&#x003b2; following NEM treatment of HL60 cells</title><p>HL60 cells were treated with 1 m<sc>m</sc>NEM for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C, and cytosol and membranes were subsequently prepared. A) PtdIns transfer activity in cytosol prepared from control (closed circles) and NEM-treated cells (open circles). B) Thirty micrograms of HL60 membranes and cytosol were analysed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, followed by western blot analysis from control and NEM-treated cells. Recombinant PITP&#x003b2; was run in parallel to quantify the amount of PITP&#x003b2;. The values are indicated above the blot in nanograms. C and D) HL60 cytosol (180 &#x003bc;L) from control and NEM-treated cells was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (Superose 12 column 10/300), and the fractions were assayed for PtdIns and PtdCho transfer activity (inset) (C) and PITP&#x003b2; distribution by western blot analysis (D). The column was calibrated using a kit containing proteins of molecular weight 200, 67, 43, 25, and 13.7 kDa, and their elution profile is indicated in (D). PITP&#x003b2; in the cytosol prepared from NEM-treated cells elutes as a 67-kDa protein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="tra0009-1743-f2"/></fig><p>Membrane association of PITP&#x003b2; and inhibition of PtdIns transfer activity were dependent on both the concentration of NEM used to treat the HL60 cells and the time of incubation with NEM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2</xref>). Maximal retention to the membrane fractions was observed after treatment with 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>NEM for 10 min, a concentration that led to significant inhibition (&#x0223c;40%) of lipid transfer. Nearly 75% of the transfer activity was lost with 250 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>NEM, and near maximal inactivation was observed with 500 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>NEM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2A,B</xref>). Treatment with 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>NEM for 2 min also caused significant membrane retention of PITP&#x003b2;, and maximal retention was observed following treatment with 500 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>NEM for 2 min. Significant inhibition of lipid transfer (&#x0223c;60%) was observed with 500 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>NEM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Figure S2C,D</xref>). In all, the association of PITP&#x003b2; to membranes was rapid and was observed at much lower concentration of NEM than that required for inhibition of transfer activity.</p><p>We next examined whether PtdIns transfer activity observed in the cytosolic fraction was primarily because of PITPs. Cytosol from HL60 cells was separated by size exclusion chromatography, and the fractions were examined for both PtdIns and PtdCho transfer activity as well as by western blot using antibodies for PITP&#x003b2;. A single peak of PtdIns (and PtdCho) transfer activity present in fractions 20&#x02013;23 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2C</xref>, see inset). Western blot analysis of the same fractions revealed that PITP&#x003b2; (and PITP&#x003b1;, data not shown) eluted in these fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2D</xref>, top panel), establishing that the PtdIns transfer activity in HL60 cytosol is mainly because of the activity of PITP&#x003b2; with a small contribution from PITP&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Cytosol was also prepared from NEM-treated HL60 cells and similarly fractionated by size exclusion chromatography. Minimal PtdIns or PtdCho transfer activity was observed in the fractionated cytosol from NEM-treated HL60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2C</xref>). Western blot analysis of the same fractions revealed that NEM-modified PITP&#x003b2; eluted as a protein with a larger than expected Stokes radius although on SDS&#x02013;PAGE it still migrated as a 32-kDa protein, similar to PITP&#x003b2; from control cells. Using molecular weight markers to calibrate the size exclusion chromatography column, we calculate that PITP&#x003b2; elutes as a 67-kDa protein &#x02013; that is, roughly twice its normal size. This can be rationalized by assuming that NEM-modified PITP&#x003b2; exists in the hydrophilic environment of the cytosol as a dimer so that the hydrophobic residues that would otherwise be exposed in an apo-PITP-like structure are buried in the dimer interface.</p></sec><sec><title>Visualization of PITP&#x003b2; entrapment to the Golgi and the ER revealed using NEM</title><p>PITP&#x003b2; has been reported to localize at the Golgi when examined by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). However, this observation does not identify whether PITP&#x003b2; is constantly undergoing changes from closed to open conformation. We therefore used the rat kidney cell line normal rat kidney (NRK), which expresses significant levels of PITP&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>), and examined localization of endogenous PITP&#x003b2; upon treatment with 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>NEM in cells fixed prior to permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3A,B</xref>) and fixed after permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3C,D</xref>). PITP&#x003b2; is localized at the Golgi but additionally shows a diffuse localization within the cytoplasm and faintly at the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3A</xref>). This staining could correspond to PITP&#x003b2; either associated with the ER or is cytosolic. When the cells are permeabilized prior to fixation, association of PITP&#x003b2; with the Golgi observed by immunofluorescence is markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3C</xref>). These results parallel the results when cells are homogenized and membrane fractions examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2B</xref>). To examine whether PITP&#x003b2; is on the ER membrane, we used low concentrations of NEM (100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) to capture PITP&#x003b2;, followed by examination by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3B,D</xref>). This NEM treatment does not affect the structure of the Golgi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3</xref>). In NEM-treated cells, PITP&#x003b2; is now retained despite permeabilization of the cells prior to fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition to the Golgi-localized PITP&#x003b2;, the diffuse staining is still observed, indicating that PITP&#x003b2; associates with the ER compartment as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3D</xref>). Staining of the nuclear envelope is also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3D</xref>). When the cells were not permeabilized prior to fixation, NEM treatment enhanced the staining of the Golgi compared with non-treated cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). In addition, the staining of the nuclear envelope is clearly observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>NEM treatment retains PITP&#x003b2; at the Golgi and ER compartment in NRK cells</title><p>NRK cells were treated with 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>NEM for 5 min, quenched with &#x003b2;-ME (20 m<sc>m</sc>) and either fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before permeabilization with digitonin (40 &#x003bc;g/mL) (top panels) or permeabilized with digitonin on ice before fixation (bottom panels).

Exposure of either membranes or PITPs to NEM prior to their use in the transfer assay did not inhibit lipid transfer, suggesting that NEM can only target the C95 residue in the presence of membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S5A,B</xref>). These results are in agreement with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Hence, NEM inhibits transfer activity of both PITP&#x003b1; and PITP&#x003b2;, and C95 is the only residue involved in inhibition of PtdIns transfer. Furthermore, NEM can only access C95 when PITP&#x003b1; or PITP&#x003b2; interact with membranes.</p></sec><sec><title>Resistance to inhibition by NEM of the C95 mutants in COS-7 cells</title><p>We next examined whether the C95 mutants were resistant to inhibition by NEM in intact cells as the transfer activity of C95 PITP mutants is resistant to inhibition by NEM <italic>in vitro</italic>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Figure S4B,D</xref>).

PC12 cells were treated with 1 m<sc>m</sc>NEM for 2, 5 and 10 min, and the cytosols were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography. Transfer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6A</xref>), immunoreactivity of both PITPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6B</xref>) and protein content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6C</xref>) were monitored in the individual fractions. (The amount of protein recovery is slightly less in cells treated with NEM for 10 min, and this underestimates the residual transfer activity in this sample.) In untreated cells, PtdIns transfer activity was coincident with the fractions containing both PITP&#x003b1; and PITP&#x003b2; (fractions 20&#x02013;24) (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). In cytosol prepared from NEM-treated PC12 cells, PtdIns transfer activity was diminished with time of incubation but not totally obliterated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6A</xref>). Analysis of the same fractions by western blot revealed that although in NEM-treated cells, both PITP&#x003b1; and PITP&#x003b2; now elute in earlier fractions on gel filtration (an indication of inactivation), the rate of inactivation was different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6B</xref>). Within 2 min of treatment with NEM, the majority of PITP&#x003b2; now elutes in fractions 16&#x02013;18. By contrast, a substantial amount of PITP&#x003b1; remains in fractions 20&#x02013;23 at 2 min. Although there was a progressive reduction with time of PITP&#x003b1; in fractions 20&#x02013;23 with a corresponding increase in immunoreactivity in the earlier fractions, even at 10 min, some PITP&#x003b1; still remained in fractions 20&#x02013;23. This suggests that a population of PITP&#x003b1; remained unaffected by NEM treatment in the time frame of these experiments.

Although structural analysis had implied that PITPs are exquisitely designed to bind and transfer lipids, and they certainly do so <italic>in vitro,</italic>it has not been previously possible to demonstrate that PITPs undergo lipid exchange in intact cells and if so, with what frequency. Only one previous study investigated the behaviour of PITP in cells using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to examine fluorescence resonance energy transfer between green fluorescent protein-tagged PITP and BODIPY&#x000ae;-labelled PtdIns or PtdCho in COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). There, it was found that interaction between PITP and PtdIns or PtdCho increases upon stimulation with EGF, and this occurred at 20 min after EGF treatment. In this experimental system, however, the basal dynamics could not be measured as the experiments were conducted in chemically fixed cells.</p><p>In this study, we used thiol-modifying chemicals (NEM and DTDP) to modify a strategically located cysteine residue as a tool to monitor interactions of PITP with membranes in the context of intact cells. Both PITP&#x003b1; and PITP&#x003b2; contain four conserved cysteine residues at positions 95, 188, 192 and 231 in these proteins&#x02019; amino acid sequence. Previous <italic>in vitro</italic>studies showed that in PITP&#x003b1;, these four residues exhibit differential reactivities to thiol-modifying reagents such as NEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). For instance, C192 and C231 do not react with NEM, consistent with their side chains being buried in both the open and the closed lipid-bound structures. C188 is surface exposed and can be modified with NEM, but it is not functionally important. C95 is unique in that it is only reactive to NEM when PITP is associated with membranes, adopting an open conformation to release its lipid cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). We show that the <italic>in vitro</italic>transfer activity of both PITP&#x003b1; and PITP&#x003b2; is only inhibited when NEM is present during intermembrane transfer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5">Figure S5</xref>). The inhibition results from NEM modification of cysteine residue 95, which resides in the lipid-headgroup-binding cavity of PITP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A&#x02013;D</xref>); mutation of C95 to either alanine or threonine makes both PITP&#x003b1; and PITP&#x003b2; resistant to inhibition by NEM and by DTDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figures 4 and 7</xref>).</p><p>Within 2 min of treating HL60 or PC12 cells with NEM, association of PITP with membranes is detected, indicating that, in intact cells, PITP molecules are constantly sampling membranes. It must be noted that, despite the increase in membrane association of PITPs upon NEM treatment, a significant proportion of these proteins are present in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figures 2B and 6B</xref>). This suggests one of two possibilities: the concentration of NEM used in this study is insufficient to result in the retention of the total cytosolic PITP pool to the membranes and hence their modification, or the PITP pool that has been covalently modified by NEM at the membranes is able to dissociate even without a bound phospholipid. The latter seems to be the case because the cytosolic pool of PITP from NEM-treated cells is inactivated for PtdIns transfer. Based on their loss of ability to transfer PtdIns and PtdCho, it appears that, within minutes of treatment with NEM, almost all the PITP molecules present in HL60, PC12 and COS-7 cells have been in contact with the membranes and thus had their C95 residues exposed to NEM. Our size exclusion chromatography data indicate that NEM-modified cytosolic PITPs elute as dimers. This would suggest that NEM binding has caused the PITP protein to adopt an open conformation, similar to that found in apo-PITP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>); we note that C95 in the apo-protein structure was reported as being chemically modified, as evidenced by an electron density peak 1.8 &#x000c5; from the SG atom [modelled as a water molecule in the protein database (PDB) entry] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Apo-PITP&#x003b1; forms crystallographic dimers to bury the hydrophobic residues within the lipid-binding cavity in the dimer interface, and the two lipid exchange loops make contact with the partner lipid-binding regions. It has been suggested that binding of a phospholipid is required for PITPs to fully arrive at the closed soluble conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). So, NEM-modified PITP likely adopts a dimeric arrangement analogous to that found in the apo-PITP&#x003b1; structure.</p><p>The open conformation NEM-modified PITPs are likely to dissociate from the membrane during lipid transfer more slowly than WT PITPs. Consequently, when membranes of NEM-treated cells are examined, some PITPs are detected that are still membrane associated. This is not seen in membranes prepared from control cells. When NEM-modified PITP eventually leaves the membranes, it forms dimers that shield its hydrophobic residues but are not capable of PtdIns transfer. Using NEM in intact cells, our data clearly demonstrate that the majority of PITPs have interacted with the membrane within 10 min. This emphasizes the dynamic nature of PITP interaction with membranes in intact cells.</p><p>When examined by immunofluorescence microscopy that both endogenous and overexpressed PITP&#x003b2; localize at the Golgi compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) as well as diffusely in the cytosol. The diffuse staining is because of PITP&#x003b2; associating with membranous structures, most likely ER, as demonstrated by its retention in the cell following NEM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>). As all the cellular PITP&#x003b2; is inactivated upon NEM treatment, our data indicate that the Golgi pool of this protein is in rapid dynamic equilibrium with the ER pool. In addition, the membrane-associated PITP&#x003b2; is undergoing a rapid change in conformation from open to closed.</p><p>In PC12 cells, a small fraction of PITP&#x003b1; appears to be somewhat resistant to inactivation by NEM in the 10-min time frame studied. There could be two explanations that are not mutually exclusive. The resistant subpopulation could represent the nuclear pool of PITP&#x003b1; that is not in close proximity to membranes and might not go through a cycle of open and closed conformation during the 10-min period studied in this study. Alternatively, it could represent a population of PITP&#x003b1; phosphorylated at Ser166, which causes inactivation of its PtdIns transfer activity by an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).</p><p>The first step in the process of lipid exchange is for PITP to dock on to membrane surfaces. We identify two tryptophan residues that are critical for this process in intact cells. We had previously shown that mutation of the two tryptophans to alanine in PITP&#x003b1; led to loss of PtdIns transfer activity <italic>in vitro</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Using NEM as a tool for trapping the open form of PITP to membranes, a measure for docking can be monitored by assessing the retention of PITP to membranes. Mutation of these two tryptophan residues W203/W204 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1A</xref>) to alanine prevents membrane association of both PITP&#x003b1; and PITP&#x003b2;. This is coupled to the loss of lipid transfer in these mutants indicating that, without docking to membranes, PITPs cannot transfer lipids.</p><p>We found that the WW203/204AA mutant of PITP&#x003b2; is no longer enriched in the Golgi compartment and instead is localized in the nucleus. Although the reason behind the redistribution of this mutant within the cell is not clear, a possible explanation is that when WW203/204AA mutant of PITP&#x003b2; is no longer retained at the Golgi, it is free to move to the nucleus. This is not surprising as PITP&#x003b1;, which is similar to PITP&#x003b2; in both structure and size, also partitions into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). In the case of PITP&#x003b2;-WT, because it preferentially localizes to the Golgi, the free population of it might be limited for it to also localize in the nucleus.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates a continuous sampling of the cellular membranes by PITP&#x003b1; and PITP&#x003b2; making use of two tryptophan residues to initiate the &#x02018;opening&#x02019; of the hydrophobic cavity. The two tryptophan residues are located at the end of the helix F adjacent to helix G that has to dislodge to open the cavity. Thus, by inserting the two tryptophan residues into the membrane, this would perturb the helix G. Tryptophan residues are known to have a preference for membrane surfaces because of the aromatic ring and its molecular shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Our data support a model whereby PITPs undergo a cycle of closed and open conformation and are thus likely to function as lipid transfer proteins in intact cells. In the case of PITP&#x003b2;, our results indicate that lipid transfer takes place between the ER and the Golgi.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all the tissue culture products used were from Invitrogen or Sigma.

To examine the effect of NEM on recombinant proteins, PITPs were pretreated with NEM (0&#x02013;5 m<sc>m</sc>) in the presence of liposomes and NEM was quenched with 20-fold excess of &#x003b2;-ME (20&#x02013;100 m<sc>m</sc>) and then assayed for transfer activity. Percentage transfer was calculated from the total counts present in microsomes after subtracting the number of counts transferred in the absence of a PITP source. PtdCho transfer activity was monitored using permeabilized HL60 cells prelabelled with [<sup>3</sup>H]choline to label the choline lipids, predominantly PtdCho, exactly as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). Transfer activity was monitored in duplicate samples, and the error bars denote the range of the averages.

Approximately 1&#x02013;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> cells were used per treatment. COS-7 cells were used either as adherent cells or trypsinized and used in suspension. The results were identical regardless of the protocol.

NEM or DTDP treatment was terminated by the addition of 20 m<sc>m</sc>&#x003b2;-ME or by centrifugation and washing with 10 mL of ice-cold PBS at 4&#x000b0;C. The cells were resuspended in 300 &#x003bc;L PBS in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). To prepare membranes and cytosol, the cells were sonicated on ice (50 microns, 3 &#x000d7; 15 seconds) and centrifuged for 10 min (2000 &#x000d7; <bold><italic>g</italic></bold>, 4&#x000b0;C) to pellet the nuclei and unbroken cells. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 110 000 &#x000d7; <bold><italic>g</italic></bold>at 4&#x000b0;C to pellet the membranes, and the supernatant consisting of the cytosolic fraction was retained for further analysis. To remove contaminating cytosolic proteins, the membranes were resuspended in 1 mL of SET buffer (0.25 <sc>m</sc>sucrose, 1 m<sc>m</sc>ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 10 m<sc>m</sc>Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 110 000 &#x000d7; <bold><italic>g</italic></bold>(4&#x000b0;C, 30 min). The membranes were resuspended in 100 &#x003bc;L of SET buffer or in PBS. Protein concentrations were determined for both the membrane and the cytosolic fractions. The distribution of PITPs (&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;) between membranes and the cytosol was analysed through separation of the proteins on a 12% sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel followed by western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Fractionation of cytosol by size exclusion chromatography and analysis of lipid transfer</title><p>For analysis of the cytosol by size exclusion chromatography, the cells were disrupted using repeated freeze&#x02013;thaw cycles. This protocol was chosen so that the cytosol could be obtained in a small volume (150 &#x003bc;L). Two hundred millilitres of confluent HL60 or PC12 cells was used per condition, and the cell pellet was transferred into an Eppendorf tube and resuspended in 100 &#x003bc;L of PBS-containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The cells were frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C overnight. The following day, they were transferred to a salted ice bath for 6 h in a chilled cabinet, and then, they were transferred to &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C overnight. This process was repeated on the second day. On the third day, the samples were rapidly thawed on ice and immediately centrifuged on a bench top Optima&#x02122; ultracentrifuge (Beckman) (110 000 &#x000d7; <bold><italic>g</italic></bold>, 30 min, 4&#x000b0;C). The cytosol was carefully decanted and recentrifuged at 15 000 &#x000d7; <bold><italic>g</italic></bold>for 10 min, and 150&#x02013;180 &#x003bc;L (2&#x02013;3 mg of total protein) was immediately loaded on a Superose 12 column 10/300; bed volume 24 mL (GE Healthcare) and eluted with PBS). 0.5 mL fractions were collected. (The first 3 mL was not collected; the conversion of elution volume to fraction number can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6C</xref> where both scales are shown.) Hundred-microlitre aliquots of the individual fractions were analysed for PtdIns or PtdCho transfer immediately, and 50-&#x003bc;L aliquots of the individual fractions were combined with sample buffer for western blot analysis. For PtdIns transfer, 150 &#x003bc;L of a mixture of microsomes and liposomes was added to each of the fractions and processed exactly as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). For PtdCho transfer, 100 &#x003bc;L of the fraction was analysed using the cytosol-depleted permeabilized HL60 cells as the donor compartment exactly as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment of NRK and COS-7 cells with NEM followed by immunofluorescence</title><p>NRK cells were plated onto glass cover slips and washed twice with HEPES buffer (20 m<sc>m</sc>HEPES, 137 m<sc>m</sc>NaCl, 3 m<sc>m</sc>KCl, 1 m<sc>m</sc>CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 m<sc>m</sc>MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mg/mL glucose and 1 mg/ml BSA) and treated with 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>NEM in HEPES buffer for 5 min at 37<sup>o</sup>C.
