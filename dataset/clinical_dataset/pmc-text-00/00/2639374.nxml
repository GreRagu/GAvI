Unlike other blood cells, MCs migrate into peripheral tissues as immature progenitors and differentiate into mature mast cells. One of the unique features of MCs is that they show a variety of phenotypes depending on the different tissue microenvironment of their maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In MCs, various MC-specific serine proteases are stored in the secretory granules, and their gene and protein expressions are dramatically altered when their cell environment is altered. For example, Reynolds <italic>et al. </italic>have shown that at least six distinct members of mouse MC-specific serine proteases are expressed in different combinations in different mast cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, recent studies have shown that mature MCs vary in terms of what surface receptors and lipid mediators they express [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Because each mast cell population <italic>in vivo </italic>must play a specific role in the body, it is important to determine the character of each population of MCs.</p><p>Comprehensive gene expression analysis is a powerful approach to understand the characterization of various MC subpopulations. To date, several studies on microarray analysis of MCs have been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], but most of them dealt with MCs cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>. Alternatively, gene expression profiles of MCs isolated from skin and lung have been analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, the numbers of MCs analyzed as one sample were relatively high and they were exposed to physical forces, enzymes and the anti-Kit antibody for purification, during which the original properties of the MCs may have been affected.</p><p>In the gastrointestinal tract, there are MCs that are mainly classified into two subclasses; mucosal MCs (mMCs) and submucosal MCs (sMCs) on the basis of their location, morphology (size and shape) and granule contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. mMCs are mainly found in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal system, having chondroitin sulfate-containing granules, which are stained with toluidine blue but not safranin, and their activation occurs during parasite infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], while sMCs are localized in the submucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and their granules are rich in heparin and stained with both toluidine blue and safranin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, the molecular basis determining the differences in biochemical properties of these two MC subclasses remains uncertain, partially due to the difficulty of their isolation.</p><p>To overcome these problems, here we established a method of RNA amplification from intact MCs isolated from frozen tissue sections, which enables us to conveniently obtain the global gene expression pattern of MCs in various tissues. To validate this method, we first determined the minimum cell number required to achieve reproducible RNA amplification. We then compared the gene expression profiles obtained from small numbers of mMCs and sMCs in the mouse stomach, and found several key genes to be specifically expressed in one subclass of MCs, which may reflect some aspects of the distinct properties between the two MC subclasses in the gastrointestinal tract.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Development of an RNA amplification protocol to obtain gene expression profiles from a small amount of RNA</title><p>To gain insight into the functional differences between the different subclasses of MCs, we employed three rounds of the T7-based RNA amplification method. Based on the preliminary experiments using peritoneal MCs and bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs), we estimated that a single MC yields 2 pg of RNA. Before we performed comparative analysis of MCs from different tissues, we first evaluated the accuracy and reproducibility of three rounds of the T7-based RNA amplification method, starting with the amount of RNA that can be obtained from a single MC. To assess this, we first compared the microarray results obtained from 5 &#x003bc;g of BMMC RNA prepared by the standard protocol with those obtained from the same RNA diluted 10<sup>5</sup>- or 10<sup>6</sup>-fold (30 pg, 10 pg and 2 pg) and subjected to three rounds of T7-based amplification (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a&#x02013;c</xref>). Although three rounds of amplification yielded enough quantity of RNA for microarray analysis (&#x0003e;20 &#x003bc;g) even in the case of 2 pg RNA, scatter plot analysis revealed that the qualities of the obtained results were quite different between the samples from 5 &#x003bc;g and 2 pg RNA. The genes judged as 'Presence' in both 30 pg and 5 &#x003bc;g of RNA were 8,149 genes, which corresponded to 72% of genes judged as 'Presence' in the 5 &#x003bc;g of RNA (11,344 genes; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), while only 4,116 genes were judged as 'Presence' in both 2 pg and 5 &#x003bc;g of RNA, which corresponded to only 36% of genes judged as 'Presence' in the 5 &#x003bc;g RNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). The decrease in the number of genes judged as 'Presence' in the diluted samples (30 pg, 10 pg and 2 pg) may be due to the loss of low copy number RNA species during amplification.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparisons of three round-amplified products starting with very small quantities of RNA</bold>.

In the 30 pg RNA samples, 7,537 (30 pg-1) and 8,777 (30 pg-2) genes were judged as 'Presence'. However, only 4,324 (2 pg-1) and 4,460 (2 pg-2) genes were judged as 'Presence' in each 2 pg RNA sample, again suggesting the loss of low copy number RNAs during amplification from a small amount of RNA. As to the reproducibility, 86% of the 'Presence' genes in the 30 pg-1 and 74% of 'Presence' genes in the 30 pg-2 sample were judged as 'Presence' in both 30 pg RNA samples, while only 57% of 'Presence' genes in the 2 pg-1 and 55% of 'Presence' genes in the 2 pg-2 sample were judged as 'Presence' in both 2 pg RNA samples. These results suggested that the amplified products from the RNA from a single MC (about 2 pg) by the current method may include considerable amplification artifacts causing problems in accuracy and reproducibility. On the other hand, because of the higher reproducibility (&#x0003e;74%), we concluded that amplification from 30 pg RNA collected from 15 MCs would be suitable for the practical analysis of tissue MCs. Based on these results, we set our goal in this study to acquire gene expression profiles of MCs pooled from different regions. To minimize the influence of cell-to-cell variations within the same class and potential amplification artifacts, we prepared three sets of 15 MCs for each region and compared genes with significantly different expression between MCs from the different regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). We chose stomach as the source organ, since we can isolate two kinds of MCs from the mucosa (mMC) and the submucosa (sMC) regions of the same sections, and mMCs and sMCs have been suspected to be different in several MC properties such as protease expression profile and sensitivity to safranin staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Gene expression profiles of sMCs and mMCs from stomach tissue</bold>.

We prepared three sets of 15 MCs for each region, extracted their RNA and individually amplified them (sMC<sub>1</sub>, sMC<sub>2</sub>, sMC<sub>3</sub>, and mMC<sub>1</sub>, mMC<sub>2</sub>, mMC<sub>3</sub>). To improve the recovery of the extraction of as little as 30 pg of RNA, we used 'poly G' as a carrier, which does not interfere with the following RNA amplification or hybridization of the amplified product to the array (data not shown). To examine the effects of nonspecifically amplified artifact products, we performed the RNA extraction/amplification procedure without adding microdissected cells ("no cell") as a negative control (described in "<italic>Materials and methods</italic>"). The amplified RNAs of sMCs, mMCs and the "no cell" control were separately hybridized to a murine microarray. The signal values in the "no cell" sample were low in general and similar to the background levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). The scatter plots of the samples independently prepared within the same group (e.g. sMC<sub>1 </sub>vs sMC<sub>2</sub>) showed a similar expression pattern; the average correlation coefficient for all probe-sets was 0.945 &#x000b1; 0.004 and 0.893 &#x000b1; 0.019 in sMCs and mMCs, respectively (<italic>n </italic>= 3). In contrast, the average correlation coefficient between sMCs and mMCs was 0.752 &#x000b1; 0.034 (<italic>n </italic>= 3), which was much lower than those within the same group, suggesting that their gene expression patterns are different.</p><p>We further evaluated the accuracy and reproducibility of our method by other comprehensive analyses (hierarchical clustering analysis and principal component analysis [PCA]) using all probe sets. Microarray data obtained from sMCs, mMCs, skin-derived MCs, peritoneal MCs, BMMCs and non-MCs (macrophages and fibroblasts) were applied to these analyses. We first checked whether the amplification process in our method affects the global expression profile due to non-linear amplification. The results from the BMMC samples using RNA prepared by the standard protocol (BMMC-std) or the amplification method (BMMC-amp) were subjected to these analyses. Both hierarchical clustering analysis and PCA revealed that microarray data from BMMC-std and BMMC-amp were clustered in the same group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>), suggesting that the global similarity in gene expression profiles is maintained during the amplification process. We next examined the similarity of expression patterns in three independent sMC or mMC samples. Upon clustering analysis and PCA, sMC<sub>1&#x02013;3 </sub>and mMC<sub>1&#x02013;3 </sub>were clustered in the same group, respectively. PCA also showed that the expression profiles of sMCs, mMCs and BMMCs are mutually different (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Global gene expression analysis of sMC<sub>1&#x02013;3 </sub>and mMC<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub></bold>.

The tissue-derived MCs (stomach MCs and skin MCs) were clustered separately from peritoneal MCs and BMMCs. These results may reflect different properties between tissue-derived MCs with firm adhesion to the neighboring cells and floating MCs without a tight contact. As to the similarity of MCs with fibroblasts and macrophages, it is reasonable that fibroblasts are most distant from MCs and macrophages are closer to MCs as a leukocyte family.</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of microarray results by real time RT-PCR analysis</title><p>We next investigated whether the hybridization signals of known marker genes specific for sMCs and mMCs showed the expected expression trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The mMC-specific genes, mast cell protease 1 (<italic>Mcpt1</italic>) and 2 (<italic>Mcpt2</italic>) showed higher values in mMCs, while the sMC-specific marker genes, mast cell protease 4 (<italic>Mcpt4</italic>) and chymase 2 (<italic>Cma2</italic>), showed higher signal values in sMCs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. On the other hand, MC-common markers such as kit oncogene (<italic>Kit</italic>) and Fc&#x003b5; receptor (<italic>Fcer1a</italic>) showed significant signal values with no bias between mMCs and sMCs. To further evaluate the results, we measured the expression levels of these marker genes by real-time RT-PCR using RNA from the independently isolated MCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). Moreover, we randomly selected three genes showing 'mMC-biased' expression and another three genes showing 'sMC-biased' expression; expression of these genes in MCs has not been reported previously (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>).

The expression level of each gene was normalized by its level in BMMCs, which are cultured MCs with so-called 'immature' properties, and the selected genes were classified into seven clusters using the <italic>k</italic>-means clustering algorithm (CL1-7; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). We also classified the genes into functional categories, and the representative genes are listed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Among them, 666 genes (52.4%) showed sMC-biased expression (<italic>CL1-3</italic>); in 78% (519 genes) of sMC-rich genes, the expression levels were relatively low in BMMCs and augmented in sMC (<italic>CL1&#x00026;2</italic>). For example, the expression level of <italic>Mcpt4 </italic>was relatively low in BMMCs, and if the expression profile of BMMCs reflects the immature properties of MC progenitors, <italic>Mcpt4 </italic>can be concluded to be induced during the final maturation into sMCs. Interestingly, the sMC marker genes <italic>Mcpt5 </italic>and <italic>Mcpt6 </italic>were classified into <italic>CL2/3</italic>, suggesting that these genes were expressed to some extent in 'immature' BMMCs, but their expression was suppressed during maturation into mMCs.

The <italic>Notch4 </italic>gene product is a member of the Notch family, consisting of transmembrane receptors which are activated by cell surface ligands on adjacent cells. Recent studies have suggested that Notch signaling is involved in lymphocyte and mast cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We first confirmed that <italic>Notch4 </italic>expression is significantly higher in the separately pooled sMCs than mMCs by real-time RT-PCR (data not shown). We next investigated whether the Notch4 protein is exclusively present in sMCs by immunostaining of stomach tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). Notch4 signals were detected in the nucleus-like structures of sMCs but not in those of mMCs. Furthermore, Notch4 signals were also found in the skin MCs, which were adjacently clustered with sMCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). These results show that Notch4 is present in sMCs but not in mMCs, and suggest that Notch4 participates in sMC-specific transcription of Notch-target genes, which may be required for some sMC functions. In hematopoietic cells, it has been reported that constitutively active Notch4 promotes the expansion of progenitor cells and inhibits myeloid differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Since Notch ligands have been shown to exist in connective tissues such as skin dermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], it will be interesting to explore whether Notch4 plays a role in the differentiation of sMCs and the maintenance of sMC functions.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Immunohistochemical analysis of Notch4 and Ptgr1 in sMCs and mMCs in stomach tissue</bold>.

Although it has been reported that the pathways of eicosanoid synthesis differ among the different MC subclasses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], our results suggest that the inactivation system of eicosanoids also varies among the MC subclasses. <italic>Ptgr1 </italic>expression was found to be significantly higher in the separately pooled mMCs by real-time RT-PCR (data not shown). We also examined Ptgr1 expression in stomach sections by immunostaining. Signals for the Ptgr1 protein were found in granule-like structures of mMCs in the stomach mucosa but not in sMCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>), suggesting that the Ptgr1 enzyme may be released from mMCs upon degranulation. Since PGE<sub>2 </sub>plays critical roles in the maintenance of gut homeostasis through mucosal protection and inhibition of acid secretion, it is possible that when activated, mMCs negatively regulate the cytoprotective actions of PGE<sub>2 </sub>through rapid inactivation by Ptgr1.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene expression pattern of extracellular matrix components, adhesion molecules, and cytoskeletal proteins in sMCs and mMCs</title><p>MC phenotypes have been shown to depend on their interactions with the surrounding extracellular matrices (ECMs) and neighboring cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. One of the most remarkable findings in this study is the difference in gene expression of ECM protein components, adhesion molecules, and cytoskeletal proteins, which may reflect functional adaptation of each type of MC to the mucosal or submucosal environment in the stomach (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). mMCs express genes for mucosa-specific ECM proteins such as <italic>Muc1 </italic>(Mucin) and <italic>Tff1 </italic>(Trefoil factor), while sMCs express genes for conventional ECM proteins such as <italic>Col4a </italic>(procollagen) and <italic>Lama2 </italic>(laminin). Moreover, sMCs express genes for adhesion molecules such as <italic>Alcam </italic>and <italic>Vcam1</italic>, and genes for ordinary cytoskeletal proteins such as <italic>Acta2 </italic>(actin), while mMCs express desmosome-component genes such as <italic>Dsc2 </italic>(desmocollin) and <italic>Dsg2 </italic>(desmoglein), and genes for keratin intermediate filaments such as <italic>Krt8 </italic>and <italic>Krt19</italic>. Desmosomes were reported to be present in the stomach epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and it was found that desmosome-like structures are detected in a particular type of MC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It is thus possible that mMCs interact with adjacent epithelia through desmosomal adhesion in the stomach. In contrast, sMCs appear to interact with neighboring cells via adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1, ALCAM and VE-cadherin (<italic>Vcam1</italic>, <italic>Alcam1 </italic>and <italic>Cdh5</italic>). Since these adhesion molecules have been shown to be involved in dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], such molecule-mediated interactions with submucosal cells may be critical to maintain the functional and morphological properties of sMCs. Indeed, it should be noted that most sMCs are variable in shape, and are often stretched and winding as compared with mMCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We established a method of RNA amplification from pooled intact MCs isolated from frozen tissue sections, which enables us to conveniently obtain the global gene expression pattern of MCs from various tissues, organs, and species including humans.

To visualize MCs, the sections were fixed with carnoy's fixative, and immersed in toluidine blue using the following protocol: carnoy's fixative for 1 min, RNase-free water for 10 sec, toluidine blue (0.5% in 0.12N hydrochloric acid) for 5 sec, RNase-free water for 10 sec, 70% ethanol for 15 sec, and 100% ethanol for 15 sec three times; the sections were then vacuumed for 10 min to dry. Each single MC was microdissected from the sections using a patch pipette, and 15 cells were collected with an LCM Cap using the PixCell Ile Laser Capture Microdissection System (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA). As a negative control, LCM Caps just put on tissue sections without MCs were subjected to the same protocols (no cell). Fifteen microdissected MCs were homogenized in denaturing buffer of RNeasy mini kits. Twenty nanograms of poly G (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) was added to the lysate as a nucleic acid carrier, and total RNA was extracted. Fifty picograms of BMMC total RNA (BMMC-amp) and total RNAs extracted from sMCs in the stomach submucosa, mMCs in the stomach mucosa and skin MCs in the ear dermis were amplified and labeled using the three-round amplification method, and were hybridized to U74Av2 Murine Genome Array (Affymetrix).
