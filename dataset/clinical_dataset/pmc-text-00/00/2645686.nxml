For a solid tumor to grow in a confined space defined by the surrounding tissue, it must overcome the resulting compressive forces. It has been shown that tumors and their associated stroma are mechanically stiffer than the corresponding normal host tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004632-Gieni1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and that mechanical compression in such an environment can collapse blood and lymphatic vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004632-Padera1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our understanding of how this compression directly influences tumor growth is limited. Various hypotheses have been proposed regarding the involvement of mechanical stresses in tumor development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004632-Eaves1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004632-Young1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, and Helmlinger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004632-Helmlinger1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> conducted the first quantification of spheroid growth inhibition in agarose gels. They found that human colon carcinoma spheroids can grow to a maximum size of 400 &#x000b5;m (diameter) in 0.5&#x00025; (w/v) agarose, but only 50 &#x000b5;m in 1.0&#x00025; agarose (which is less compliant). This was associated with an increase in cell packing and a decrease in cell proliferation. They also showed that such inhibition of tumor growth can be reversed by releasing the spheroids from the gel. Yet several key questions remain unanswered, including: (1) What is the nature of the stress field around growing tumor spheroids? (2) Can local solid stress distribution affect the shape of tumor spheroids? (3) Does solid stress distribution also affect cell phenotype in different regions of individual spheroids? (4) What is the intracellular pathway that regulates the solid stress-induced phenotypic change(s)? These questions are critical for a fundamental understanding of solid tumor growth dynamics.</p><p>In this study, we show that the accumulating solid stress in agarose gels around growing tumor spheroids (non-metastatic murine mammary carcinoma 67NR cells unless stated otherwise) can be measured using co-embedded fluorescent micro-beads (diameter&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 &#x000b5;m) as markers for strain in the gel: agarose gels are resistant to degradation by cancer cell proteinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004632-Deryugina1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and thus allow studies of solid stress accumulation independent of cell invasion. We demonstrate that the shape of the solid stress field dictates the shape of tumor spheroids and that this effect is due to suppression of cell proliferation and induction of cell apoptosis in regions of high solid stress. Finally, we elucidate the molecular mechanism for the solid stress-induced apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Growing tumor spheroids progressively compress the surrounding matrix</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004632-g001">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref> shows the growth of a typical tumor spheroid (green) co-embedded with micro-beads (red) in 0.5&#x00025; agarose gel for 30 days (see experimental setup in Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004632.s002">Fig. S1<italic>A</italic></xref>).

Although empirical mathematical models such as the well-known Gompertzian growth curve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004632-Laird1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and the more recent &#x0201c;universal growth law&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004632-Guiot1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004632-Retsky1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> can predict the enlargement of many solid tumors with good accuracy, they do not explicitly consider cell dynamics inside the tumors. In particular, the invariable emergence of a plateau phase after tumors have reached a certain size has never been satisfactorily explained. As most solid tumors larger than 1 mm in diameter induce angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004632-Folkman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, nutrient or oxygen depletion should not limit tumor growth. Our study shows that growth-induced solid stress can affect cell phenotype, and suggests that there may be a &#x0201c;dynamic equilibrium&#x0201d; of proliferation and apoptosis that maintains tumor size in the plateau phase, as proposed by Holmgren et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004632-Holmgren1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The apoptotic cell death caused by such stress is of particular interest.

Our results suggest that inhomogeneities in the mechanical properties of the confining tissue can guide morphological changes in tumor growth, independent of cell migration, by inducing apoptosis in regions of high compressive stress and allowing proliferation in regions of low stress. Furthermore, the compression-induced apoptosis occurs via the mitochondrial pathway, a regulatory control mechanism that cancer cells with elevated Bcl-2 activity might escape to produce more malignant tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Non-metastatic murine mammary carcinoma cells 67NR were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and were used for most of the experiments in this study.
