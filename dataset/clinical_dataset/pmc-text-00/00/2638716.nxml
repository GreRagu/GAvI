Some 30% of community-dwelling adults aged 65 and over are reported to fall each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><bold>1</bold></xref>]. Serious falls also occur in fit and active older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><bold>2</bold></xref>]. Several empirical studies demonstrate that moderate intensity exercise is an effective intervention strategy for preventing falls in older adults [3&#x02013;5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><bold>6</bold></xref><bold>&#x02013;</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><bold>8</bold></xref>]. Other studies have shown that injuries, because of a fall, are reduced after the implementation of an exercise programme [9, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><bold>10</bold></xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><bold>11</bold></xref>]. However, exercise is uncommon among older adults. For example, in a large representative sample of the UK, 40% of over 50 years of age reported less exercise than is considered necessary to maintain good health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><bold>12</bold></xref>]. Levels of physical activity are reportedly lower in South Asian groups than among the general population in the UK [13, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><bold>14</bold></xref><bold>&#x02013;</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><bold>17</bold></xref>], and therefore the potential benefits from exercise in terms of fall prevention are not realised in this group.</p><p>Little literature exists with regard to older adults&#x02019; views about exercise and physical activity in relation to fall prevention and where there is research, most is very recent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><bold>18</bold></xref><bold>&#x02013;</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><bold>23</bold></xref>]. Collectively, these studies suggest that if older adults do not believe that they are at risk of falling, they are unlikely to take up measures to prevent falls. However, the focus of these studies tends to be adults aged 65 and over and usually Caucasian populations. Little is known about the beliefs of adults in the decade of retirement, i.e. those aged 60&#x02013;70 years and even less about South Asian people's beliefs in this area.</p><p>Working with those entering old age could potentially produce substantial health benefits. This may bring about a favourable shift in the overall fall risk-factor distribution in the population with the longer term aim of changing population health [24]. It is important to improve and build upon our understanding of what young older adults think about falls and exercise for fall prevention. This will inform our understanding of how prevention programmes could or should be designed and presented to young older adults.</p><sec id="S1-1"><title>Study design</title><p>An ethnographic approach provides a framework for facilitating the incorporation of multiple voices and perspectives. First, participant observation was conducted for several months, totalling 60 hours to familiarise the researcher with the field. Second, 15 focus groups were conducted and analysed. Third, 40 semi-structured interviews were conducted to incorporate more breadth and depth to the emergent findings. Steps 2 and 3 constitute the main data pool on which this article is based.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Method</title><p>A semi-structured interview guide provided a flexible framework for questioning for both focus groups and interviews. At the beginning of the focus groups/interviews the facilitator/interviewer clarified the meaning of exercise and physical activity. Physical activity was defined as any bodily movement produced by the skeletal muscles resulting in energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><bold>25</bold></xref>], for example organised activity such as dance, sports or informal activity such as walking, swimming and gardening. Exercise was defined as a subset of physical activity that is planned, structured and involves repetitive bodily movements with the purpose of improving some aspect of physical fitness, for example muscular strength and endurance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><bold>25</bold></xref>]. Therefore, sport and walking can also be classed as exercise.</p><p>The participants were categorised as active, less active and sedentary on self-reported levels of exercise and physical activity using Department of Health guidelines for regular activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><bold>26</bold></xref>]. Active category constitutes 30 min of at least moderate intensity physical activity a day, on 5 or more days a week and &#x0003c;30 min a week is deemed as sedentary category [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><bold>26</bold></xref>]. A less active category was added as the distinction between active and sedentary was too extreme.</p><sec id="S2-2"><title>Sampling and recruiting</title><p>Adults aged 60&#x02013;70 years were recruited in the North West of England. Potential participants for focus groups and interviews were identified through fieldwork observation. Purposive sampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><bold>27</bold></xref>] was used to recruit participants to both focus groups and in-depth interviews, to acquire access to a full range of beliefs with regard to falls and exercise for fall prevention. The sample was selected to include adults with very different experiences of participation or non-participation in exercise and physical activity, but all were asked about exercise and physical activity in relation to fall prevention. Translated literature and interpreters were used with South Asian participants.</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Analysis</title><p>Data analysis and classification followed the framework analysis approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28"><bold>28</bold></xref>]. This method of analysis was specifically designed to facilitate systematic analysis of qualitative data and has the ability to summarise and classify data within a thematic framework. Data analysis and collection were undertaken simultaneously. The themes were compared and contrasted within and across groups. The ATLAS/ti5.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><bold>29</bold></xref>] qualitative analysis software programme assisted in coding, cross-referencing, storage and retrieval of data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Findings and discussion</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> presents the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants in the focus groups and interviews.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Sample</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Interview type</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No.</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean age</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reported activity levels<sup>a</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="6" colspan="1">Focus groups</td><td rowspan="3" colspan="1">Caucasian</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">58</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">44 females</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Active: 24 (41.4%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 males</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Less active: 26 (44.8%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sedentary: 8 (13.8%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="3" colspan="1">South Asian</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">29</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 females</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Active: 14 (48.3%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 males</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Less active: 12 (41.4%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sedentary: 3 (10.3%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6" colspan="1">In-depth interviews</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Caucasian</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">23</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 females</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Active: 10 (43.5%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 males</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Less active: 9 (39.1%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sedentary: 4 (17.4%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">South Asian</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 females</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Active: 8 (47.1%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 males</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Less active: 4 (23.5%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sedentary: 5 (29.4%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="T1TFN1"><p><bold><sup>a</sup></bold>Using DoH guidelines of regular activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><bold>26</bold></xref>] and adding a less active category (as the distinction between the active and sedentary are too extreme).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><sec id="S3-1"><title>Confusion about exercise and physical activity</title><p>There were, perhaps unexpectedly, considerable similarities between the Caucasians and South Asians in the way they talked about falls, exercise and fall prevention.

However, this is the first study to identify such beliefs in South Asian older adults.</p></sec><sec id="S3-2"><title>Too young to fall</title><p>Many participants perceived themselves to be too young to have a fall and that falls happened to those people who were much older then they were:<disp-quote><p>I think that's after 80s [having a fall], when people are getting older.

They were more motivated to perform exercise for this reason. This appeared to stem from a fear of falling, which promoted a belief that they may fall again. With hindsight, this South Asian female reflects on this point:<disp-quote><p>Yes it would motivate me [to perform exercise for fall prevention]&#x02009;&#x02026;&#x02009;by falling it has frightened me and that prevented me going to do exercise because I thought I might fall again. (I31: South Asian female, 62 years: Sedentary)</p></disp-quote></p><p>A small minority of participants feared falling despite awareness of the potential benefits of exercise in fall prevention. They felt they were not in a position to undertake exercise because of existing health issues and limited mobility:<disp-quote><p>I can't [exercise] because of my arthritis, you know, I think I might fall. (I40: South Asian female, 62 years: Sedentary)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Thus, exercise was sometimes associated with a perceived risk of falling. Other studies have reported poor physical health and mobility issues as general barriers to both the initiation and maintenance of exercise and physical activity in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><bold>30</bold></xref><bold>&#x02013;</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><bold>32</bold></xref>] and our findings reinforce these.</p><p>Clearly, beliefs about perceived and actual fears can result in activity restrictions and the motivation to initiate exercise and physical activity. This is consistent with the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><bold>33</bold></xref><bold>&#x02013;</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35"><bold>35</bold></xref>]. However, once it was explained that strength and balance exercises could help to reduce falls, the above lady was more motivated to perform exercises. Therefore, how health promotion messages about fall prevention are presented to older people will influence exercise and physical activity uptake.</p></sec><sec id="S3-4"><title>Fall prevention exercises unnecessary</title><p>Older adults who perceived themselves to be fit and healthy, believed fall prevention exercises were not necessary for them personally:<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; I just feel I&#x02019;m not in a position &#x02026; that I&#x02019;m very lucky in that I don't need to [exercise to prevent falls].

Maybe if I was struggling with something, I&#x02019;d say, &#x0201c;well yeah, I&#x02019;ll go and see if I can get a wee bit of exercise&#x0201d;, but there again, I might say &#x0201c;I&#x02019;ll go to the physio, they might move those bones for me&#x0201d;, rather than go to a sports or leisure centre. (I7: Caucasian female, 65 years: Active)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Generally, young older adults with no fall history did not acknowledge their risk of falling:<disp-quote><p>I wouldn't think about things like that, to be honest, when I&#x02019;m going to fall&#x02026;&#x02009;.

Community-dwelling inpatients, prior to discharge, felt there was no need to exercise because they were unlikely to fall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19"><bold>19</bold></xref>]. Generally, fall prevention advice is seen as useful in principle, but of no personal relevance for them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><bold>21</bold></xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><bold>23</bold></xref>]. However, older adults are motivated to participate in strength and balance training by a wide range of perceived benefits, for example improved health, and not just reduction of fall risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><bold>21</bold></xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><bold>23</bold></xref>]. Similar attitudes to fall prevention interventions are seen across a number of European countries and contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><bold>22</bold></xref>]. Findings from this study are congruent, but extend to younger older adults and to South Asian populations. Hence, emphasising the social aspects of leading a healthy, active life and improving strength and balance might be more acceptable and effective than advice on fall prevention.</p></sec><sec id="S3-5"><title>Fatalism</title><p>Both Caucasian and South Asian older adults felt that falls were a (biological) inevitability, a natural consequence of ageing:<disp-quote><p>&#x02026; but sometimes you can't help it [fall] because of your age &#x02026; If that person is old, it is that age.

Accepting that a fall is the will of God or Allah may become a significant barrier to behaviour change. These quotes illustrate that if you believe you have little control over what happens to you, you may see little point in exercising, which may not bode well for health promotion strategies. If falls are believed to be inevitable, unavoidable or unpreventable, then older people are unlikely to initiate exercise regimes that may help in prevention.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings from this study suggest that fall prevention takes a low priority among both Caucasian and South Asian 60&#x02013;70 year olds. Neither group recognised falls to be a serious health issue. Most young older adults appear not to be motivated to exercise purely for the prevention of falls. Falling is viewed as a negative image of ageing and considered as a physical weakness of the body and a consequence of poor health, which was variously defined by the participants. Therefore, exercising purely for the purpose of preventing a fall is seen as unnecessary when there are more general health issues. Hence, promoting exercise and physical activity for fall prevention is probably not the best strategy to encourage regular exercise and physical activity. Promoting the positive aspects of activity in later life, such as positive well-being, may be more appropriate and appears to be the way forward in increasing exercise and physical activity with regard to preventing falls in this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><bold>36</bold></xref>].</p><p>Those who had fallen were more likely to recognise that they were at risk of future falls and thus when told that exercise might reduce that risk were more likely to say they would consider taking up a suitable fall prevention programme. However, fears of falling also acted as a barrier to taking exercise and physical activity and could mitigate against undertaking further activity.</p><p>There appear, in these samples, to be more similarities then dissimilarities between Caucasian and South Asian older adults&#x02019; talk about uptake of exercise for fall prevention. However, there appear to be some differences in beliefs in the area of fatalism. Holding fatalistic beliefs means that falls are often seen as an unpreventable event. Older adults who hold such beliefs seem to attribute falls to the ageing process or due to poor health. Therefore, falls are perceived to be an occurrence out of their control, which can lead to an acceptance of the inevitable.</p><p>Whilst we may find differences in the future, the similarities seen in this data set could be due to the specific groups who attended focus groups and interviews. In one of the areas in which we recruited considerable health promotion work had been undertaken, which may have influenced the beliefs and health behaviours of the respondents. Our findings could also be a result of the demand characteristics of the data collection procedure, but there is no direct evidence to suggest that this is the case.</p><p>Hence, it seems that fall prevention <italic>per se</italic> should not be the headline focus of health promotion strategies for this age group. The wider benefits of exercise and leading active, healthy lifestyles should be promoted and fall prevention should be mentioned in terms of secondary benefits rather than the primary aim.</p><p>Future research will need to investigate further the beliefs and attitudes of younger older people and people from ethnic minority groups towards health promotion in general and fall prevention in particular and compare these to other large scale surveys of attitudes and beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><bold>23</bold></xref>]. However, the findings presented here begin to address the important and currently under-researched area of the views of ethnic minority groups.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Key points</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A qualitative study showed that both Caucasian and South Asian young older adults are generally not motivated to initiate or maintain exercise purely to help prevent falls</p></list-item><list-item><p>Both Caucasian and South Asian young older adults tend not to acknowledge their risk of falls</p></list-item><list-item><p>More similarities than dissimilarities seem to exist between Caucasian and South Asian older adults in their beliefs about falls and exercise for fall prevention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fall prevention should not necessarily be the focus of health promotion strategies, but the peripheral benefits of exercise and leading active healthy lifestyles should be promoted.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="afn237_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="afn237_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank everyone who took time to participate in the research study and to the staff of statutory and voluntary services for their time, support and facilitation.</p></ack><sec id="S6"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was conducted as part of a PhD study.
