Deaths from liver diseases have risen in the post-HAART era, yet some cross-sectional studies have suggested that HAART use is associated with improved fibrosis rates. In a retrospective cohort of 533 HIV mono-infected and 127 HIV/HCV co-infected patients, followed between January 1991 and July 2005 at a university-based HIV clinic, we investigated the relationship between cumulative HAART exposure and hepatic fibrosis, as measured by the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI). We used a novel methodological approach to estimate the dose-response relationship of the effect of HAART exposure on APRI. HAART was associated with increasing APRI over time in HIV/HCV co-infected patients suggesting that they may be experiencing cumulative hepatotoxicity from antiretrovirals. The estimated median change (95&#x00025; confidence interval) in APRI per one year of HAART intake was of &#x02212;0.46&#x00025; (&#x02212;1.61&#x00025; to 0.71&#x00025;) in HIV mono-infected compared to 2.54&#x00025; (&#x02212;1.77&#x00025; to 7.03&#x00025;) in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Similar results were found when the direct effect of HAART intake since the last visit was estimated on the change in APRI. HAART use associated is with increased APRI in patients with HIV/HCV co-infection. Therefore treatment for HCV infection may be required to slow the growing epidemic of end-stage liver disease in this population.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) there have been dramatic reductions of morbidity and mortality from virtually all causes among HIV-infected persons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Hogg1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Palella1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> One of the glaring exceptions to this trend is liver-related deaths which now represent one of the leading causes of death among HIV-infected individuals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Bica1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Tatsunami1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> Much of this excess mortality has been driven by the epidemic of Hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection affecting more than 30&#x00025; of HIV-infected patients in developed countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Zylberberg1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> HCV progresses more rapidly in patients co-infected with HIV.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Graham1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Soto1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> In addition, non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis is increasingly being recognized as an important cause of liver disease in HIV-infected persons which may contribute to liver-related morbidity in the absence of HCV infection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Sulkowski1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref></p><p>A number of cross-sectional studies have suggested that HAART, especially regimens containing protease inhibitors (PI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Benhamou1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-MarineBarjoan1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, is associated with improved fibrosis rates.

Since 1989, a computerized database on all patients has been maintained into which demographic data, clinical diagnoses (both AIDS and non-AIDS), laboratory and prescription information are prospectively entered. Any changes in antiretroviral medications are reviewed at each clinic visit by a physician and/or clinic pharmacist and recorded. This study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Board. As this was a retrospective review of electronic records, we did not obtain informed consent from study participants, in accordance with regulations of our intuitional ethics review board which approved the study.</p><p>All participants were HIV sero-positive (determined by positive ELISA with confirmatory Western blot), attended the clinic at least twice between January 1991 and December 2004, and did not have a clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis at baseline. Subjects were categorized by HIV/HCV co-infection or by HIV infection alone. Patients with both HCV and chronic hepatitis B virus infections were excluded. HCV testing was performed using ELISA followed by confirmatory testing of positive samples with recombinant immuno-blot assays. Patients were followed until July 2005 or censored on their last clinic visit if lost to follow-up. Ten patients were censored when they received specific HCV therapy and a further 13 were excluded from the analysis due to missing information at each visit on at least one variable of interest. The analyzed cohort was thus comprised of 660 subjects monitored over 14 years: 533 who were HIV infected and 127 who were co-infected with HCV.</p><p>Baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory variables, as well as follow-up data for 6-month intervals, were extracted from the database. Concurrent measures (taken not more than 7 days apart) of AST and platelets were used to calculate APRI values. For each 6-month interval the most recent APRI value was used. CD4&#x0002b; T-cell counts were measured by flow cytometry. Plasma HIV viral load measurements were performed using Chiron branched chain DNA assays (standardized to Quantiplex version 3.0 equivalent as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Murphy1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Exposure and covariate assessment</title><p>The exposure of interest was HAART intake, calculated as the total number of years on HAART up to the last APRI measurement in each interval. HAART was defined as at least three antiretrovirals taken concurrently for more than one day. Triple nucleoside regimens were considered as HAART if they contained abacavir. We considered the following variables that may confound the relationship between HAART and liver function: age, gender, region of birth, transmission risk factors (men who have sex with men (MSM) and injection drug use), calendar year at study entry, use of HAART prior to baseline, CD4&#x0002b; T-cell counts, CD8&#x0002b; T-cell counts, and plasma HIV RNA (log copies/ml).

Estimation of the density of cumulative HAART is straightforward if a parametric form for the continuous part of the distribution is assumed. We used a Box-Cox transformation of positive cumulative doses with power parameter selected by maximum likelihood to render the data more approximately normal.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Box1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> The transformed doses were modeled under a normal density whose mean was a linear function of age, sex, region of birth, year of study entry, use of HAART prior to baseline, time in cohort, co-infection status, injection drug use, MSM, CD4&#x0002b; T-cell counts, CD8&#x0002b; T-cell counts, and HIV RNA, as well as interactions between co-infection status and each of CD4&#x0002b; T-cell count, HIV RNA, injection drug use, and MSM. To estimate the probability of having a non-zero dose of cumulative HAART in any interval, a logistic model to the binary (HAART&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0, HAART&#x0003e;0) dose data was used, including the same predictors are in the continuous-dose portion of the mixture distribution.

No previous study has focused on repeated balancing of patient covariates over time in order to estimate dose-response curves.</p><p>Our study used a large clinical cohort with data collection and follow-up spanning over a decade. With the availability of detailed clinical and laboratory information, we were able to adjust for many potential baseline and follow-up confounders. In addition, care was taken to ensure that the impact of time, both in terms of the duration of HIV infection and calendar time, was taken into account in the analysis. We have thus shown that HAART appears to have a negligible effect on liver fibrosis progression as measured by the APRI in HIV-infected patients, but is associated with an increase in fibrosis progression in HIV/HCV co-infected individuals. This finding contrasts somewhat with our previous results obtained using standard mixed models where we observed that HAART was associated with fibrosis progression in both groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-AlMohri2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref></p><sec id="s4a"><title>Potential limitations of the present study</title><p>As with all models for observational data, approaches such as the GPS require assumptions to be appropriately specified.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Robins1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Robins2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> The GPS approach has been shown to be a powerful tool in the analysis of direct effects of continuous dose in cross-sectional<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Yasui1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and longitudinal data (<italic>Estimation of Dose-Response Functions for Longitudinal Data using The Generalized Propensity Score</italic> by EEM Moodie and DA Stephen (2009)) however the methodology does not control for unmeasured confounding variables. Diagnostic plots (not shown) suggested that the constructed GPS appropriately broke the confounding relationships for those variables that were recorded. It is nevertheless possible that estimates are confounded by factors for which data were unavailable such as alcohol use, the presence of other infections, and the use of hepato-toxic medications. We surmise that patients who use alcohol heavily are less likely to maintain a HAART regimen than patients who do not consume alcohol. Under this assumption, our results likely underestimate the increase in APRI caused by HAART use. Future work will include an analysis of a prospective co-infection cohort on whom alcohol intake information is available.</p><p>A further complication of longitudinal data such as these is that time-varying variables such as CD4 cell counts could potentially act as mediating variables in addition to being confounding variables. In such cases, when the total (direct and indirect) effect of cumulative dose is to be estimated, the use of marginal structural models is typically preferred over adjusting for such variables in a regression model, which is, in effect, the result of the GPS approach. However in the present study, the highly varied number of visits per individual in the study (recall that approximately 50&#x00025; of individuals present for five visits or fewer while one fifth of the participants present to more than 10) and the absence of a biologically meaningful baseline time make the marginal structural model approach less appealing. Furthermore, the implementation of the inverse weighting required for marginal structural models is not straightforward when dose densities are mixtures distributions with continuous components, as in the present study.</p><p>We therefore proceeded with the GPS analysis, and were reassured by the concordance of conclusions between the estimation of the direct effect of HAART intake since the last visit on change in APRI and the analysis that examined the effects of cumulative HAART on APRI. We note that the primary analysis which investigated the effect of HAART received between two clinic visits on the change in APRI between the two visits after intake of that HAART does in fact provide an estimate of causal parameter. However in the analysis in which we considered the effect of cumulative HAART on APRI, the relationship estimated captures a combination of the effect of the most recent dose of HAART and additionally the effect of HAART consumed at previous intervals that is not mediated through the time-varying confounding variables. We suspect that this leads to an underestimate of the total effect of cumulative HAART intake on liver function, however this relationship is difficult to surmise as the interactions between immunological factors such as lymphocyte counts and viral load on the components of the APRI are not fully understood.</p><p>Another potential limitation of our study was the use of APRI as a surrogate marker for liver fibrosis. Both AST and platelets may be subject to variations due to factors other than liver disease progression. Ideally, the evolution of hepatic fibrosis would be assessed by multiple liver biopsies in a large cohort. However, the acceptability, cost, and risk associated with multiple biopsies make such a study impractical. Liver biopsy itself is an imperfect measure as it is subject to high sampling variability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Maharaj1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and considerable intra- and inter-observer variability in the histological assessment of the biopsy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004517-Bedossa1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> Therefore, in the absence of even a perfect invasive reference standard, non-invasive markers are more appealing to clinicians and patients alike.
