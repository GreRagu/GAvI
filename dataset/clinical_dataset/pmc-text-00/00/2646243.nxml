The Biomedical Informatics Research Collaborative was able to link genes and disorders using the Multi-threaded Clinical Vocabulary Server (MCVS) and natural language processing engine, whose output creates an ontology-network using the semantic encodings of the literature that is organized by these two terminologies. We identified relationships between (genes or proteins) and (diseases or drugs) as linked by metabolic functions and identified potentially novel functional relationships between, for example, genes and diseases (e.g. Article #1 ([Gene - IL27] = &#x0003e; {Enzyme - Dipeptidyl Carboxypeptidase 1}) and Article #2 ({Enzyme - Dipeptidyl Carboxypeptidase 1} &#x0003c; = [Disorder - Type II DM]) showing a metabolic link between IL27 and Type II DM).

We utilized SCT due to its value for the functional purposes of computation from the medical literature and the issues related to maintaining and delivering it for those purposes. SCT is maintained by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and is designed to represent all health and medical domains. Although very broad with over 360,000 concepts and 1.2 million relations it does not provide complete coverage of all medical content. The SCT modeling has been performed over more than a forty-year period and in the late 1990s SNOMED RT was merged with another large ontology, the Reed codes v3, developed in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Ontologies, to be useful for computation for practical tasks, need to be precise in two ways; firstly, they need to match as closely as possible our understanding of the natural world we wish to deal in. Ontologies need to be accurate and closely follow human understanding otherwise they create confusion in their design and their use. This means the ontology needs to be constructed with very close attention to the meanings of the terms used in it. Hence the names used in the ontology need to represent closely the understanding we have of the real world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Secondly the variety of linguistic "usage" of those terms needs to be explored to uncover the diversity of semantic roles of the terms and ensure that only those roles that are useful are included in the ontological modeling, and to remove ambiguity in the use of those roles. Precision of definition is particularly important in establishing the relationships between elements and identifying the fundamental atomic elements and how they combine or "fit together" systematically to form compositional expressions. Ontologies also consist of abstractions with each level of the ontology being more abstract as one moves up the hierarchy. This structure allows us to talk about the world at the different levels of abstraction we would experience outside the realm of the "machine". In using ontology for computation there are two basic forms of abstraction available, aggregation and generalization. Generalization hierarchies are used throughout SCT as the basic mechanisms for relating content. Aggregation hierarchies on the other hand have not been used properly but rather transposed so that they appear like generalization hierarchies.</p><p>SCT provides coverage for diagnoses, findings, procedures and testing. In one study SCT provided 92.3% coverage of common medical problems seen at the Mayo Clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has been used in subsequent studies for electronic quality monitoring.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]</p></sec><sec><title>HUGO</title><p>The <bold>Human Genome Organisation </bold>(HUGO) is an organization involved in the Human Genome Project, a project about mapping the human genome.

Much of the richness of this resource is not in a form that is easily amenable to computational analysis. Add to this the fact that no medical professional can read all of the medical literature and Natural language processing has the potential to unlock the knowledge within the medical literature. In this experiment we used the information from the NEJM, one of the premier medical journals, to determine if novel relationships could be identified between Genes, Proteins, Drugs and Disorders. These relationships are indeed prevalent and hold the potential to increase our understanding of human disease.</p><p>The validation by example is illustrated in the identification of a gene "FYN" identified in tissue as a marker for Giant Cell Myocarditis, which was identified also in our database and would have been available from previous literature a full two-years in advance of its identification in tissue and publication. The database not only identified the relationship of the "FYN" gene to Giant Cell Myocarditis but also to Viral Myocarditis which would have otherwise been considered "not known". Identification of new relationships that have been validated in tissue is just one form of validation of the content of the database. We are currently looking at all of the genes related to more than three cancers. In this analysis we have identified 10 genes related to thirty or more cancers, 72 genes related to twenty or more cancers and 191 genes related to ten or more cancers. Perhaps the common basis for transformation of cells to malignancies has already been published but remains "hidden" within the vast amounts of biomedical literature.</p><p>Biomedical Informatics has the potential to help us to discover novel genetic linkage to human disease. This can lead to benefits in patient care with more rapid knowledge discovery and translational research empowering clinical implementation of personalized/individualized medicine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We parsed the full-text content of the New England Journal of Medicine (1994&#x02013;2006) using our Multi-threaded Clinical Vocabulary Server (MCVS). The output of this technology creates an ontology-network using the semantic encodings of the literature that is organized by section of the article. In this effort we utilized a single Dell 2650 server with 8 GB of main memory and two processors. The configuration took one year to accomplish, but could have been done in 1/2 the time with two server and a quarter of the time with 4. The software is configured so that this scheme could continue indefinitely.</p><p>The indexing was done utilizing SNOMED-CT and the HUGO Ontologies. This provides robust indexing as SNOMED-CT has &#x0003e;370,000 concepts and &#x0003e;1,000,000 terms (in our lab we add another 790,000 terms to improve its clinical relevance) and HUGO has &#x0003e;26,000 human gene names. This concept based indexing represents a broad and consistent data infrastructure across articles from the literature.</p><p>We identified relationships between genes and functions, proteins and functions, diseases and functions and drugs and functions. Next, we matched these data sets across function, identifying functional relationships between proteins and diseases, for example. Further functional relationships were developed between genes and diseases, proteins and drugs, genes and drugs, and drugs and diseases. Next, we identified the disjoint sets where, for example, a gene and a disease match across function but have not been mentioned together in any previous NEJM journal article. Our goal was to identify synergy between articles within the literature indicating potential relationships between genes or proteins and drugs or diseases that have heretofore not been previously recognized. The database is searchable in all aspects such that a disease-oriented researcher could search the disease they are interested in and find all of the genes, proteins and drugs associated with that disease organized by function. Researchers could either access this information regarding known synergies (where the gene and disease have been mentioned in the same article) that verifies the utility of the algorithm or discontinuities (where the gene and disease have a functional relationship, however the two entities have never previously been mentioned in the same Journal Article). This may indicate the possibility of a novel relationship that can then be taken back to the bench for further definition, identification and research. Proteins and drugs, for example, that have a functional relationship but that have never been recognized to affect one another, may be substrate for further basic science analysis thereby leading to more rapid marker and treatment discovery. We see this as a potential method for improving the research productivity.</p><p>This program/exercise aims to support the development of novel clinical and translational methods that can encompass a wide range of techniques including new methods of phenotyping where one could use SNOMED CT to phenotype the patients described in this paper. New biomarkers for research are a potential output of this project (See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This project may also benefit clinical informatics for longitudinal studies that aim to rapidly look at specific associations that may lead to either additional retrospective analysis or prospective clinical trials. The special deliverables of this project are also an interface where one can search the already recognized (concordant) relationships, and also disjoint or previously undocumented relationships between genes or proteins and drugs or diseases (See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Free text searching will be available based on a gene, protein, disease, drug or function (See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). As organizing concepts are included, searching for classes (e.g. concepts like beta blockers for drugs or cardiovascular diseases) will be possible without having to articulate the individual sub-classes of information.
