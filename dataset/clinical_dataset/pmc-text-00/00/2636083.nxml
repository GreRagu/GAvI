Written and informedconsent of patients or parents and healthy controls was obtainedprior to inclusion in the study. The study was approved by ourinstitutional review board.</p><p>All cases with amblyopia, &#x0003e;2 diopters (D) of anisometropia,incomitance in the horizontal or vertical deviation, significantvertical deviation of &#x02265;5 prism diopters (PD) or significantoblique muscle overactions were excluded. Cases with previoushistory of strabismus surgery were also excluded. Controlswere emetropic or ametropic &#x0003c; 0.5D without anisometropia orintermittent or manifest deviation.</p><p>All subjects underwent a complete ophthalmic and orthopticassessment including cycloplegic refraction and full correctionof the refractive error if any. Measurement of the angle ofdeviation was obtained in all patients at distance (6 m) and near(33cm) in primary position with fixation on accommodativetargets employing the alternate prism bar cover test (PBCT)with appropriate spectacle correction based on retinoscopy.In patients with near distance disparity in measurements,they were repeated after unilateral patching for 6 h and using+3D lenses in front of each eye to distinguish true disparityfrom false and then to classify them according to Kushner&#x02032;sclassification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> of X(T).</p><p>Near stereoacuity was measured by Random dot, RandotStereotest (Stereo Optical Co, Chicago, IL) with subjectswearing polaroid spectacles. Test stereogram was held at adistance of 40 cm from the subject during testing. Patients withrefractive errors wore their spectacles under their polaroidlenses. Patients were asked to determine which circle ineach successive group appeared to &#x02033;pop out of the page&#x02033;.This procedure was repeated until two mistakes were madesuccessively. Threshold stereoacuity level was recorded inseconds of arc.</p><p>Distance stereoacuity was measured with polaroidstereoprojector apparatus (Pradovit, Germany) using specialpaired slides, with the patient standing at 6 m from the screenand wearing polaroid glasses. Slides used for measuringdistance stereoacuity have five geometrical shapes each ofa different level of distance stereo disparity of 200, 400, 660,800 and 933 arc seconds respectively [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>]. Slides in pairare placed in the carousel of the stereoprojector. Polaroiddissociation stereoprojector [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>] is a twin projectorinstrument used to dissociate the two eyes by using thephenomenon of polarization of light. The twin projectorsare provided with polaroid filters, which convert the non-polarized light into polarized light of particular orientation.The orientation of polarization is vertical in one projectorand horizontal in the other. The image by polarized light fallson the highly polished aluminum screen, which retains thepolarized nature of the light. The image is seen with polaroidglasses in which the polarized filters of appropriate orientationare incorporated. Thus the polarized glasses (filters over theprojector and polaroid goggles) allow the image carried bylight in a particular polarization and cut off the other imageand provide the dissociated images to the two eyes, despitethe two eyes being open.</p><p>The fusional vergences were measured for both distance(6 m) and near fixation (33 cm) with prism bar, afterneutralization of deviation. Prism strength was increasedslowly and stepwise and patient was asked to report when thefixation object appears double. The prism power was noted asthe break point and this was confirmed with the observationof the eye deviating out. The prism power was then reducedagain slowly and stepwise and the point at which the patientregained single vision was noted. This was recorded as therecovery point. Both convergence and divergence breakup andrecovery points were measured.</p><p>All patients underwent conventional strabismus surgery,consisting of either a bilateral lateral rectus (LR) recession(12 cases) or a monocular recession-resection procedure(17 cases) and two cases had unilateral LR recession. The amountof surgery was based on type and amount of exodeviation. Allsurgeries were performed by a single surgeon (PS). For thetrue divergence excess cases (2) and children operated undergeneral anesthesia (10), bilateral LR recession surgery was done.In all basic cases under peribulbar anesthesia (17) monocularrecession-resection was done. Unilateral LR recession was doneif deviation was less than 18 PD (2).</p><p>All subjects were examined at one week, one month, threemonths and six months after surgery. A minimum follow-upperiod of three months was required for inclusion in the study.However, all patients could complete six months follow-up.The following measurements were repeated: ocular deviations,stereoacuity and fusional vergences for both distance and near.Surgical outcome was defined as successful in motor terms ifthe postoperative deviation was less than 8 PD on PBCT, withpatient wearing required optical correction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 10 statisticalsoftware (PC version, USA). Probability value (<italic>P</italic> value) lessthan 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Descriptiveanalysis like mean, median, confidence intervals and standarddeviation was done for all the parameters. Independent samplestudent&#x02032;s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test whenever applicablewas used for comparison of various parameters between casesand controls.

Fourpatients were excluded due to previous surgery (2) andsignificant vertical deviation (2). Thirty-three age and sex-matched controls were evaluated. The mean age of cases was19.6 &#x000b1; 9.0 (range, 6 to 42) years and that of controls was 19.5 &#x000b1; 8.6(range, 8 to 40) years (<italic> P</italic>  = 0.9).

Mean amountof deviation (PD) in patients with X(T) was 39 &#x000b1; 10.4 (range, 18to 71) at distance and 37 &#x000b1; 9.6 (range, 25 to 71) at near.</p><p>Patients with X(T) performed significantly worse for bothdistance and near stereoacuity than normal subjects. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>shows the stereoacuity data for normal subjects and patientswith X(T). The mean distance stereoacuity of patients withX(T) was poorer than that of normal subjects (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).Preoperatively out of 31 cases, 12 (38.7%) were unable todemonstrate any distance stereoacuity. For statistical purposesthey were assigned a value of 2100 sec of arc. Because it is notbiased by the extremes, median value might be a more validmeasure for comparison between two groups. Postoperatively,significant improvement was seen in distance stereoacuity(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The improvement in stereoacuity was significant upto four weeks after which no significant improvement was seen.Preoperatively only three out of 31 cases (9%) demonstrated finedistance stereoacuity of 200 sec of arc. Postoperatively 12 cases(39%) with X(T) were able to demonstrate this level of distancestereoacuity. Of 31 patients distance stereoacuity improved in27 (87.1%), did not change in two (6.5%). Worsening was seenin two patients of which one patient developed consecutiveesotropia of 14 PD. These two patients worsened from 600 and200 sec of arc to 933 and 600 sec of arc respectively. The firstpatient was a 25-year-old male who had surgical motor successfrom 25 PD to 6 PD of X (T) and the other patient was a nine-year-old girl who developed consecutive esotropia of 14 PDfrom 35 PD of X (T). The amount of esotropia remained sameand was given prism therapy subsequently.</p><p>The X(T) patients in our study demonstrated poor nearstereoacuity, when compared with normal subjects, bothpreoperatively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and at six months postoperatively(<italic>P</italic> = 0.004).

Although both convergence and divergenceamplitudes were adversely affected, convergence was affectedto a greater extent in patients with X(T). Convergence recoverypoint was found to be more adversely affected than breakpoint. After surgery, improvement was seen in fusionalvergence amplitudes of patients with X(T) and at six months,no significant difference was present among the two groups.</p><p>We tried to determine the relationship between fusionalvergence amplitudes and stereoacuity. We did not observeany significant correlation between stereoacuity and fusionalvergence amplitudes for distance or near in both X(T) patientsand normal subjects (correlation coefficient varied between-0.104 to 0.227, <italic>P</italic> value 0.2 to 0.9)</p><p>We defined surgical success as postoperative deviation lessthan 8 PD (exo/eso).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Surgical success in motor terms wasachieved in 23 patients (74.2%).

O&#x02032;Neal and associateshave demonstrated that diminished distance stereoacuity isan objective measure of loss of control in X(T) and even withexcellent postoperative alignment, the distance stereoacuity,especially with random dot testing, does not recover fully.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p><p>Findings in our study agree with those of previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> Distance stereoacuity in patients with X(T) was found to be verypoor and surgical realignment led to improvement in distancestereoacuity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> At six months postoperatively mean distancestereoacuity of patients became similar to that of normalsubjects (<italic>P</italic> = 0.2) in our study.</p><p>At present distance stereoacuity is usually evaluated usingMentor B-VAT System and vectographic contour circles test.Though Mentor B-VAT is a very sophisticated instrument,there are certain drawbacks associated with it, in additionto the high cost. Patient has to wear binocular liquid crystalshutter spectacles (connected to a microprocessor) and ispresented with disparate images alternating at high frequency.It is suggested that in patients with X(T) who are having avery tenacious fusional control over their deviation, wearingof shutter spectacles can cause latent deviation to becomemanifest and hence patient will exhibit poor or absent distancestereoacuity on this test.</p><p>In our study, we have used twin polaroid stereoprojectorapparatus with special paired slides for measuring distancestereoacuity. This instrument produces dissociation of two eyesusing the principle of polarization of light. Since both the eyesare open during this test, it appears to be a more physiologicaland less dissociating test available for measuring distancestereoacuity. It is a relatively inexpensive setup which can bedeveloped with two slide projectors, a pair of polaroid filters,a pair of polaroid glasses and a highly polished aluminumscreen. Stereoacuity which we measured ranged from 933 to200 sec of arc.</p><p>One surprising finding of our study was that, even nearstereoacuity was found to be significantly poor in X(T) patientscompared to normal subjects both preoperatively and aftersurgical correction. Surgical realignment led to significantimprovement in near stereoacuity, but even at six monthspostoperatively mean level was still poor compared to that ofnormal subjects. This contrasts with earlier reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> normalnear stereoacuity. One possible explanation for this can be thatpatients report at a later stage of the disease process (criterionfor surgery for this study being frequent manifestationof deviation for distance and/or near). Diminished nearstereoacuity is thus an indicator of more advanced effect ofprolonged X(T) on binocular vision. Hence a more aggressiveapproach in managing these patients is needed and mayyield better functional outcome. Also, this suggests thatnear stereoacuity measurement definitely has got a role inmonitoring the progression of patients with X(T), at least in theabsence of instrument for distance stereoacuity measurement.Near stereoacuity is easily measured on an outpatient basisusing simple equipment (RANDOT, TNO or Titmus), which ischeap and readily available and can be performed very easilyeven in young children. Our study found a good correlationin distance and near stereoacuity levels in normal subjects.Unfortunately, near stereoacuity tends to be affected much laterin the clinical course of patients with X(T) as the manifestationof deviation is more and earlier for distance. Hence relyingonly on near stereoacuity measurement for monitoring sensorystatus of patients with X(T) can lead to undue delay in surgicalintervention.</p><p>This correlation was modest preoperatively in X(T) patientsbut showed improvement at six months postoperatively.This possibly was due to a greater deterioration of distancestereoacuity compared to near stereoacuity seen in X(T), whichis corrected after surgery.</p><p>It was found that successful candidates demonstrated muchbetter preoperative and postoperative stereoacuity levels atnear and distance compared to failed cases and suggests earlyintervention on the basis of deterioration of distance and nearstereoacuity.</p><p>Fusional vergences play a vital role in maintaining normalocular alignment. To the best of our knowledge, no study hasbeen undertaken to measure fusional vergence amplitudesin these patients, though central and peripheral fusion hasbeen evaluated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> We measured fusional vergence amplitudesin normal subjects and X(T) patients using prism bar andaccommodative targets. It was found that X(T) patients hadpoor convergence and divergence amplitudes preoperativelywhen compared with normal subjects. Surgical realignment ledto significant improvement in both convergence and divergenceamplitudes of patients, almost to normal levels. Convergenceamplitude for distance was found to be more adverselyaffected than that for near. This may be an explanation whythese patients manifest their deviation usually first at distancefixation.</p><p>There was good correlation between break points andrecovery points in normal subjects and X(T) patients(postoperative better than preoperative). Also both convergenceand divergence values for distance correlated very well withvalues for near. Thus it seems that performing fusional vergenceamplitude measurements at near fixation alone can providesufficient information for managing these patients.</p><p>We tried to determine the relationship between stereoacuityand fusional vergence amplitudes in X(T) patients and innormal subjects. No correlation was seen between these twoparameters in either of these groups. This indicates that whilefusional vergences have a vital role to play in maintaining motoralignment it appears that they do not have any direct influenceon the sensory status of the eyes.</p><p>To conclude, our study describes a simple test for distancestereoacuity, which is an early indicator of decreasedbinocularity and a useful criterion for the optimal timing ofsurgery in patients with X(T). Short of that, near stereoacuityand near fusion vergences can also be helpful and betteroutcome is expected if the cases are operated before distanceor at least near stereoacuity gets affected. We may suggest thecutoff thresholds for near and distance stereoacuity as 40 arcsec and 400 arc sec respectively, till more studies establish moredefinite norms.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Source of Support: Nil</p></fn><fn><p>Conflict of Interest: None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation
