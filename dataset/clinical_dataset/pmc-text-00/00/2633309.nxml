Currently available corticosteroid and immunomodulation therapies have limited roles in modifying the progression of AR or CAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Therefore, a safe and reliable treatment is urgently needed for these patients. Furthermore, age is the strongest risk factor for the incidence of retinal degeneration in adult Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The prevalence of vision impairments and blindness increases after the age of 40 and is particularly rapid after age 75 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We believe that designing an effective therapy for the treatment of autoimmune retinopathies involves both understanding the disease mechanism and utilizing anti-aging mechanisms in therapeutics.</p><p>CAR and AR are associated with circulating autoantibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The most common autoantibodies found in association with vision loss are against recoverin and &#x003b1;-enolase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In both cases, an increased intracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>+2</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) caused by antibody triggered the apoptotic pathway, and in patients, it can lead to degeneration of photoreceptors in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated the effect of resveratrol, a polyphenolic phytoalexin, on levels of [Ca<sup>+2</sup>]<sub>i </sub>and on protection of retinal cells from antibody-induced apoptotic death <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Resveratrol has strong anti-aging properties and has been shown to play a neuroprotective role in several neurological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] by protecting brain cells from death. Recent studies also directly link the beneficial effects of resveratrol to prevention of vision loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These studies strongly suggest that resveratrol could be useful for treating vision and neurological disorders associated with diverse pathologies. The protective effects of resveratrol on the retinal cells were examined in the <italic>in vitro </italic>study using undifferentiated, immortalized rat retinal E1A.NR3 cells, which express markers specific for photoreceptors, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, and retinal glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The molecular mechanism of resveratrol in cellular protection is not fully understood. Resveratrol acts by inducing the anti-aging protein Sirt1 in organisms ranging from yeasts to mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Sirt1 exhibits anti-apoptotic properties by deacetylating Ku70 protein in HEK293T kidney cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Ku70, a DNA repair protein present in the nucleus in its native deacetylated form, sequesters Bax in the cytoplasm, and thereby performs a protective role in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In our recent study on antibody-induced apoptosis in retinal cells, the upregulated Bax translocated to mitochondria and triggered mitochondria-mediated caspase-3-mediated apoptosis and ultimately caused retinal cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We hypothesize that resveratrol upregulates Sirt1 and Ku70 in retinal cells and suppresses Bax in the cytoplasm, therefore protecting cells from apoptotic death induced by anti-retinal antibody.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>MTT assay</title><p>E1A.NR3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] were grown in a 96-well microplate at a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>/well in 100 &#x003bc;l volume with 0&#x02013;40 &#x003bc;M resveratrol for 16 hrs. 0.8 mg/ml of Rec-1 or Enol-1 were added to the culture for another 72 hrs.

Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> shows marked protective effects of 40 &#x003bc;M resveratrol on the antibody-induced apoptosis in retinal cells. Without resveratrol, Rec-1 significantly reduced cell survival to 45% and Enol-1 reduced the survival to 65% of the DMSO control (p &#x0003c; 0.01). To determine whether resveratrol acts as calcium channel blocker and inhibits [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, we determined free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>in antibody/resveratrol treated cells. Treatment of retinal cells with Rec-1 and Enol-1 caused small, but significant increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>by 8% and 16%, respectively (p &#x0003c; 0.01), compared to normal IgG and untreated control (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). When the cells were pretreated with 40 &#x003bc;M resveratrol for 15 min and then treated with Rec-1 and Enol-1, the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>level stayed at statistically similar to the control levels, suggesting that resveratrol inhibited [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>increases. To test if resveratrol could restore the SERCA function, we used thapsigargin (TPG), a specific inhibitor of SERCA, in the presence and absence of resveratrol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. 2 &#x003bc;M TPG caused a significant increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>in the control, indicating calcium release from intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, 40 &#x003bc;M resveratrol pre-treatment effectively decreased the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>(Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), suggesting that resveratrol may function as a calcium channel blocker in the retinal cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Protection of retinal cells by resveratrol against antibody-induced cytotoxicity</bold>.

Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> shows that in the cytoplasm of resveratrol-treated cells, Bax expression stayed at 1-fold compared to 2.5-fold increase in Rec-1 and 2-fold increase in Enol-1 treatments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

These results suggest that resveratrol may inihibit the overexpression of Bax in both cytoplasm and mitochondria as early as 45 min, and thereby preventing the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. In the next experiment, we determined whether resveratrol affected caspase-3 activation in the retinal cells during apoptosis. Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> shows caspase-3 activities in the cells exposed to 16-hr resveratrol treatment, and then exposed to Enol-1 or Rec-1 for 8, 16 and 24 hrs.

The inhibition of caspase-3 activity was probably due to inactivation of Bax in the cytoplasm by resveratrol in the early steps of the apoptotic events.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Molecular effects of resveratrol on pro-apoptotic proteins in E1A.NR3 retinal cells</bold>.

Our findings demonstrate that by blocking the elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>levels early in the apoptotic pathway, resveratrol reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax in the cytoplasm and mitochondrion. This could be related to the increased expression of Sirt1 and Ku70 in resveratrol-treated cells, suggesting that the upregulation of these proteins interfered with the pro-apoptotic Bax movement to the mitochondria &#x02013; essential steps for mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Our findings support the hypothesis that Sirt1 deacetylates Ku70 and promotes its interaction with Bax in the cytoplasm, thus preventing Bax translocation to mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Based on our results, we propose a mechanism of the resveratrol protection from antibody-induced apoptosis as illustrated in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, which shows that antibodies enter the cell by endocytosis and induce increased intracellular calcium levels, which in turn trigger the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Resveratrol blocks the influx of intracellular calcium and the entry of Bax from the cytoplasm to mitochondria, which subsequently prevents caspase-3 activation and the cell death. If this mechanism of the resveratrol protection is confirmed in animal models of retinopathy, resveratrol could be considered as a therapeutic drug for diseases, in which autoantibodies cause retinal cell death. These findings and future in vivo studies will serve as crucial pre-clinical experiments, upon which, clinical studies can be designed.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>A proposed molecular mechanism of resveratrol protection against antibody-induced apoptosis in retinal cells</bold>. Antibodies enter the cell through endocytosis and induce an increase in intracellular calcium levels, which in turn trigger the mitochondria-mediated increase in caspase 3 activity and apoptotic death of retinal cells. Resveratrol blocked the intracellular calcium level and blocked the entry of Bax from cytoplasm to mitochondria, which subsequently short-circuited the caspase-3 activation and the cell from death.
