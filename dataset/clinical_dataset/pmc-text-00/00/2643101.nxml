The 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines recommend ICS as preferred therapy for patients with mild to severe persistent asthma. Mometasone furoate (MF) is a relatively new ICS agent with high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. It is approved in the US for maintenance treatment of asthma for patients 4 years of age and older. It has been shown to be well tolerated with no significant adverse side effects observed in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. The efficacy of mometasone furoate has been established in large, well-designed studies. In patients with persistent asthma previously treated either with short-acting beta-agonists alone or twice-daily maintenance therapy with ICS, once-daily MF has been shown to be superior to placebo in improving lung function, symptom control, and quality of life; and has shown comparable efficacy compared with budesonide, beclomethasone, and fluticasone. Twice-daily dosing with MF has been demonstrated to successfully allow for reduction or elimination of oral corticosteroids in severe asthmatics.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>inhaled steroids</kwd><kwd>mometasone furoate</kwd><kwd>once-daily dosing</kwd><kwd>asthma</kwd><kwd>stepwise approach</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past two decades, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have been demonstrated to be the most effective treatment for persistent asthma. ICS act on the glucocorticoid receptor to inhibit the release of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, decrease eosinophil and mast cell recruitment, suppress adhesion molecule function and inducible nitric oxide synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-tcrm-4-1201">National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute 2007</xref>). These cellular effects translate clinically into significant improvements in pulmonary function and asthma symptoms as well as reductions in exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, emergency room care, and hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-tcrm-4-1201">National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute 2007</xref>). Further, this class of drugs has been demonstrated to be the most effective class of asthma medications compared with other drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-tcrm-4-1201">National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute 2007</xref>). The most recent National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines recommend ICS as preferred therapy for all severity levels of asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-tcrm-4-1201">National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute 2007</xref>).</p><p>Mometasone furoate (MF) is the first ICS approved for once-daily dosing in the US and was approved for patients 12 years and older in 2005 and for children 4 to 11 years of age in 2008. It is marketed as Asmanex<sup>&#x02122;</sup> with 110 &#x003bc;g and 220 &#x003bc;g per actuation in a multidose dry powder breath-actuated device (Twisthaler<sup>&#x02122;</sup>). The 220 &#x003bc;g form delivers 200 &#x003bc;g of mometasone furoate per actuation while the 110 &#x003bc;g form delivers 100 &#x003bc;g mometasone furoate per actuation. The recommended dosages are 220 &#x003bc;g to 440 &#x003bc;g once daily in the evening (or in 2 divided doses) for patients 12 years and older previously treated with either bronchodilators alone or with ICS. The recommended dose for patients requiring daily treatment with oral corticosteroids is 440 &#x003bc;g twice daily. The only recommended dose for children 4 to 11 years is 110 &#x003bc;g once daily in the evening.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemistry</title><p>MF is a synthetic, 17-heterocyclic conrticosteroid with a very high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. The chemical name of MF is 9&#x003b1;, 21-dichloro-11&#x003b2;,17&#x003b1;-dihydroxy-16&#x003b1;-methyl-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione17-(2&#x02019;)-furoate. Its molecular formula is C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. In vitro studies show that MF binds to a monomeric glucocorticoid receptor at low concentrations and at high concentrations causes dimerization of the glucocorticoid receptor. The receptor affinity of MF has been estimated to be 12 times that of dexamethasone, 7 times that of triamcinolone acetonide, 5 times that of budesonide, and 1.5 times that of fluticasone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-tcrm-4-1201">Crim et al 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacology</title><p>MF is extensively metabolized in the liver by the CYP3A4 enzyme system with only a minor metabolite, 6&#x003b2;-hydroxy-MF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-tcrm-4-1201">Affrime and Kosoglu 2001</xref>). This metabolite is not detectable in plasma after single and multiple doses of MF- (dry powder inhaler) DPI, making it unlikely that it would affect the hydroxylation of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-tcrm-4-1201">Karpel and Nelson 2007</xref>). In vitro studies have demonstrated that there may be as many as 5 metabolites and 4 degradation products of MF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-tcrm-4-1201">Ten et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-tcrm-4-1201">Sahasranaaman et al 2006</xref>). Study doses were mainly excreted in the feces with a small amount in the urine (74 % and 8% respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-tcrm-4-1201">Karpel and Nelson 2007</xref>). Pharmacologic studies of MF in which a single 1000 &#x003bc;g dose of tritiated (3H-) MF was administered by DPI to healthy subjects showed that the plasma concentration were below the limit of quantification (LOQ = 50 pg/mL) in 92% of subjects. These initial data suggested that the bioavailability of inhaled MF is less than 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-4-1201">Affrime et al 2000</xref>). However, other investigations have indicated that the true bioavailability of MF is higher and similar in magnitude to that of other ICS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-tcrm-4-1201">Derendorf et al 2002</xref>).</p><p>In vitro studies have demonstrated that MF has a very high binding affinity for human glucocorticoid receptor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-tcrm-4-1201">Valotis et al (2004)</xref> showed that the relative receptor affinity for MF is 2200 compared with 100 for dexamethasone and 1800 for fluticasone propionate. In that same study, dissociation of the MF-receptor complex was faster than that observed for fluticasone, allowing for faster redistribution of the drug from lung tissue into the plasma. The relative receptor affinity of 6-beta-hydorxy MF has been shown to be significantly lower than the parent compound and is similar in activity to that of flunisolide (206 and 180 for MF and flunisolide, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-tcrm-4-1201">Valotis and H&#x000f6;gger 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical efficacy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-tcrm-4-1201">Table 1</xref>)</title><sec><title>Once-daily dosing in patients only on SABAs</title><p>Two randomized, double blind studies have confirmed the efficacy of once-daily dosing of MF-DPI compared with placebo in steroid-na&#x000ef;ve patients only on SABAs.</p><p>In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-tcrm-4-1201">Bensch et al (2006)</xref>, 196 adult and adolescent asthmatics were randomized to either MF 200 &#x003bc;g once daily in the evening or placebo for 12 weeks. The study demonstrated that MF was well tolerated and showed a significant improvement from baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>- of 0.43 L (16.8%) compared with placebo of 0.16 L (6%) (p &#x0003c; 0.01). There was also significant improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow (FEF) 25% to 75%, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in the treatment group compared with placebo. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the time to worsening of asthma. Other efficacy variables of asthma symptom scores, rescue albuterol use, and nocturnal awakenings were also not significantly different in the two groups. The authors felt that the results showed that a relatively low dose of MF 200 &#x003bc;g was significantly better than placebo in the steroid-na&#x000ef;ve population.</p><p>In a second study of 236 steroid-na&#x000ef;ve adolescent and adult asthmatics by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-tcrm-4-1201">Nayak et al (2000)</xref>, 2 doses given once daily in the morning (200 &#x003bc;g and 400 &#x003bc;g) were compared with placebo assessments. The study results showed that both doses of MF were well-tolerated. For FEV<sub>1</sub>, both the 200 &#x003bc;g and 400 &#x003bc;g once-daily doses showed superior efficacy at 14.8% and 14.2% respectively, compared with placebo (2.5%) but no significant difference between each other. Most of the secondary efficacy variables were significantly improved with both doses compared with placebo. An important finding was that the morning PEF was significantly superior to placebo with the 400 &#x003bc;g dose but not with the 200 &#x003bc;g dose. The authors suggested that 400 &#x003bc;g should be the starting dose with reduction later likely to the 200 &#x003bc;g dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-tcrm-4-1201">Nayak et al 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Once-daily versus twice-daily dosing in patients on SABAs only</title><p>In a 12-week study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-tcrm-4-1201">Kemp et al (2000)</xref> with 306 mild to moderate asthmatic subjects using inhaled SABAs only, MF given once daily (200 &#x003bc;g q AM or 400 &#x003bc;g q AM) or twice daily (200 &#x003bc;g bid) were compared with placebo. There was significant improvement with both the 200 &#x003bc;g bid (16.1%) and 400 &#x003bc;g q AM (16.0%) dosing over placebo (5.5%) in mean change from baseline in FEV<sub>1</sub>. However, the 200 &#x003bc;g q AM (10.4%) dosing did not show a significant difference from placebo. The secondary efficacy variables similarly improved significantly over placebo with a total daily dosing of 400 &#x003bc;g, whether given as a qd or bid dosing. All the doses were well tolerated.</p></sec><sec><title>Once daily versus twice daily dosing in patients previously maintained on ICS</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-tcrm-4-1201">Noonan et al (2001)</xref> randomized 286 mild to moderate asthmatics using twice-daily ICS to receive either MF once daily (200 &#x003bc;g q AM, 200 &#x003bc;g q PM or 400 &#x003bc;g q AM) or twice daily (200 &#x003bc;g bid) or placebo for 12 weeks. This was preceded by a 2-week open-label phase where all subjects received MF 200 &#x003bc;g bid. To obtain data on possible HPA axis suppression, cosyntropin stimulation tests were done on 20 to 24 subjects in each treatment group. Results showed that all doses were well tolerated. There was an expected increase in the mean baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> (2.52 to 2.65 L) after the open-label run-in period on MF 200 &#x003bc;g bid. This increase was maintained with the 400 &#x003bc;g qd (&#x02212;0.01), 200 &#x003bc;g bid (&#x02212;0.03), and 200 &#x003bc;g q PM (0.03) doses compared with placebo (&#x02212;0.30). However, the 200 &#x003bc;g q AM dose (&#x02212;0.22) did not do better than placebo, suggesting that evening dosing might be more effective. The 400 &#x003bc;g qd dose provided the most consistent improvement in the secondary efficacy variables. The cosyntropin stimulation test results demonstrated that a similar proportion of subjects had normal responses in the treatment and placebo groups. This study was one of the first to show that once-daily dosing could maintain effective control in patients previously on twice-daily dosing.</p><p>In a 12-week study with 400 subjects by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-tcrm-4-1201">D&#x02019;Urzo et al (2005)</xref>, the primary objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of once-daily MF-DPI 400 &#x003bc;g q PM with placebo. A secondary objective was to compare several MF dosing regimens with each other and placebo. Subjects were all previously on stable bid ICS for at least 30 days and were randomized to one of 4 dosing regimens of MF: 200 &#x003bc;g q PM; 2 inhalations of 200 &#x003bc;g q PM; 200 &#x003bc;g bid; or placebo. All the MF doses showed significant improvement over placebo with mean changes from baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> of 0.41L (400 &#x003bc;g q PM), 0.49 L (200 &#x003bc;g 2 inhalations q PM), 0.41L (200 &#x003bc;g q PM), 0.51 L (200 &#x003bc;g bid), and 0.16 L (placebo) (p &#x0003c; 0.001). All of the treatment doses were well tolerated and improved secondary efficacy variables. This study confirmed the efficacy of the 400 &#x003bc;g evening dose, whether given as one 400 &#x003bc;g inhalation or two 200 &#x003bc;g inhalations. The lowest dose of 200 &#x003bc;g q PM also appeared to be similarly effective.</p><p>Similar results were obtained in a study of 268 subjects by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-tcrm-4-1201">Karpel et al (2005)</xref>. Patients were 12 years of age or older and previously on stable ICS bid for at least 30 days with FEV<sub>1</sub> between 50% to 85% of predicted. The treatments in the study included MF 400 &#x003bc;g q PM, MF 200 &#x003bc;g bid and placebo. Both MF doses were well tolerated with mean change from baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> significantly improved over placebo. The once daily MF 400 &#x003bc;g was as effective as twice daily MF 200 &#x003bc;g bid in improving the primary secondary efficacy measures.</p></sec><sec><title>MF in children</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-tcrm-4-1201">Berger et al (2006)</xref> published the results of a study of MF-DPI in 296 asthmatic children. Children were enrolled of 4 to 11 years of age with mild to moderate asthma, an FEV<sub>1</sub> of 60% to 85% of predicted, and on stable ICS doses for at least 60 days. The subjects were randomized to receive either 100 &#x003bc;g once daily in the evening, 100 &#x003bc;g bid, or placebo. The authors indicated that the inclusion of a placebo was justified because patients who worsened were to be discontinued and use of short-acting beta-agonists was allowed. Both treatment groups showed significant improvement of FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline compared with placebo (p &#x02264; 0.002). The least squares mean changes in the percentage of predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> were 4.73 (MF qd) and 5.52 (MF bid) compared with &#x02013;1.77 (placebo). There was no significant difference in effectiveness between the two doses (p = 0.70). FVC, FEF 25% to 75%, and PEF were superior for both doses compared with placebo but with no significant difference between the doses. The other secondary variables, including asthma symptom scores, rescue medication use, and HR QoL assessments all showed that the MF groups were similar to each other but superior to placebo. Fewer than 50% in the MF treatment groups had worsening of asthma so the median time to worsening could not be determined. Overall, this study showed the efficacy and safety of the MF-DPI 100 &#x003bc;g once daily evening dosing in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduction of oral steroids in severe asthma</title><p>The use of chronic oral corticosteroids (OCS) is necessary in a small population of patients with severe asthma.

The subjects were 12 years of age or older who had required daily or alternate-day OCS for asthma control for 5 or more of the 6 months before enrollment with FEV<sub>1</sub> 40% to 85% of predicted. The minimum effective prednisone dose was determined for each subject either by previous documentation in the previous 6 months or before screening by the investigator who reduced the dose in a stepwise manner until pulmonary function declined. Subjects receiving a minimum effective prednisone dose of 5 to 30 mg daily or 10 to 60 mg every other day were eligible for the study. After a 2-week run-in period with the subjects continuing their usual ICS and minimum effective prednisone dose, they were randomized to either MF-DPI 400 &#x003bc;g bid, MF 800 &#x003bc;g bid, or placebo and their pre-study ICS was stopped. The primary outcome measure was the percentage change from baseline in daily prednisone requirement. A significantly larger proportion of subjects on placebo (55%) compared with those on MF 400 &#x003bc;g bid (7%) and MF 800 &#x003bc;g bid (12%) discontinued due to treatment failure and worsened asthma. The primary outcome measure showed that the MF 400 &#x003bc;g bid (&#x02212;46%) and MF 800 &#x003bc;g bid (&#x02212;23.9 %) decreased prednisone use very significantly compared with placebo (+164.4%) (p &#x0003c; 0.01). Sixty-two percent of those on MF 400 &#x003bc;g bid and 62% of those on 800 &#x003bc;g bid reduced prednisone dose by 50% compared with 7 % of the placebo group. Complete elimination of prednisone use was seen in 40% of the MF 400 &#x003bc;g bid group and 37% of the MF 800 &#x003bc;g bid group, compared with 0% in the placebo group. Indices of pulmonary function, symptom scores, and QoL measures were also improved significantly in the MF treatment groups compared with placebo. The increase in prednisone use in the placebo group was expected because the subjects&#x02019; usual ICS were stopped prior to randomization. The authors noted that this observation supported the presence of true OCS-dependent asthma in this group. Both MF doses were well-tolerated with comparable results between the two MF doses leading the authors to conclude that the MF 400 &#x003bc;g bid dose is a safe and effective alternative to OCS in severe asthma. The steroid-sparing benefits of MF were maintained in a 9-month open label extension phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-tcrm-4-1201">Schmier et al 2003</xref>).</p><p>Using similar methods and outcome measures, a more recent trial studied MF (delivered in the hydrofluoroalkane [HFA]-227 metered dose inhaler [MDI] device) in 123 OCS-dependent severe persistent asthmatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-tcrm-4-1201">Karpel et al 2007</xref>).

The authors noted that the DPI produces high dose uniformity because it does not require hand/breath coordination and that this may contribute to better results with the DPI compared with the MDI.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with fluticasone proprionate (FP)</title><p>A large active-controlled study conducted in 20 countries by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-tcrm-4-1201">O&#x02019;Connor et al (2001)</xref>, with 732 subjects, compared the efficacy and safety of MF-DPI with the FP Diskhaler<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 250 &#x003bc;g bid as the active control. Subjects were already on stable ICS doses for at least 30 days and had baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> at 60% to 90% of predicted. Subjects received either one of three doses of MF-DPI (100 &#x003bc;g, 200 &#x003bc;g, or 400 &#x003bc;g bid) or FP Diskhaler 250 &#x003bc;g bid. All MF doses and FP improved FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline with a total daily dose of MF 200 &#x003bc;g bid dose (0.16 L) comparable with FP 500 &#x003bc;g per day (0.16 L). MF 100 &#x003bc;g bid was the least effective (0.07 L) while MF 400 &#x003bc;g bid (0.19 L) offered no additional benefit. Greater improvement was also seen in the secondary variables for the MF 200 &#x003bc;g and 400 &#x003bc;g bid and FP groups compared with the MF 100 &#x003bc;g bid group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-tcrm-4-1201">O&#x02019;Connor et al 2001</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-tcrm-4-1201">Wardlaw et al (2004)</xref> conducted an open-label 8 week study of 167 subjects with moderate persistent asthma on previously stable FP for at least 30 days. Subjects were required to have an FEV<sub>1</sub> of 60% to 90% of predicted and were randomized to receive either MF-DPI 400 &#x003bc;g q PM or FP MDI 250 &#x003bc;g (two 125 &#x003bc;g inhalations) bid. Mean changes from baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> for the MF-DPI and FP groups were 0.11 L (4.58%) and 0.16 L (6.98%), respectively (p = 0.35). Both drugs were well tolerated, with significantly more subjects who &#x0201c;liked the inhaler a lot&#x0201d; in MF-DPI group (46.8%) than in the FP group (22.4%) (p = 0.01). This open label study confirmed comparable efficacy between a total daily dose on MF 400 &#x003bc;g q PM and FP 500 &#x003bc;g qd.</p><p>The most recent comparison between these two inhaled compounds was published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-tcrm-4-1201">Harnest et al (2008)</xref>. In this 12-week non-inferiority trial of patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, there were no significant between-group differences in lung function, rescue medication use, response to therapy, exacerbation rates, or adverse events between MF-DPI 400 &#x003bc;g twice daily or FP-DPI 500 &#x003bc;g twice daily. Based on these results, these medications appear to be roughly equivalent in effectiveness on a microgram basis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Safety and tolerability</title><p>In general, the potential for side effects from ICS is small and the benefits far outweigh any risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-tcrm-4-1201">National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute 2007</xref>). However, local and occasionally systemic side effects may occur with ICS, especially at high doses. Oral candidiasis can be seen and mouth-rinsing after each inhalation should always be strongly advised for patients. Systemic effects such as adrenal suppression, cataracts, glaucoma, and decreased bone mineral density in adults, and adrenal suppression and decreased growth velocity in children are possible with high doses of inhaled steroids but are much less likely than with oral or parenteral steroids.</p><p>In clinical studies in both children and adults, MF has been shown to be well tolerated; oral candidiasis was the most frequently observed treatment-related adverse event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-tcrm-4-1201">Meltzer et al 2006</xref>). Studies of HPA axis suppression have revealed only minimal effects by MF. In one study comparing the HPA axis effects of MF and FP, the free plasma concentration producing 50% urinary cortisol suppression (IC<sub>50</sub>) was similar for both compounds indicating the same potential to cause systemic side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-tcrm-4-1201">Tayab et al 2007</xref>). Adrenal suppression as measured by overnight urinary cortisol/creatinine in a study with 21 patients also suggested similar significant suppression by both MF and FP dry powder formulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-tcrm-4-1201">Fardon et al 2004</xref>). In a study of MF delivered by DPI or MDI, doses of up to1600 &#x003bc;g daily for 28 days showed minimal HPA axis suppression as measured by serum cortisol concentration area under the curve over 24 hours (AUC 24) and consyntropin response test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-tcrm-4-1201">Affrime et al 2000</xref>). In a study comparing MF-DPI 400 &#x003bc;g qd with beclomethasone diproprionate (BDP) HFA 200 &#x003bc;g 2 puffs bid and BDP-CFC 400 &#x003bc;g 2 puffs bid for 14 days, the serum cortisol AUC24 decreased to a lesser degree with MF than with the two formulations of BDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-tcrm-4-1201">Chrousos et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>Studies of MF effects on bone mineral density (BMD) have been conducted for periods up to 2 years in duration. At the 2-year endpoint, there was no statistically significant in lumbar spine BMD in patients using 400 &#x003bc;g bid compared with a placebo group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-tcrm-4-1201">Mortimer et al 2005</xref>).</p><p>Decreases in growth velocity may be observed in children taking with ICS but long-term follow-up studies have shown that the expected adult heights are usually achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-tcrm-4-1201">Agertoft and Pedersen 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-tcrm-4-1201">Gulliver et al 2007</xref>). The effect of MF on growth in children has been followed for up to 1 year in clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-tcrm-4-1201">Skoner et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-tcrm-4-1201">Lemanske et al 2004</xref>). In a 1-year study, there was no difference in growth velocity between patients taking MF-DPI 100 &#x003bc;g qd (6.42 cm/year) and placebo (6.52 cm/year), but a slight but statistically significant difference was observed with patients taking 200 &#x003bc;g qd (5.82 cm/year).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MF is a potent ICS with strong affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. It is currently approved for use in 40 countries including the UK and EU down to the age of 4 years. It is well tolerated with no significant adverse side effects seen in post-marketing surveillance different from those known for ICS as a class. The efficacy of MF has been established in large, well-designed studies. Once-daily dosing has been shown to be as effective as twice daily dosing. In patients with persistent asthma on SABA alone, or on previous ICS taken twice-daily, MF has been shown to be superior to placebo in improving lung function, symptom control and quality of life. It has also allowed severe asthmatics to reduce or eliminate OCS from their regimen. MF-DPI once-daily has shown comparable or better efficacy with BDP, BUD, and FP.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>JC has served as a consultant and advisory board member for, and has received research grants from, Schering Plough, the maker of Asmanex.
