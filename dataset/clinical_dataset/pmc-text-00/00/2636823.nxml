Adipose tissue samples were taken from the abdomen and buttock during the endoscopy procedure and samples from gastric tissue were taken from a subsample of 30 subjects.

The pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease has centered on an imbalance between aggressive and protective factors in the stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Twenty five years have elapsed since Marshall and Warren's discovery of the link between <italic>Helicobacter pylori </italic>(<italic>H. pylori</italic>) infection and peptic ulcer disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The clinical outcome of <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection is most likely the result of complex interactions between bacterial, environmental, and host-related factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The prevalence of <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection varies, has been decreasing in the last few decades in most developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Epidemiological evidence suggests that the declining prevalence of peptic ulcer disease may be partially attributable to increased consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), a hypothesis supported by in vitro evidence of toxicity of such substances to <italic>H. pylori </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>It has therefore been suggested that dietary fat plays a protective role against peptic ulcer disease. The fatty acids (FAs) present in adipose tissue include certain fatty acids that cannot be endogenously synthesized and are, consequently, considered valid biomarkers of the dietary intake of these FAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Since adipose tissue has a slow turnover, it is an attractive choice for the study of long-term dietary fatty acid intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Fatty acids that cannot be synthesized endogenously from carbohydrates and which are considered valid biomarkers of dietary fatty acid intake are: <italic>n</italic>-3 PUFAs, such as linoleic acid (C18:2<italic>n</italic>-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (C20:5<italic>n</italic>-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6<italic>n</italic>-3), <italic>n</italic>-6 PUFAs, such as &#x003b1;-linoleic acid (18:3<italic>n</italic>-3), <italic>trans </italic>FAs and odd-numbered and branched-chain FAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) and saturated FAs (SFAs) do not reflect dietary intake patterns, with the exception of odd-numbered SFAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>It is possible that some PUFAs, especially those of the <italic>n</italic>-3 group, are able to modulate the immune responses to <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Many studies report the effects of ingested FAs on molecular and cellular aspects of immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. SFAs are able to induce the activation of TLR2 and TLR4, whereas unsaturated FAs, such as <italic>n</italic>-3, inhibit TLR-mediated signaling pathways and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, any diet-induced variation in fatty acid composition of fat depots may influence directly the membrane organization of immune cells and result in impaired functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In particular, dietary <italic>n</italic>-3 PUFAs alter T cell membrane microdomain composition and may therefore influence signaling complexes and modulate T cell activation in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Prostaglandins (PGs) play an important role in maintaining the gastro duodenal mucosal integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. PGs stimulate mucosal bicarbonate secretion, accelerate cell proliferation, enhance mucus secretion and mucosal blood flow, increase mucosal sulfhydryl groups and promote both lysosomal stability and the formation of mucosal phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Dietary linoleic acid (C18:2<italic>n</italic>-6) is converted to arachidonic acid (C20:4<italic>n</italic>-6) which is the main unsaturated 20-carbon fatty acid used for the production of PGs via the cyclooxygenase pathway. Thus, an increased intake of linoleic acid might lead to an enhanced production of endogenous PGs.</p><p>The phospholipids of the gastric mucosa provide a hydrophobic lining that protects against extrinsic and intrinsic insults. The saturation level and the chain length of the FAs incorporated into these phospholipids influence both the membrane hydrophobicity and permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Although some studies have examined the gastric mucosa in relation to <italic>H. pylori</italic>, little is known about the fatty acid composition of the gastric mucosa in relation to gastric ulceration. The aim of the present study is to compare the fatty acid composition of adipose tissue and gastric mucosa in subjects with gastric ulceration and subjects without evidence of ulceration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The study was conducted between June 2000 and November 2004 at the Gastroenterology Outpatient clinic of the University Hospital of Crete. Eligible patients were those with present or past abdominal complaints, who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy screening. Patients were excluded if they were known to have concurrent illness, were on any medication or had taken H2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, bismuth, antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids within 2 months of the examination. Fifty-two patients, all residents of the island of Crete, participated in the study. Patient ages ranged from 21 to 89 years (mean age 60, SD 16.9, median 64 years). The percentage of female subjects was similar in patients with and without gastric ulceration, being 9 out of 16 (56%) and 21 out of 36 (58%) respectively. All patients gave informed consent before the endoscopy, the endoscopic biopsy and the collection of adipose tissue samples. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical School of the University of Crete.</p><p>The collection of the abdominal and buttock subcutaneous tissue samples as well as that of the gastric tissue was performed at the Department of Gastroenterology of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete.</p><p>All patients provided buttock subcutaneous tissue samples and 42 provided abdominal subcutaneous tissue samples.

The histological results matched the results from the CLO test in all cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Adipose tissue measures</title><p>Both abdominal and buttock subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were collected since there are reported differences in fatty acid content among abdominal and buttock depots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Abdominal and buttock tissue samples were collected by aspiration, using the method described by Beynen and Katan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The particular method is known to be rapid and safe, causing no more discomfort than a routine venipuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Abdominal and buttock adipose tissue samples can be safely stored for up to 1.5 year without changes in the FA component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Abdominal adipose tissue samples were taken from the left upper quadrant of the abdominal area, and in close proximity to the umbilicus. Buttock adipose tissue samples were taken from the left upper outer quadrant of the gluteal area. Both abdominal and buttock adipose tissue samples were taken through the use of 10 ml vacutainer tubes. Prior to aspiration, aspiration sites were sprayed with local anaesthetic (ethyl chloride).</p><p>Adipose tissue samples were stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Prior to analysis, the samples were thawed and the fat was transferred to 10 ml screw-capped tubes using Pasteur pipettes and several drops (~0.5 ml) of chloroform: methanol (2:1, v/v). Methyl esters of the fat component FAs (FAME) were prepared in the screw-capped vials according to the method described by Metcalfe et al (1966) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Briefly, 20&#x02013;30 mg of fat sample were saponified with 1.0 ml NaOH in methanol and the FAME were prepared with 14% boron trifluoride in methanol following extraction with hexane after washing with saturated NaCl.

The hexane (upper layer) containing the FAME was transferred to GC vials and stored at -20&#x000b0;C until analysis. The FAME of the gastric tissue were released from both triacyglycerols and phospholipids since the total quantity of the gastric tissue collected from each patient was relatively small.

Details are provided in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, no notable differences in adipose fatty acid composition were found between subjects with and without gastric ulceration. These findings are in agreement with those of a study that examined the possible preventative role of linoleic (C18:2<italic>n</italic>-6) fatty acid in gastric ulceration. The authors came to the conclusion that there was no significant difference in the adipose tissue content of linoleic acid between patients with gastric ulcer disease and matched control subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our findings are, however, in contrast to the results of Grant et al (1990) and Prichard et al (1988) who presented a possible preventing role of dietary intake of linoleic fat acid and olive oil in gastric ulceration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>In our study, ulcer-negative subjects were found to differ in adipose tissue fatty acid composition according to CLO status, there being higher levels of C20:4<italic>n</italic>-6, C20:3<italic>n</italic>-3, C20:5<italic>n</italic>-3 (EPA), C22:4, C22:5<italic>n</italic>-3 and C22:6<italic>n</italic>-3 (DHA) in abdominal samples and C16:1<italic>n</italic>-7<italic>cis</italic>, C20:3<italic>n</italic>-6, C20:4<italic>n</italic>-6, C22:5<italic>n</italic>-3 and C22:6<italic>n</italic>-3 in buttock samples in CLO negative patients.</p><p>It is possible that the consumption of PUFAs inhibits the growth of <italic>H. pylori </italic>and the colonization of the gastric mucosa, a hypothesis that is in agreement with previous studies showing that ingested dietary PUFAs inhibit the growth of <italic>H. pylori </italic>in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These studies suggest that the inhibitory effect of PUFAs to <italic>H. pylori </italic>is due: (a) to the disruption of the bacterial outer lipid membrane which leads to cell lysis and (b) to the polyunsaturated induced increased permeability of the bacterial cell membranes which leads to dissipated concentration gradients between the organism and its environment, such as those for hydrogen ions with fatal outcomes for <italic>H. pylori </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>It is also possible that the higher levels of some PUFAs, especially those of the <italic>n</italic>-3 group, in CLO negative patients reflect the role of FAs to the modulation of immune responses to <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Adipose tissue functions are, in fact, crucial in protective immunity against noxious agents such as <italic>H pylori</italic>. Mueller et al (2003) have concluded that a number of genes specifically expressed in fat cells/adipocytes, tightly correlate with protection from <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Among these are genes for three adipocyte-specific cytokines, the so-called "adipokines," adipsin, resistin, and adiponectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It has also been suggested that the secreted adipokines are likely mediators of crosstalk with lymphocytes. This paracrine relationship between adipose and lymphoid tissues possibly explains the link between the production and secretion of adipokines and a protective response against <italic>H. pylori </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is possible that secreted adipocyte factors stimulate the effector functions of resident T cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This hypothesis is supported by numerous studies demonstrating an essential role of CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells in the protection against <italic>H. pylori </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Findings from dietary intervention studies lead, however, to conclusion that PUFAs, when orally ingested as dietary supplements, do not inhibit either the colonization of the mucosa by <italic>H. pylori </italic>or the inflammatory changes characteristic of <italic>H. pylori </italic>gastritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It may be that the absorption and distribution of PUFAs derived from capsules differ from those naturally present in the diet. Further research could investigate whether the long term supply of digested PUFA foods, as estimated by the adipose tissue fatty acid composition, is of greater effectiveness against <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection than the short term per os supply of high doses of PUFA.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first literature report of a possible association between fatty acid composition of the gastric mucosa and the presence of gastric ulceration. It was found that the MUFAs C18:1<italic>n</italic>-12c, C16:1<italic>n</italic>-5 and C16:4<italic>n</italic>-1 and the PUFAs C16:3<italic>n</italic>-4, C20:3<italic>n</italic>-3, C20:4<italic>n</italic>-6, C21:5<italic>n</italic>-3, C22:4<italic>n</italic>-3 and C18:2<italic>n</italic>-9c,12t were present at somewhat higher levels in the gastric mucosa of ulcer-negative patients, leading to the hypothesis that some PUFAs may possibly play a possible preventive role in gastric ulceration. Additionally, there were significantly higher proportions of C13:0, C15:0, C14:1<italic>n</italic>-9c and C20:1 in the gastric mucosa of patients with gastric ulcer disease, also indicating a possible protective role for some FAs versus others in gastric ulceration.</p><p>Arachidonic acid (C20:4<italic>n</italic>-6) is incorporated in membrane phospholipids. Surface active phospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholine, play an important role in the first line of defense of the stomach, most likely because of their hydrophobic properties. Both membrane hydrophobicity and permeability are known to be influenced by the saturation level and chain length of FAs that composes the surface active phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In addition, arachidonic acid is a precursor fatty acid in the prostaglandin synthesis pathway. PGs of the E, A and I series have been shown to suppress basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion in rats and normal human subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that PGs of the E type are capable of preventive formation of gastric ulcers in rats induced by a wide variety of experimental techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Tarnawski et al (1987) also showed a significant cytoprotective effect of oral administration of linoleic acid on ethanol-induced gastric injury, an effect significantly reduced by pre-treatment with oral indomethacin, a known inhibitor of prostaglandin synthetase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Both the design of our study and the results themselves, however, cannot lead to the conclusion of a definitive relation between fatty acid composition and gastric ulceration status. In addition, it is known that when multiple comparisons are undertaken, there is an effective increase in the significance level. Adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction (adjusted alpha = 0.001), results in only C14:1<italic>n</italic>-9 c, C20:1, C16:2<italic>n</italic>-4 and C21:5<italic>n</italic>-3 remaining statistically significant at the unadjusted 5% level (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). None of these fatty acids contributed more than 1% on average to the total fatty acid content. The biological relevance of the statistically significant results is not clear. The role that CLO status may play in the relation between fatty acid composition and the presence of gastric ulceration could not be investigated (or accounted for in the statistical analysis) as 18 of the 19 subjects without a gastric ulcer from whom a gastric mucosal sample was taken, were CLO negative. Since it is known that <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection alters not only the gastric mucosal phosphatidylcholine content, but also its fatty acid composition, which may consequently cause the gastric mucosal barrier to weaken, further investigation is needed in order to clarify the relation of the fatty acid composition of the gastric mucosa to <italic>H. pylori </italic>colonization.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Certain MUFAs and PUFAs of the gastric mucosa appear to be present in somewhat higher proportions in ulcer negative patients. These findings seem to suggest a possible protective role of the gastric mucosa FAs in gastric ulceration, although statistically significant differences were found only in certain minor FAs i.e. FAs contributing only a very small fraction of the total fatty acid contents. The higher average levels of EPA and DHA in abdominal and buttock adipose tissue in CLO negative, ulcer negative patients, may also suggest that dietary FAs could inhibit <italic>H. pylori </italic>growth. Further studies are required to ascertain whether such FAs do, in fact, play a role in the prevention of gastric ulceration.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p><italic>H. pylori</italic>: <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>; CLO: Campylobacter-Like Organism test (rapid urease test for <italic>H. pylori </italic>infection); EPA: eicosapentaenoic acid; DHA: docosahexaenoic acid; HLA: human leukocyte antigen; FAs: fatty acids; PGs: prostaglandins; PUFA: polyunsaturated fatty acids; MUFA: monounsaturated fatty acids; SFA: saturated fatty acids; GS: gas chromatography; FAME: fatty acid methyl esters; FID: Flame ionization detector; TLR: Toll-like receptors; APC: Antigen-presenting cell.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VAP collected the adipose tissue samples, participated in the design and coordination of the study and wrote the manuscript.
