It has been proposed that tension generated by the stretch of the centromeric chromatin of bioriented chromosomes stabilizes kinetochore microtubule attachments and turns off SAC activity. Although biorientation clearly causes stretching of the centromeric chromatin, it is unclear whether the kinetochore is also stretched. To test whether intrakinetochore stretch occurs and is involved in SAC regulation, we developed a <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> S2 cell line expressing centromere identifier&#x02013;mCherry and Ndc80&#x02013;green fluorescent protein to mark the inner and outer kinetochore domains, respectively. We observed stretching within kinetochores of bioriented chromosomes by monitoring both inter- and intrakinetochore distances in live cell assays. This intrakinetochore stretch is largely independent of a 30-fold variation in centromere stretch. Furthermore, loss of intrakinetochore stretch is associated with enhancement of 3F3/2 phosphorylation and SAC activation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Equal partitioning of the replicated genome by the mitotic spindle is essential to avoiding aneuploidy. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) improves the likelihood that each daughter cell receives a normal complement of chromosomes by ensuring that anaphase onset does not occur until every chromosome becomes bioriented at the spindle equator. The kinetochore, which is the structure on each sister chromatid where microtubules attach to the chromosome, is the site at which the localization and activities of SAC components are integrated into a &#x0201c;wait anaphase&#x0201d; signal when necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). Chromosome biorientation stretches the chromatin between kinetochores attached to microtubules emanating from opposite poles. Although it remains unclear whether tension signals directly to the SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">McIntosh, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pinsky and Biggins, 2005</xref>), there is strong evidence that the generation of tension is a prerequisite for anaphase onset in normal mitoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Li and Nicklas, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biggins and Murray, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stern and Murray, 2001</xref>). The traditional readout for tension is changes in interkinetochore distance, which is the distance between two sister centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Waters et al., 1996</xref>). However, it is not clear whether chromosome biorientation also causes stretching of the core kinetochore structure and, if so, whether this physical change is detected by the SAC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To investigate the physical changes that occur within the kinetochore structure itself, we generated a <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> S2 cell line, which we have deemed K-Tensor (kinetochore tensometer and orientation) cells, that expresses both centromere identifier (CID)&#x02013;mCherry and Ndc80-GFP (C-terminal label) to mark the inner and outer layers of the kinetochore, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The existence of movable elements within the kinetochore was first indicated by the fact that the distance between the inner and outer labels of the kinetochore changes between prophase and metaphase kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Live imaging of K-Tensor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> and Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808130/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808130/DC1</ext-link>) allowed us to monitor interkinetochore distance by measuring the distance between the peak CID intensities of a sister kinetochore pair and intrakinetochore distance (delta). Delta was calculated by measuring the difference in distance between the Ndc80 and CID signals for a pair of sister kinetochores divided by two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wordeman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schittenhelm et al., 2007</xref>).

Spindle microtubules in mitotic S2 cells completely depolymerized within 1 h after the addition of 25 &#x000b5;M colchicine to the media (Video 3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808130/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808130/DC1</ext-link>). Most S2 cells are capable of arresting in mitosis for at least 4&#x02013;5 h in the presence of colchicine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The interkinetochore distance was 720 &#x000b1; 110 nm and delta was 65 &#x000b1; 31 nm for colchicine-treated cells. These values define the rest lengths for both interkinetochore distance and delta in the absence of attached kinetochore microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). In comparison, spindles in control K-Tensor cells progressed through mitosis (defined as the time from the onset of chromosome condensation and anaphase) in 51 &#x000b1; 19 min (Video 2). The interkinetochore distance for control cells at metaphase was 940 &#x000b1; 130 nm, whereas delta was 102 &#x000b1; 27 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B&#x02013;E</xref>). The mean centromere stretch, or increase in distance over rest length, was 220 nm between chromosomes with unattached kinetochore microtubules (colchicine treated) and bioriented chromosomes (control metaphase). The mean intrakinetochore stretch in control cells was 37 nm above the rest length distance of 65 nm in colchicine-treated cells.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Microtubule poisons differentially affect interkinetochore distance and delta.</bold> (A) Selected frames from time-lapse imaging of GFP-tubulin&#x02013;expressing S2 cells after treatment with DMSO, 25 &#x000b5;M colchicine, or 20 nM taxol.

Spindle microtubules completely depolymerize within 1 h after the addition of 25 &#x000b5;M colchicine, which causes cells to delay in mitosis for at least 4 h (<italic>n</italic> = 40 cells).

In S2 cells, spindles assembled with aligned and bioriented chromosomes in the presence of 20 nM taxol (Video 4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808130/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808130/DC1</ext-link>). Surprisingly, these cells exhibited the same kinetics of mitotic progression (51 &#x000b1; 19 min) as control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Thus, the SAC is satisfied in S2 cells in the presence of low doses of taxol. In the presence of 20 nM taxol, the mean interkinetochore distance was reduced to 740 &#x000b1; 120 nm, which represents only 9% of control centromere stretch. Addition of 20 nM taxol slightly reduced delta compared with DMSO-treated cells to a mean value of 97 &#x000b1; 27 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D&#x02013;G</xref>). The distribution of values for interkinetochore distance after taxol treatment was similar to the distribution for colchicine-treated cells, whereas the distribution of delta values for 20 nM taxol was very similar to control measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D&#x02013;F</xref>). These data indicate that the intra- and interkinetochore elements are not linear Hookean springs connected in series but rather exist as a more complex mechanical arrangement.</p><p>In many vertebrate cell types, addition of higher doses of taxol stabilizes microtubule dynamics and preserves kinetochore microtubules while inducing a near complete reduction of centromere stretch and activating the SAC. Addition of &#x0003e;20&#x02013;50 nM taxol to S2 cells caused cells to arrest in mitosis for 153 &#x000b1; 52 min with monopolar spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref> and Video 5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808130/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808130/DC1</ext-link>). These structures were not amenable to investigating delta because they lacked bioriented chromosomes. Time-lapse imaging of taxol-induced bipolar spindle collapse led us to hypothesize that this process required minus end&#x02013;directed motor activity (Video 6). Indeed, we found that the percentage of taxol monopoles significantly decreased after RNAi of two different minus end&#x02013;directed motors: dynein heavy chain (DHC) or nonclaret disjunction (Ncd; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). The data indicate that DHC and Ncd share functional redundancy in the bipolar spindle collapse mechanism, albeit Ncd is the dominant minus end&#x02013;directed motor activity involved in this process. DHC RNAi taxol bipoles maintained focused poles, whereas Ncd RNAi structures had unfocused kinetochore fibers. The Ncd RNAi structures that were classified as bipolar consisted of bioriented chromosomes largely aligned between unfocused kinetochore fiber arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Treatment with 1 &#x000b5;M taxol reduces delta and activates the SAC.</bold> (A) Selected frames from time-lapse imaging of a preformed taxol monopole (top) and an MG132-treated bipolar spindle collapsing into a monopole after the addition of 1 &#x000b5;M taxol (bottom).

(C and D) Treatment of Ncd RNAi structures with 1 &#x000b5;M taxol (<italic>n</italic> = 240 kinetochore pairs) causes a reduction in both the interkinetochore distance and delta relative to Ncd RNAi alone (<italic>n</italic> = 95 kinetochore pairs).

RNAi of DHC or Ncd alone had minor effects on metaphase interkinetochore distance and delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>; and Fig. S2). In contrast, addition of 1 &#x000b5;M taxol to Ncd and DHC RNAi cells reduced both interkinetochore distance and delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>; and Fig. S2). Note that for both DHC RNAi and Ncd RNAi, taxol treatment reduced delta without reducing interkinetochore distance below the 20-nM taxol level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D and F</xref>). This is further evidence that the mechanical linkages between centromeric DNA and structures within sister kinetochores are not a simple arrangement of linear Hookean springs.</p><p>In the absence of taxol, DHC RNAi induces a mitotic delay (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808130/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808130/DC1</ext-link>) because Mad2 is retained at attached kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Griffis et al., 2007</xref>); however, Ncd RNAi does not cause an increase in the mitotic index or slow mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>). Importantly, addition of 1 &#x000b5;M taxol delayed Ncd RNAi cells in mitosis for 150 &#x000b1; 47 min, indicating that the SAC was active. Thus, suppression of microtubule dynamics in Ncd RNAi cells with 1 &#x000b5;M taxol reduced delta and activated the SAC without clearly disrupting microtubule attachment.</p><p>To further understand how interkinetochore distance and delta are related, we used molecular perturbations to alter interkinetochore distances and assayed how delta was affected. The Rod&#x02013;ZW10&#x02013;Zwilch complex member ZW10 is a bona fide SAC regulator that is required to target dynein and Mad1/Mad2 to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Starr et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buffin et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, ZW10 has been implicated in regulating centromere stretch, kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule attachment stability, and tension sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Famulski and Chan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). In agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kops et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Famulski et al., 2008</xref>), ZW10 RNAi in S2 cells led to loss of SAC activity, as the mitotic index of ZW10 RNAi cells treated for 18 h with colchicine was fourfold lower than control cells (unpublished data). Furthermore, ZW10 knockdown caused cells to progress through mitosis faster than control cells (36 &#x000b1; 13 min vs. 51 &#x000b1; 17 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref> and Video 7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808130/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200808130/DC1</ext-link>). We found that the mean interkinetochore distance was reduced from 940 &#x000b1; 130 nm in controls to 860 &#x000b1; 130 nm after ZW10 RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). This represents an &#x0223c;40% reduction in centromere stretch as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). ZW10 RNAi yielded a broad distribution of delta distances with a mean delta of 87 &#x000b1; 30 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Because ZW10 targets a population of dynein to the kinetochore, we hypothesized that dynein could be responsible for generating delta. However, DHC RNAi produced a smaller reduction in delta than ZW10 RNAi and did not reduce the mean interkinetochore distance (Fig. S3). Thus, although we cannot rule out some contribution of dynein to intrakinetochore stretch, the effects of ZW10 RNAi cannot be explained solely by the reduction of dynein levels at the kinetochore.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Interkinetochore distance and delta can be experimentally uncoupled.</bold> (A) Selected frames from time-lapse imaging of GFP-tubulin cells after ZW10 RNAi treatment.

Because we could control delta and interkinetochore distance experimentally, we next set out to determine which of these parameters correlated with 3F3/2 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Microtubule depolymerization with colchicine, which reduced both interkinetochore distance and delta, induced the highest levels of 3F3/2 staining. In control metaphase cells, 3F3/2 levels dropped two- to fourfold (a mean of 2.4-fold) relative to colchicine-treated cells. Experimental conditions that yielded delta near control levels on bioriented chromosomes (20 nM taxol and SMC1, DHC, and Ncd RNAi) all had 3F3/2 staining near control levels, and, with the exception of DHC RNAi, which fails to remove Mad1/Mad2 from kinetochores, all satisfied the SAC even though interkinetochore distances varied 30-fold. However, conditions that yielded &#x0003e;40% reduction in intrakinetochore stretch (colchicine, Ncd RNAi + 1 &#x000b5;M taxol, DHC RNAi + 1 &#x000b5;M taxol, and ZW10 RNAi) had elevated levels of 3F3/2 and, with the exception of ZW10, which lacks a functional checkpoint, activated the SAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref> and Figs.

Collectively, these data demonstrate that levels of the tension-sensitive 3F3/2 phosphoepitope correlates inversely with delta (high delta = low 3F3/2 and low delta = high 3F3/2) rather than simply centromere stretch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Furthermore, SAC activation correlated with a reduction in delta rather than centromere stretch.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of the tension-sensitive phosphoepitope 3F3/2 correlates with changes in delta.</bold> (A) Representative micrographs from each of the indicated conditions. In the merged images, DNA is blue, CID is red, and 3F3/2 is green. (B) The ratio of fluorescent intensities for 3F3/2-CID signals versus centromere stretch, intrakinetochore stretch, and mitotic progression is shown for each experimental condition. The 3F3/2 levels (<italic>n</italic> = 373 pairs from seven experiments), centromere stretch, kinetochore stretch, and mitotic progression for control + DMSO cells were each assigned a value of 100%, and all other experimental conditions were normalized accordingly. Colchicine treatment results in a 2.4-fold increase in 3F3/2 levels (<italic>n</italic> = 522 kinetochore pairs from nine experiments) and a reduction of kinetochore and centromere stretches to their minima (rest lengths) as well as a mitotic delay. 20 nM taxol does not cause a mitotic delay or elevated levels of 3F3/2 (<italic>n</italic> = 102 pairs from three experiments) despite an &#x0223c;90% reduction in centromere stretch. Ncd RNAi + DMSO (3F3/2 measurements: <italic>n</italic> = 154 pairs from three experiments) behave similar to control cells; however, addition of 1 &#x000b5;M taxol to Ncd RNAi cells causes a 2.4-fold increase in 3F3/2 levels (<italic>n</italic> = 161 pairs from three experiments), a 65% reduction in centromere and kinetochore stretches, and a mitotic delay. ZW10 RNAi cells (<italic>n</italic> = 189 pairs from three experiments) have 1.8-fold higher levels of 3F3/2 and an &#x0223c;40% reduction in both centromere stretch and kinetochore stretch but progress through mitosis faster than control cells. SMC1 RNAi cells have levels of 3F3/2 staining similar to controls (<italic>n</italic> = 144 pairs from three experiments), hyperstretched centromeres, normal kinetochore stretch, and normal mitotic progression. The error bars represent the standard deviations. Bar, 10 &#x000b5;m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200808130_RGB_Fig5"/></fig><p>The mechanical elements responsible for intrakinetochore stretch in control metaphase cells exhibited a much different behavior than those for centromere stretch. The latter exhibited a wide range of length changes dependent on biorientation, sister chromatid linkages (SMC1 depletion), and suppression of microtubule dynamics with taxol. In contrast, intrakinetochore stretch did not behave as a linearly elastic element. Thus, it is possible that the kinetochore contains a molecular switch with an &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; conformation for distances between 65 and 87 nm and an &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; conformation for deltas near 100 nm; &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; corresponds to high levels of 3F3/2 phosphorylation and an active SAC. Strong yet flexible filaments of finite lengths that connect the inner and outer kinetochore may limit intrakinetochore stretch to &#x0223c;100 nm as the centromere becomes stretched above its rest length.</p><p>Changes in delta could partly be explained by structural rearrangements within the kinetochore after microtubule attachment, as previously observed by electron tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dong et al., 2007</xref>). Because microtubule depolymerization with colchicine yielded a mean delta of 65 nm, whereas 1-&#x000b5;M taxol treatment of Ncd RNAi cells had a mean delta of 78 nm, microtubule attachment alone may account for &#x0223c;10&#x02013;15 nm of intrakinetochore stretch at metaphase. How is the remaining 20 nm of intrakinetochore stretch generated? 1-&#x000b5;M taxol treatment reduced the majority of both centromere stretch and delta. In contrast, 20 nm taxol, which also greatly reduced centromere stretch, did not dramatically reduce delta. This indicates that force generation, driven primarily by plus end dynamics of kinetochore microtubules, generates the necessary intrakinetochore stretch that contributes to 3F3/2 phosphorylation and SAC activity. Furthermore, this stretch is likely to require low levels of force that can still be generated by the significantly dampened microtubule dynamics in 20 nM taxol that we believe are completely suppressed by 1-&#x000b5;M taxol treatment. Our data do not exclude the ability for tension generated by centromere stretch to produce intrakinetochore stretch; however, it does show that intrakinetochore stretch occurs at very low levels of centromere stretch and requires dynamic microtubules.</p><p>Our data also show that changes in delta rather than centromere stretch correlate with 3F3/2 phosphorylation. Importantly, a reduction in delta also correlates with SAC activation when a functional checkpoint pathway is present. Furthermore, we believe that any SAC mechanism that is regulated by intrakinetochore stretch must be upstream of kinetochore-bound Mad1/Mad2 for two reasons: (1) ZW10 RNAi, which prevents Mad1/Mad2 from binding kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buffin et al., 2005</xref>), fails to arrest cells even with reduced delta and elevated levels of 3F3/2, and (2) DHC RNAi, which prevents stripping of Mad1/Mad2 from kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Griffis et al., 2007</xref>), causes a mitotic delay even with high delta and reduced levels of 3F3/2.</p><p>In conclusion, we postulate that intrakinetochore stretch is generated by the translocation of protein elements in response to the attachment of dynamic microtubules. Furthermore, this movement may behave like a low-tension &#x0201c;mechanical switch&#x0201d; that controls SAC activity by changing the relative proximity and localization of regulatory factors within the kinetochore. Future investigation of this hypothesis will have significant implications for kinetochore structure, mechanics, and SAC function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and RNAi</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells were cultured at 24&#x000b0;C in Schneider&#x02019;s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen) and 0.5&#x000d7; antibiotic&#x02013;antimycotic cocktail (Invitrogen).
