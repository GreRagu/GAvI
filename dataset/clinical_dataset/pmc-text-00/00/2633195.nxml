Human mesangial cells treated with L-arginine were cultured on Dulbecco's modified eagle medium in the presence and absence of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor and GTE. The cell proliferation was determined by 3 (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphengltetrqzolium bromide, a tetrazole assay. The iNOS mRNA and its protein expression were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. The concentration of nitric oxide (NO) was measured by NO enzyme-linced immuno sorbent assay kit. L-arginine significantly inhibited the proliferation of human mesangial cells, and induced the secretion of NO to the media. NO production by L-arginine was significantly suppressed by GTE and iNOS inhibitor (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). The expression level of iNOS mRNA and its protein that was significantly increased by L-arginine was decreased by iNOS inhibitor but not by GTE. GTE protected the mesangial cells from the NO-mediated cytotoxicity by scavenging the NO rather than by iNOS gene expression. Therefore, we conclude that GTE has some protective effect for renal cells against oxidative injury possibly by polyphenols contained in GTE.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Green Tea Extract</kwd><kwd>Arginine</kwd><kwd>Nitric Oxide</kwd><kwd>Polyphenols</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Kidney is the main site of endogenous L-arginine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). L-arginine used in the protein synthesis is a material for transport, storage and excretion of nitrous products. Especially, L-arginine is main substance of guanidine products such as creatinine and methylguanidine which are considered as uremic toxins. All of these L-arginine metabolites are involved in renal pathophysiology.</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO), as a secondary messenger, is formed in the process of oxidation of L-arginine guanidine nitrogen to L-citrulline in cytoplasm. The role of NO in kidney is of importance not only in the modulation of renal hemodynamics but also in the regulation of renal tubular and glomerular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) pathways which exist in the glomerular mesangial cells, the monocyte, the macrophage and vascular smooth muscle cells are activated by various cytokines in pathologic conditions. The iNOS, induced by many cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and lipopolysaccharide, is a mediator to outside injury or inflammation in immune defense mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Excess NO is locally formed and damages the kidney. The NO produced by excess arginine as well as the creatine and methylguanidin is the major factor to kidney injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>More and more attentions have been paid to the protective effects of natural antioxidants against drug-induced toxicities especially when free radical generations are involved. Tea has many advantages over chemicals since it contains several antioxidants including polyphenols of catechin and theaflavin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Green tea has received a lot of attention owing to its role as an antioxidant and free radicals scavenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). It is well known that green tea has anti-cancer, anti-diabetics and anti-hypertensive actions in the clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the antioxidative effects of green tea extract on human mesangial cells with L-arginine induced toxicity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Green tea extract (GTE)</title><p>GTE was prepared from a hot-water extract of green tea (Boseong, Gwangju, Korea) as described by Maity et al.

In this study, the components of GTE were EGCG (28% by weight), epigallocatechin (15%), gallocatechin (15%), gallocatechin gallate (10%), epicatechin (7%), epicatechin-3-gallate (5%), catechin (4%). EGCG, the main polyphenol in green tea, has been suggested to participate in the elimination of the uremic toxins, and thus, ameliorate renal disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The mechanisms of green tea polyphenol were suggested as follows. First, green tea polyphenols increase the bioactivities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase, which inactivate free oxygen radicals like O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. Furthermore, because O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> can react with NO by forming ONOO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, green tea polyphenols may reduce NO loss and maintain NO physical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Second, green tea polyphenol may inhibit the synthesis of thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> (TXA<sub>2</sub>) and leukotrienes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The potent vasoconstrictive effects of TXA<sub>2</sub> and leukotrienes contribute to the activation of the renin-angiotensin system. There are intrarenal angiotensin II deposits and excessive expression of angiotensin II type I receptor expression has been observed in the renal medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Future studies are needed to demonstrate the other mechanisms, such as effects of renin-angiotensin systems, of GTE in vitro and vivo.</p><p>Excessive dietary arginine evokes renal failure by increasing the production of NO in the kidney. Lui et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) showed that L-arginine could exert in inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human mesangial cells and the production of extracellular components. In the present study, the administration of excess L-arginine inhibited the proliferation of mesangial cells and increased the concentration of NO. Noris et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) reported that arginine levels and NO synthesis were higher in uremic patients than in healthy volunteers, suggesting an explanation for the increased NO synthesis in uremia. Also, in the present study, combined NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> levels was higher in arginine-given mesangial cells than in arginine-free mesangial cells. It raises the possibility that the increase in NO production may be attributable to dietary arginine and that it may cause renal injury.</p><p>Therefore, green tea polyphenol suppresses the production of NO and it would be expected to ameliorate the renal injury induced by excessive arginine. Furthermore, green tea polyphenol has a potent scavenging effect through the inhibition of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Yokozawa et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) suggested that excessive arginine affected the activity of antioxidative enzymes in the renal peroxisomes and the reductions in the SOD and catalase activities induced by arginine imply that oxygen-derived free radicals were generated and the biological defense system was weakened but the administration of green tea polyphenol increased the activities of SOD and catalase. In the present study, GTE increased the inhibited proliferation of mesangial cells by L-arginine and suppressed the increase in NO concentration after L-arginine treatment.</p><p>In summary, GTE might play a crucial role of NO inhibition as free radical scavenging effect rather than iNOS inhibition. In addition, it was found to ameliorate anti-proliferative effect of L-arginine in mesangial cells, which suggests that GTE, and probably its polyphenols, can protect renal cells against oxidative injury. Future studies are needed to demonstrate the antioxidant effects and other effects of GTE on renal diseases.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This study was supported by grants from the <funding-source>Clinical Medicine Research Institute</funding-source> at Chosun University Hospital, 2007.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Visek</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Arginine needs physiological state and usual diets.
