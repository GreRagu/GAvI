Leukemias and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) are the most predominant FA associated cancers, with the latter exhibiting markedly early disease onset and aggressiveness. While studies of hematopoietic cells derived from FA patients have provided much insight into bone marrow deficiencies and leukemogenesis, molecular transforming events in FA deficient keratinocytes, which are the cell type of origin for SCC, are poorly understood. We describe here the growth and molecular properties of FANCA-deficient versus FANCA-corrected, HPV E6/E7 immortalized keratinocytes in monolayer and organotypic epithelial raft culture. In response to DNA damage, FANCA-deficient patient-derived keratinocyte cultures displayed a G2/M phase arrest, senescence and apoptosis. Organotypic raft cultures exhibited DNA repair associated defects with more 53BP1 foci and TUNEL positive cells over their corrected counterparts. Interestingly, together with reduced rates of DNA damage, FA correction resulted in a marked decrease in epithelial thickness and the presence of fewer cell layers. The observed FANCA mediated suppression of hyperplasia correlated with the detection of fewer cells transiting through the cell cycle in the absence of gross differentiation abnormalities or apoptotic differences. Importantly, the knockdown of either FANCA or FANCD2 in HPV positive keratinocytes was sufficient for increasing epithelial hyperplasia. Our findings support a new role for FA pathways in the maintenance of differentiation-dependent cell cycle exit, with the implication that FA deficiencies may contribute to the high risk of FA patients for developing HPV-associated SCC.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Fanconi anemia</kwd><kwd>human papillomavirus</kwd></kwd-group><contract-num rid="CA1">R01 CA102357-04||CA</contract-num><contract-num rid="CA1">R01 CA102357-03||CA</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="CA1">National Cancer Institute : NCI</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Fanconi anemia is a rare, recessive DNA instability syndrome and is usually diagnosed early in life based on congenital abnormalities, progressive aplastic anemia, cellular hypersensitivity to DNA damage, and a greatly increased risk of cancer. FA-associated anemia is often fatal and presents a median life expectancy of 20 years in the absence of a bone marrow transplant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alter, 2003</xref>). Thirteen FA complementation groups were identified by cell fusion experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Wang, 2007</xref>) and more recently by retroviral complementation of specific FA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Chandra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Hanenberg et al., 2002</xref>). FA pathway functionality involves a high molecular weight nuclear core complex composed of FA proteins FANCA, B, C, G, E, F, G, L, M, FAAP24 and FAAP100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Meetei et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Meetei et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Niedernhofer et al., 2005</xref>).

Complex activation then mediates DNA repair via poorly understood mechanisms that likely include the BRAFT complex, as FA proteins are components of the larger BRAFT DNA repair complex containing Bloom&#x02019;s helicase (BLM), replication protein A (RPA) and topoisomerase IIIa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Meetei et al., 2003b</xref>).

Research has focused mainly on the hematopoietic problems in FA patients, which can now be cured with a successful bone marrow transplant under optimal circumstances. However, FA patients who have undergone bone marrow transplants continue to be at high risk for developing solid tumors. Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the head and neck (HN), anogenital region and skin are the most commonly diagnosed solid tumors in FA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kutler et al., 2003b</xref>), supporting important and independent FA functions in human keratinocytes. A potential link between HPV and FA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kutler et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kutler et al., 2003c</xref>) &#x02013; albeit controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">van Zeeburg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">van Zeeburg et al., 2005</xref>) &#x02013; is supported by a recent report showing accelerated chromosomal instability in HPV16 E7 oncogene expressing, FA deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Spardy et al., 2007</xref>). FA deficiency may accelerate tumorigenesis by promoting genomic instability that cooperates with HPV mediated inactivation of critical tumor suppressors. Examination of FA specific keratinocyte phenotypes in premalignant cells, particularly in the context of the HPV oncogenes, is critical for a deeper understanding of SCC development in FA patients.</p><p id="P4">Keratinocytes are the cell type of origin for SCC, but only one report has described some of the phenotypic characteristics of FA patient-derived epithelial cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">van Zeeburg et al., 2005</xref>). Since keratinocyte differentiation as a major barrier to cancer has already been overcome in such tumors, the use of the above cell lines has not provided insights into the consequences of FA inactivation in the context of differentiation. Here we describe the culture, FA correction known as complementation, and characterization of HPV18 E6/E7 immortalized keratinocytes derived from a FANCA patient skin biopsy. This system explores the role of FA in an oncogenically challenged, premalignant state, and within three-dimensional epithelium. FANCA deficiency in E6/E7 positive monolayer cells did not result in significant changes in proliferation or cell death under normal culture conditions. However, in response to DNA damaging agents, phenotypes similar to those described for hematopoietic and stromal cells were evident. These included the lack of FANCD2 monoubiquitination, cell cycle arrest and increased rates of cell death. Interestingly, under differentiating conditions, FANCA complementation decreased HPV associated hyperplasia in organotypic epithelial rafts in correlation with a decrease in the proliferative index. Notable differences in the localization of differentiation markers were not observed. Conversely, FANCA or FANCD2 knockdown in HPV positive cells increased HPV associated hyperplasia. Taken together, our data demonstrate that HPV associated hyperplasia in FANCA mutant epithelium can be attenuated by the re-establishment of a functional FA pathway, and that the loss of FA pathways in HPV positive keratinocytes inhibits differentiation-associated cell cycle withdrawal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cell culture and vectors</title><p id="P5">Fresh skin biopsies were obtained through the Fanconi Anemia Comprehensive Care Center from patients undergoing clinically-indicated bone marrow aspiration, and keratinocytes were cultured on irradiated J2-3T3 feeder cells as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Nakahara et al., 2005</xref>).

Detection of FANCD2 foci in FANCA expressing, but not deficient rafts confirmed successful complementation in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We next quantitated nuclear 53BP1 foci in FANCA deficient versus complemented rafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>). 53BP1 is a component of the DNA damage response and sensor of DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Huyen et al., 2004</xref>). Numbers of cells with detectable nuclear 53BP1 foci as well as numbers of foci per nucleus were substantially increased in FANCA deficient compared to complemented rafts. The observed overactivated 53BP1 response is likely a consequence of intracellular accumulation of DNA damage in FA deficient rafts. To further support this notion, we quantitated double stranded DNA ends on FANCA deficient and complemented rafts by TUNEL staining. In total, over 1100 nuclei were counted for each raft. Excluding enucleating cells in the cornified layer, we detected increased numbers of TUNEL positive cells in the FANCA deficient rafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>).

Hematoxylin and eosin staining demonstrated increased raft thickness and the presence of additional spinous cell layers in the FANCA deficient compared to the complemented rafts. Similar phenotypes were noted in two additional, independently derived epithelial rafts obtained from the same cell populations (data not shown). Hyperplasia was reflected by increased numbers of nuclei in the suprabasal compartment. Closer morphological examination revealed approximately equal numbers of dysplastic and dyskeratotic cells, likely related to E6/E7 expression, in both rafts (data not shown). Epithelial differentiation and maturation properties were also similar as verified by comparable patterns of expression of the basal cell marker K14 and the suprabasal cell marker K10 by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A, bottom two panels</xref>). Detection of the adherens junction component E-cadherin revealed more E-cadherin positive cell layers, likely a reflection of increased raft thickness, in the FANCA deficient epithelium. However, we did not note obvious E-cadherin mis-localization and/or expression at a single cell level, indicating similar cell-cell contact properties in the FANCA deficient versus complemented epithelium. A marked reduction in hyperplasia was also observed upon FANCA complementation of HPV16 episome-immortalized FA patient keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Conversely, we detected an increase in hyperplasia following lentiviral knockdown of FANCA in HPV positive normal human keratinocytes (NIKs) and subsequent raft generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), thus ruling out the possibility that clonal selection might have been associated with the observed differences between FANCA deficient versus sufficient patient-derived keratinocytes. We cannot fully exclude the possibility that increased hyperplasia is a consequence of subtle cellular adaptation to FA loss that was undetectable in 2D culture. However, if proliferative gains and epithelial hyperplasia are adaptive in nature, our data would support that they remain reversible through the re-instatement of functional FA pathways by complementation.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Reduced rates of proliferation in FANCA complemented epithelium</title><p id="P17">We next determined directly whether reduced proliferation might be responsible for the suppression of hyperplasia by FANCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Detection of the proliferation marker Ki67 in the HPV18 E6/E7 positive patient derived rafts from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> revealed a decreased proliferative index in the FANCA complemented compared to the deficient rafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Quantitation of Ki67 and BrdU positive cells in the HPV16 immortalized rafts from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref> revealed similar decreases in the number of cells transiting through the cell cycle following complementation. Immunofluorescence detection of activated caspase 3 did not reveal an increased apoptotic index in the FANCA complemented rafts (data not shown). We concluded that increased proliferative rates were responsible for the hyperplastic differences in the FANCA-deficient compared to the complemented rafts. In order to further confirm this notion and to determine whether FA complex formation rather than a FANCA-specific effect was responsible, HPV positive NIKs were utilized for the lentiviral knockdown of FANCD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Cells were infected as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2">materials and methods</xref>, selected in puromycin and carried on feeders without obvious differences in cellular growth. Organotypic rafts were generated, and 10uM BrdU was added 48 hrs prior to raft harvest. BrdU detection by immunofluorescence revealed increased proliferation in the FANCD2 knockdown rafts. Taken together, our data support the notion that FA pathway deficiency weakens control of differentiation-associated cell cycle exit and that increased hyperplasia in FA deficient epithelium is reversible by FA correction.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">Our data support the notion that FA deficient human keratinocytes &#x02013; like hematopoietic and stromal cells &#x02013; respond to DNA damage by exaggerated cell death. However, clinical observations suggest keratinocyte specific differences, perhaps through differential adaptation, might also exist. Specifically, extreme radiosensitivity of FA mutant oropharyngeal epithelium is not shared by fibroblast cultures derived from the same patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Marcou et al., 2001</xref>). Such cell type differences may influence the timing of disease manifestation in distinct organs: anemia and leukemia are often diagnosed early, whereas SCC development is generally not observed until later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alter, 2003</xref>). Significant insight into the role of FA proteins in hematopoietic cells and fibroblasts has emerged in the past years, but no information is available on the role of FA pathways in differentiating keratinocytes. In light of likely keratinocyte specific FA phenotypes and their importance to SCC development, we chose to examine effects of FANCA loss on epithelial cells using patient-derived, FANCA deficient keratinocytes.</p><p id="P19">Primary cells from an FANCA deficient patient biopsy were immortalized with the HPV18 E6/E7 oncogenes, which are well characterized for their ability to inhibit cellular tumor suppressor pathways and to cause chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Duensing &#x00026; Munger, 2004</xref>). Immortalized cells were subsequently complemented with FANCA by retroviral gene transfer. This culture system probed the effect of FANCA deficiency in the context of oncogenic challenge, but not in the primary state. The difficulty of culturing primary cutaneous keratinocytes from fresh specimen, both FA and normal, has so far precluded such analyses. Extending the short cellular life span of post-natal skin keratinocytes through better culture conditions will be required before meaningful growth comparisons between cells from FA patients versus normal donors can be initiated. Whether similar FA-dependent phenotypes will be observed in primary patient derived cells or in cells immortalized with other viral and cellular oncogenes remains to be determined in the future. However, E6/E7 immortalization is particularly relevant for these studies since a link has been suggested between FA and HPV associated disease. Specifically, in one study, 84% of FA associated SCCs were reported to contain genomic DNA from the high-risk human papillomaviruses compared to only 36% of SCCs in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Kutler et al., 2003c</xref>). A link between FA and HPV is further supported by a recent report on accelerated chromosomal instability in FA deficient, HPV16 E7 oncogene expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">Spardy et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, HPV DNA was not detectable in a cohort of Dutch FA patients with head and neck SCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">van Zeeburg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">van Zeeburg et al., 2005</xref>). Reconciling these findings will require more extensive epidemiological and molecular studies of FA SCC samples in a manner that considers geographical and technical differences between the above studies.</p><p id="P20">Our studies uncover several specific defects in FANCA deficient keratinocytes which are similar to those described for FA hematopoietic and stromal cells. These relate to the known roles of FA genes in the maintenance of genome stability. Under standard monolayer culture conditions, FA status in the keratinocyte populations did not significantly affect steady state cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In contrast, typical hallmarks of FA deficient hematopoietic and stromal cells were evident under conditions of exogenous DNA damage. These included a lack of FANCD2 monoubiquitination and focus formation, increased G2/M cell cycle arrest in response to melphalan, and apoptosis and senescence induction in response to mitomycin C. These phenotypes have already been utilized for the clinical diagnosis of FA mutations in various settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Taniguchi &#x00026; D'Andrea, 2006</xref>), and add to the reported finding that FA cancer cell lines exhibit sensitivity to cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">van Zeeburg et al., 2005</xref>). Hallmarks of DNA damage further extended to FA deficient three-dimensional epithelium as evidenced by 53BP1 and TUNEL positivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Taken together, like immortalized hematopoietic and stromal cells, keratinocytes require a functional FA pathway under conditions of genotoxic stress.</p><p id="P21">The HPV oncogenes are well known to mediate unscheduled re-entry of differentiated cells into S phase and resulting hyperplasia, but their presence does not inhibit full execution of the cellular differentiation program. Uncoupling cell cycle exit from differentiation provides optimal replication conditions for the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Longworth &#x00026; Laimins, 2004</xref>). HPV18 E6/E7-associated hyperplasia in FA deficient epithelium was observed as expected, and importantly, could be significantly attenuated by the re-introduction of FANCA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Similarly, HPV16-associated cellular hyperplasia was attenuated by complementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Together, these data suggest that FA complementation may be a useful approach for the treatment of high risk HPV positive lesions, and may apply to lesions that maintain episomal HPV DNA. The observed differences between FA mutant and complemented epithelia correlated with decreased proliferative rates in a small subpopulation of cells within the suprabasal compartment. Conversely, FANCD2 knockdown in an HPV genome positive immortalized keratinocyte cell line increased the proliferative index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>), thus supporting the hypothesis that FA deficiency stimulates hyperplasia in differentiated epithelium. Increased numbers of proliferating cells in FANCA and FANCD2 knockdown rafts would appear to implicate core complex- rather than FANCA-specific functions. Importantly, proliferative differences that are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref> are only observed in a 3D context, and represent a small proportion of the raft compared to the vast excess of differentiated cells. It is therefore not surprising that the underlying biochemical mechanisms are not yet known. However, since some of the known cellular targets of E7, including the Rb pocket proteins and p21, represent critical links between cellular differentiation and cell cycle control, these molecules might be considered possible candidate mediators for FA-dependent cell cycle control.</p><p id="P22">Relatively subtle abnormalities within FA deficient epithelium as observed would explain the clinical lack of obvious skin defects, yet a high risk of SCC, in FA patients. The fact that FA complementation can inhibit E6/E7 driven hyperplasia suggests that intact FA functions can serve as a barrier to E6/E7&#x02013; stimulated cell cycle abnormalities. It will be important to determine whether somatic FA mutations may be selected for during HPV SCC development in the general population. The loss of such functions in the FA patient population may explain the up to thousand fold increased risk for developing SCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Kutler et al., 2003b</xref>), and we suggest that the pursuit of FA gene correction for the treatment of FA SCC might be a worthwhile clinical endeavor in the future. Taken together, our findings point to a novel role for the FA pathway in suppressing viral oncogene induced cellular abnormalities.</p><p id="P23">SCC in FA patients presents at a particularly early patient age, generally with aggressive disease course and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Kutler et al., 2003a</xref>): surgical treatment remains the mainstay, but relapse-free, two-year survival rates are below 50%. Short term toxicity following the radiotherapy of FA patients &#x02013; both as a conditioning regimen and as a treatment for SCC &#x02013; has been noted in bystander epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Alter, 2002</xref>). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies confirm at a molecular level that FA deficient cells and epithelium exhibit hypersensitivity to DNA damage induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Subsequent formation of secondary cancers within the same area of FA patients has overshadowed the initial success of the above patient treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Bremer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Guardiola et al., 2004</xref>), and was perhaps due to the selection of surviving clones in an environment of genomic instability. We suggest that the hyperplastic phenotype in FA deficient epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>) might represent a clinically relevant precursor to SCC. Continued studies of this model will explore the underlying molecular pathways involved in SCC progression, and will provide a foundation for the preclinical testing of new therapies. FA is a rare genetic disease; however, somatic inactivation of the FA pathway has been widely observed in sporadic cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Mathew, 2006</xref>). In this way, the above model system is also expected to advance our understanding of FA deficient SCC in the general population.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S18" sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures</title><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Complementation and characterization of FANCA deficient keratinocyte cell lines</title><p id="P24">Primary keratinocytes from a FANCA deficient patient were immortalized with an HPV18 E6/E7 expressing retroviral vector and then complemented either with empty MIEG or FANCA expressing retrovirus. <bold>A.</bold> Western blot analysis was performed after treatment with 0.5 mM HU.
