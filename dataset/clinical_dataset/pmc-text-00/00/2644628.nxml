INTRODUCTION</title><p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (<sc>egfr</sc>) is a trans-membrane glycoprotein that is expressed in many normal human cells of epithelial origin, playing an important role in cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. The receptor consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-co16-1-16">1</xref>.</p><p>In many solid tumours, including most gastrointestinal (<sc>gi</sc>) malignancies, <sc>egfr</sc> is overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-co16-1-16">2</xref>. Dysregulated <sc>egfr</sc> may result in uncontrolled cell growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis, and is associated with a poorer prognosis, manifested by increased metastatic potential and poorer overall survival (<sc>os</sc>) times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-co16-1-16">3</xref>. Thus, <sc>egfr</sc> is an ideal target for antitumour therapy. Inhibitors of this target can be broadly classified as either tyrosine kinase inhibitors (<sc>tki</sc>s) or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), both of which can produce significant skin toxicity.</p><p>The <sc>egfr</sc>-blocking <sc>tki</sc>s have been the subject of several publications on skin rash, and therefore the present article focuses on management of rash resulting from <sc>egfr</sc>-targeted mAbs for the treatment of <sc>gi</sc> malignancy. Although the management of rash caused by <sc>tki</sc>s and mAbs is clinically similar, there are differences between these two classes of <sc>egfr</sc>-targeted agents with regard to the incidence, severity, and onset of this skin toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>2. EGFR-TARGETED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES</title><p>The <sc>egfr</sc>-targeted mAbs are given intravenously and act by binding the extracellular domain, thus blocking ligand binding and tyrosine phosphorylation. In Canada, two mAbs have been approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (m<sc>crc</sc>): cetuximab and panitumumab (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tI-co16-1-16">TABLE I</xref>).</p><p>Cetuximab (Erbitux: Bristol&#x02013;Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, U.S.A.) is a recombinant human/mouse (chimeric) immunoglobulin G1 mAb that is administered once weekly. Cetuximab in combination with irinotecan (Camptosar: Pfizer Canada, Kirkland, QC) is indicated in Canada for the treatment of <sc>egfr</sc>-expressing m<sc>crc</sc> in patients who are refractory to other irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimens. It is also indicated as monotherapy for <sc>egfr</sc>-expressing m<sc>crc</sc> in patients with intolerance to irinotecan-based chemotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-co16-1-16">4</xref>.</p><p>Panitumumab (Vectibix: Amgen Canada, Mississauga, ON) is a fully-human immunoglobulin G2 mAb administered once every 2 weeks. Panitumumab is indicated as monotherapy for patients with <sc>egfr</sc>-expressing m<sc>crc</sc> and with non-mutated [wild-type (<sc>wt</sc>)] <italic>KRAS</italic> after disease progression on fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-co16-1-16">5</xref>. Panitumumab became available in Canada in summer 2008 and was added to the Ontario provincial drug program in November 2008.</p><sec><title>2.1 Efficacy of EGFR-Targeted mAbs for Third-Line Therapy of Advanced Colorectal Malignancy</title><p>The <sc>egfr</sc>-targeted mAbs have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of advanced colorectal malignancy in a number of clinical trials (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tII-co16-1-16">TABLE II</xref>).</p><p>In a randomized phase <sc>iii</sc> study of chemotherapy-refractory m<sc>crc</sc>, panitumumab monotherapy almost halved the risk of disease progression as compared with progression in a best supportive care (<sc>bsc</sc>) control group [hazard ratio (<sc>hr</sc>): 0.54; 95% confidence interval (<sc>ci</sc>): 0.44 to 0.66; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001]. No significant difference was observed in <sc>os</sc>, likely because of the high percentage (76%) of <sc>bsc</sc> patients who crossed over to panitumumab at disease progression. Objective response was observed in 10% of patients randomized to panitumumab and in 11% of patients crossing over to this agent, as compared with 0% in the <sc>bsc</sc> group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-co16-1-16">9</xref>.</p><p>A retrospective analysis of the phase <sc>iii</sc> study examined the influence of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation status on the therapeutic efficacy of panitumumab. That analysis reported that progression-free survival (<sc>pfs</sc>) was significantly greater in patients with <sc>wt</sc> <italic>KRAS</italic> than in patients with a mutant gene (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Median <sc>pfs</sc> in <sc>wt</sc> <italic>KRAS</italic> patients was 12.3 weeks for the panitumumab group as compared with 7.3 weeks for the <sc>bsc</sc> group. To account for potential tumour-ascertainment bias in favour of the <sc>bsc</sc> arm, an interval-censored sensitivity analysis was performed in which radiologic event times were moved to the closest assessment time pre-specified in the study protocol. That analysis showed median <sc>pfs</sc> times of 16 weeks and 8 weeks with panitumumab and <sc>bsc</sc> respectively (<sc>hr</sc>: 0.44; 95% <sc>ci</sc>: 0.30 to 0.63). No significant difference in <sc>os</sc> was observed between treatment arms for all patients (<sc>hr</sc>: 0.97; 95% <sc>ci</sc>: 0.79 to 1.18) or between <italic>KRAS</italic> groups (mutant gene&#x02014;<sc>hr</sc>: 1.02; 95% <sc>ci</sc>: 0.75 to 1.39; <sc>wt</sc> gene&#x02014;<sc>hr</sc>: 0.99; 95% <sc>ci</sc>: 0.75 to 1.29) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-co16-1-16">7</xref>. This report confirmed that, in terms of <sc>pfs</sc>, the efficacy of panitumumab monotherapy for m<sc>crc</sc> is limited to patients with <sc>wt</sc> <italic>KRAS</italic> tumours. Accordingly, <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation status must be evaluated to optimize selection of patients with m<sc>crc</sc> for panitumumab monotherapy.</p><p>The efficacy of cetuximab monotherapy was evaluated in a phase <sc>iii</sc> National Cancer Institute of Canada (<sc>ncic</sc>) trial that randomized chemotherapy-refractory m<sc>crc</sc> patients to cetuximab monotherapy or <sc>bsc</sc>. Compared with <sc>bsc</sc> alone, cetuximab treatment was associated with significant improvements in <sc>pfs</sc> (<sc>hr</sc>: 0.68; 95% <sc>ci</sc>: 0.57 to 0.80; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and <sc>os</sc> (<sc>hr</sc>: 0.77; 95% <sc>ci</sc>: 0.64 to 0.92; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005).

This <sc>ncic</sc> trial did not allow crossover to active therapy for patients initially randomized to receive <sc>bsc</sc> alone.</p><p>A Cox model analysis of the study examined the predictive effect of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation status on <sc>os</sc> and <sc>pfs</sc>. The authors reported that the effect of cetuximab was significantly greater in the <sc>wt</sc> <italic>KRAS</italic> group than in the mutant gene group both for <sc>pfs</sc> (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) and for <sc>os</sc> (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). No significant difference in <sc>os</sc> as a function of <italic>KRAS</italic> status (<sc>wt</sc> vs. mutant) was observed in the <sc>bsc</sc> arm (<sc>hr</sc>: 1.01; 95% <sc>ci</sc>: 0.74 to 1.37; <italic>p</italic> = 0.97).

Skin rash is mostly mild-to-moderate in severity and requires therapeutic intervention in about one third of patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-co16-1-16">12</xref>. Although the skin rash is self-limiting and usually resolves without scarring upon discontinuation of anti-<sc>egfr</sc> therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-co16-1-16">13</xref>, the condition can negatively affect treatment compliance and quality of life.

Moreover, significant pain and pruritus, and anxiety related to the cosmetic appearance of the rash can negatively affect patient quality of life.

Proactive strategies for the management of <sc>egfri</sc>-mediated skin rash may help to maximize benefit for patients by minimizing the negative effects on quality of life and maintaining an optimal mAb dose.</p><p>The next section of this article reviews the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and incidence of skin rash resulting from mAb therapy in colorectal cancer and presents a practical treatment algorithm summarizing recommendations&#x02014;from a Canadian perspective&#x02014;for the management of this skin toxicity.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, CLINICAL PRESENTATION, AND INCIDENCE OF SKIN RASH</title><sec><title>3.1 Pathophysiology of mAb-Mediated Skin Rash</title><p>Epidermal growth factor receptor is normally expressed in the epidermis, sebaceous glands, and hair follicular epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-co16-1-16">16</xref>, where it plays a number of important roles in the maintenance of normal skin health, including control of differentiation, protection against damage induced by ultraviolet radiation, inhibition of inflammation, and acceleration of wound healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-co16-1-16">17</xref>. Although the exact mechanism of skin rash mediated by <sc>egfr</sc>-targeted mAb is incompletely understood, inhibition of <sc>egfr</sc> is believed to cause follicular occlusion and rupture because of premature epithelial differentiation and an increase in the expression of genes that stimulate inflammation, apoptosis, and cell attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-co16-1-16">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-co16-1-16">18</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-co16-1-16">FIGURE 1</xref>). This altered permeability barrier may also allow for the promotion of bacterial overgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-co16-1-16">20</xref>, further exacerbating cutaneous injury and development of the characteristic skin rash.</p></sec><sec><title>3.2 Description and Incidence of Skin Rash Mediated by EGFR-Targeted mAb</title><p>Treatment with <sc>egfri</sc> is associated with a spectrum of epidermal-derived toxicities. Although papulopustular skin rash is the most common skin toxicity associated with <sc>egfr</sc>-targeted mAbs (and the focus of this article), other less frequent side effects can include dry skin, pruritus, fissures, palmar&#x02013;plantar rash, hyperkeratosis, telangiectasia, hyperpigmentation, blisters, mucositis, and pyogenic granuloma. Changes may also occur to the hair (for example, alopecia of the scalp or trichomegaly of the eyelashes) and nails (usually periungual manifestations such as paronychia) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-co16-1-16">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-co16-1-16">21</xref>.</p><p>In general, skin rash associated with the use of <sc>egfr</sc>-targeted mAbs tends to be more severe and to occur with higher incidence than is observed with <sc>tki</sc>s.

Interest in the development of primary pre-emptive strategies has grown as recognition of the spectrum of skin toxicity has evolved and so as to minimize dose reduction or treatment discontinuation, which both potentially compromise the clinical benefit of <sc>egfri</sc>s. As a result, a small number of randomized controlled trials have been designed to evaluate primary preemptive strategies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tV-co16-1-16">TABLE V</xref>).</p><p>A controlled study called <sc>stepp</sc> (Skin Toxicity Evaluation Protocol with Panitumumab) is the first prospective trial designed specifically to compare primary pre-emption with reactive treatment for <sc>egfri</sc>-mediated skin toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-co16-1-16">36</xref>. Patients receiving second-line <sc>folfiri</sc> (fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan)&#x02013;based chemotherapy plus every-second-week panitumumab (<italic>n</italic> = 32) or irinotecan-based chemotherapy plus panitumumab every 3 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 26) were randomized to primary pre-emptive or reactive skin treatment. Patients randomized to the pre-emptive treatment arm received daily skin treatment from 24 hours before their first dose of panitumumab through week 6. Patients in the reactive treatment arm received treatment after development of skin toxicity. Skin toxicity treatment in the pre-emptive arm included skin moisturizer, sun-screen, 1% hydrocortisone cream, and doxycycline 100 mg twice daily. Treatment and timing of therapy initiation in the reactive arm were left to the discretion of the investigator. Recently presented results indicated that, as compared with reactive treatment, pre-emptive treatment reduced the incidence of grade 2 or greater skin toxicities by more than 50% without additional side effects. In addition, time to severe skin toxicity was significantly delayed in the pre-emptive treatment arm. The time to first occurrence of any grade 2 or greater skin toxicity was also significantly delayed in the preemptive arm.</p><p>Two randomized double-blind trials have examined the effects of prophylactic skin rash treatment. An 8-week trial studied prophylactic oral minocycline as compared with placebo for patients with m<sc>crc</sc> preparing to initiate cetuximab therapy. Patients were also randomized to receive topical tazarotene application to the left or right side of the face. At weeks 1&#x02013;4 of mAb treatment, the minocycline group (<italic>n</italic> = 24) had a significantly lower total facial lesion count and a significantly reduced incidence of moderate-to-severe itch as compared with the placebo group (<italic>n</italic> = 24, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05). Study authors also concluded that topical tazarotene was not recommended for the management of cetuximab-mediated rash because it provided no clinical benefit and was associated with significant skin irritation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-co16-1-16">34</xref>. In another double-blind trial, patients starting <sc>egfri</sc> therapy were randomized to tetracycline (500 mg twice daily) or to placebo for 4 weeks (<italic>n</italic> = 61). Although tetracycline did not prevent <sc>egfri</sc>-induced rash, a reduction in rash severity was observed. At week 4, grade 2 rash was reported in 17% of the tetracycline group and in 55% of the placebo group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04). Treatment also improved certain <sc>skindex</sc>-16 quality-of-life measures, including skin burning or stinging and skin irritation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-co16-1-16">35</xref>.</p><p>Additional well-controlled prospective clinical trials are needed to further examine the potential benefits of primary pre-emption of <sc>egfri</sc>-mediated skin toxicities, and to establish a framework for consistent evidence-based treatment approaches based on biologic mechanisms. In addition, further evaluation of patient, nursing, and physician education tools is important and may aid in the promotion of prophylactic intervention, early recognition, and best practices in skin toxicity management, thereby maximizing potential clinical benefit from the <sc>egfri</sc> class of agents, reducing the risk of serious infection, and improving patient quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>4.3 Rash-to-Survival Correlation</title><p>Available retrospective evidence suggests that the appearance and severity of skin rash is positively correlated with objective tumour response to <sc>egfri</sc> therapy and with <sc>os</sc> in m<sc>crc</sc>. Data suggest that skin rash may serve as a surrogate marker of <sc>egfr</sc>-targeted mAb efficacy. In several analyses, both the presence and intensity of skin toxicity predicted objective tumour response in patients treated with cetuximab or panitumumab in m<sc>crc</sc>. In patients receiving cetuximab monotherapy for refractory m<sc>crc</sc>, longer survival times were observed in patients with rash of any grade as compared with patients experiencing no rash (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-co16-1-16">37</xref>. In the pivotal phase <sc>ii</sc> trial of cetuximab in combination with irinotecan as compared with cetuximab alone in patients with m<sc>crc</sc>, response rates in patients with skin reaction were higher than rates in patients without skin reaction (25.8% vs. 6.3% in the combination group, 13.0% vs. 0% in the monotherapy group; <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-co16-1-16">6</xref>.</p><p>Similar results have been observed in phase <sc>ii</sc> and phase <sc>iii</sc> studies of panitumumab.

Note that these observations have yet to be validated by prospective trials, and it should not be assumed that <sc>egfr</sc>-targeted mAbs are ineffective in patients who do not develop rash.</p></sec><sec><title>4.4 Dose-to-Rash Studies</title><p>Retrospectively observed rash-to-survival correlations suggest that individualized dose titration based on the appearance and severity of skin rash may allow for optimization of <sc>egfri</sc> therapy and have led to the initiation of &#x0201c;dose-to-rash&#x0201d; trials (increasing the dosage until rash is observed) that are examining dose escalation protocols. The phase <sc>i</sc>/<sc>ii</sc> dose escalation trial in patients with m<sc>crc</sc> with no or slight skin reactions on standard-dose cetuximab treatment, also known as the <sc>everest</sc> trial, supports the rash-to-survival correlation, with prospective data demonstrating an increase in rash severity and response rate with escalating dose of cetuximab<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-co16-1-16">40</xref>. Patients with m<sc>crc</sc> with no or slight skin reactions after 22 days of standard cetuximab therapy were randomized to continue receiving a standard dose or to begin a dose escalation protocol that involved increasing the dose every 2 weeks until a grade 2 skin toxicity or a cetuximab dose of 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> was achieved. As compared with the standard-dose arm, the dose-escalation arm demonstrated an improvement in response rate (risk ratio: 30% vs. 13%). This finding supports the relationship between tumour response rate, <sc>egfri</sc> dose, and skin toxicity, thereby substantiating the correlation between <sc>egfri</sc> activity at the level of the <sc>egfr</sc> receptor on the skin and in the tumour.</p><p>Although the mechanism underlying the correlation between skin toxicity and tumour response is currently unclear, investigators have hypothesized that the rash may be a surrogate marker for degree of receptor saturation by the <sc>egfri</sc> agent. Accordingly, researchers have speculated that skin toxicity may aid in predicting which patients may preferentially or maximally benefit from <sc>egfri</sc> therapies. In addition, targeting doses to achieve a desired level of cutaneous toxicity may further increase the efficacy of <sc>egfri</sc>s. Ongoing and planned dose-to-rash studies will further evaluate the potential benefit of dose escalation for patients with m<sc>crc</sc> and no or mild skin toxicity from <sc>egfr</sc>-targeted mAbs. If these studies confirm a relationship between <sc>egfri</sc> dose and response rate, definitive studies using <sc>pfs</sc> as an endpoint will be justified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-co16-1-16">12</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>5.

SUMMARY</title><p>Skin rash is a predictable but manageable side effect of anti-<sc>egfr</sc> therapy, including therapy with the <sc>egfr</sc>-targeted mAbs cetuximab and panitumumab. A proactive, multidisciplinary approach to pre-emption and therapy of skin toxicities will help to limit the incidence of severe symptoms, improve patient tolerance of therapy, maximize quality of life, and optimize clinical benefits of <sc>egfr</sc>-targeted mAbs by minimizing the need for dose reduction or early treatment discontinuation. The Canadian treatment recommendations and algorithm presented in this article represent the current consensus-derived best practice for treatment of skin rash mediated by <sc>egfr</sc>-targeted mAbs in patients with m<sc>crc</sc>, and they are likely generalizable to other diseases being treated with these agents. Although well-designed prospective trials remain necessary to confirm best practices, educational tools such as this algorithm may serve to guide health care professionals and to inform patients with the goal of maximizing the benefits of <sc>egfri</sc> therapy. Establishing evidence-based approaches to the treatment of skin toxicities will become an even greater priority as the indications for these agents expand into earlier treatment and adjuvant settings for m<sc>crc</sc> and other tumour types.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>7.
