Overall results showed that the activity of antioxidant (MDA, SOD, GSH and CAT) in Se-adequate mice was significantly higher than that of Se-deficient mice following the infection of <italic>C.parvum</italic>. It is suggested that the relativity might exist between Se deficiency and infection of parasites. Ribeiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004628-Ribeiro1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> suggested a decrease in GSH levels in host might render them susceptible to <italic>schistosomula</italic>. It may explain the susceptibility of host to infection of <italic>C.parvum</italic> due to a decrease in GSH levels of Se deficient mice in this study. The roles of selenoenzymes, GPx, in the intracellular and extracellular antioxidant defense systems have been well characterized. GPx isoenzymes use GSH as a donor of reducing equivalents to detoxify H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, peroxi-derivatives of various organic compounds (e.g., fatty acids, cholesterol, and phospholipids) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004628-Arthur2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, and peroxynitrite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004628-Briviba1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, GPx is essential for maintenance of the cellular redox status and for the regulation of the redox-sensitive signaling and transcription mechanisms. Notably, although Se deficiency has been shown to suppress GPx expression and decrease the corresponding enzymatic activities, similar phenomenon was also observed from this study. Selenium deficiency could lead to enhanced lipid peroxidation through loss of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004628-Kautiainen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The level of infection achieved in Se-deficient and Se-adequate mice models was sufficient to generate a parasite-specific immune response as evidenced by the parasite-specific proliferative responses obtained following ex vivo re-stimulation of MLN cells.

In contrast, these weak proliferative responses might correlate with an unability to control this infection in Se-deficient mice. Thus, <italic>C. parvum</italic>-infected Se-deficient mice demonstrated heavy oocyst shedding, rapid weight loss, and dehydration within 28 days.
