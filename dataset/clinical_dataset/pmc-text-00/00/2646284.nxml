This heterogeneity makes prognostic and therapeutic decisions difficult, as tumors arising from the same tissue type may harbor activation of distinct oncogenic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As a consequence, tumors that are histologically similar may follow strikingly different clinical courses and respond differently to conventional and targeted therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Indeed, as molecularly targeted therapies increasingly enter the clinic, identifying the spectrum of oncogenic pathways activated within a given tumor will become even more critical for selecting effective therapeutic approaches.</p><p>Currently, the clinical detection of oncogenic pathway activation is most commonly performed using methods that analyze pathway activation at the protein level, such as immunohistochemistry to detect oncogene overexpression, or at the DNA level to detect oncogene amplification, with techniques such as fluorescence <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (FISH) and quantitative PCR. For example, expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and estrogen receptor are routinely assessed to guide treatment selection in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Unfortunately, many commonly activated oncogenic pathways do not lend themselves to this type of analysis. This is, in part, due to the fact that most pathways can be activated at multiple points in the pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], thereby complicating attempts to assess a pathway's overall activation status. Consequently, a more robust and generalizable method for detecting oncogenic pathway activation in tumors would be valuable.</p><p>To date, a number of methods have been developed to infer pathway activation from gene expression data. These approaches have the advantage of being applicable to multiple pathways simultaneously and of requiring only one technological modality. For example, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) has been used to detect pathway activation by comparing the extent of enrichment of a signature for a given pathway between two groups of samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Using this approach, Sweet-Cordero <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] detected a K-Ras expression signature in human lung adenocarcinomas bearing K-Ras mutations.</p><p>However, GSEA has several limitations. First, it cannot provide a quantitative measure of pathway activation. More importantly, since GSEA relies on a comparison between two groups, it cannot be used to identify the state of pathway activation for individual samples. This represents a major limitation, since separating a sample set into two groups for the purposes of comparison requires prior knowledge of some relevant feature of the samples. Consequently, GSEA is most useful for identifying pathways that are enriched in samples with a known clinical parameter, such as a particular tumor subtype. In contrast, GSEA is not well suited for identifying or comparing pathway activity levels within a group of samples. Other enrichment analysis methods, such as gene set analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], share these shortcomings.</p><p>An alternative approach to detecting pathway activation is singular value decomposition-based Bayesian binary regression (SVD regression) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In this approach, the gene expression patterns of two training sample sets (for example, pathway 'on' and pathway 'off') are compared and differentially regulated genes are linearly combined into principal components, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the feature space. Binary regression on the principal components is then applied to an unknown test sample, resulting in a probability score describing the likelihood of pathway activation in that sample. This approach has several advantages. First, the output is, at least in theory, a quantitative measure of pathway activity. Furthermore, SVD regression can be applied to a single sample and does not require dividing the testing samples into two groups based upon <italic>a priori </italic>knowledge. Finally, the use of reduced-dimension features and orthogonal components reduces problems involving co-linearity during regression analysis. For these reasons, SVD regression holds promise as a mathematical tool for predicting pathway activity.</p><p>To date, SVD regression has been used to detect activation of dominant oncogenic signaling pathways, such as Myc or Ras, in MMTV-Myc and MMTV-Ras driven mouse breast cancer models, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In these contexts, SVD regression was shown to be capable of detecting activation of the pathway that was experimentally perturbed. While such experiments provided proof-of-principle that SVD regression can detect pathway activation, the critical question of whether SVD regression is sensitive enough to detect activation of endogenous pathways has not been fully addressed.</p><p>SVD regression has also been used to predict pathway activity in human samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. For example, Bild <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] were able to predict the activation status of five distinct oncogenic pathways (Myc, Ras, E2F, Src, and &#x003b2;-catenin) in primary lung cancers and to correlate these activities with patient survival. Unfortunately, validation of the sensitivity and specificity of this approach is limited by the difficulty in confirming predictions made on human samples, as material for biochemical analysis is often unavailable. Thus, the accuracy of predictions made using SVD regression in these studies remains undetermined.</p><p>We reasoned that SVD regression might be a powerful means of detecting endogenous pathway activation, allowing for the discovery of new biological relationships between signaling pathways. To evaluate this possibility, we addressed whether SVD regression is sufficiently sensitive to detect secondary activation of an endogenous pathway in a model amenable to experimental manipulation and validation. Specifically, we focused on the relationship between the Ras and transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#x003b2;) signaling pathways. Although a number of studies have documented crosstalk between these pathways, a coherent model explaining their interaction has remained elusive, and there exists no consensus on the direction or underlying mechanism of this crosstalk, nor on how these pathways interact during epithelial cell transformation.</p><p>In non-transformed cells, the Ras and TGF&#x003b2; pathways exert largely antagonistic effects: Ras can inhibit TGF&#x003b2;-induced growth suppression by inhibiting Smad nuclear translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], while TGF&#x003b2; can potently inhibit cell proliferation induced by mitogenic factors, such as epidermal growth factor, that signal through Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In contrast, Ras and TGF&#x003b2; appear to cooperate in transformed cells to promote aspects of tumor progression, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As such, crosstalk between the Ras and TGF&#x003b2; pathways is complex, may occur at multiple nodes within each pathway, and is likely to be dependent upon cellular context.</p><p>To detect crosstalk between the Ras and TGF&#x003b2; pathways using computational approaches, we generated gene expression signatures that allow for the quantitative prediction of TGF&#x003b2; and Ras pathway activity using SVD regression. Using these signatures, we demonstrate that acute induction of oncogenic Ras in the mouse mammary gland results in rapid activation of the TGF&#x003b2; pathway. Conversely, application of SVD regression using a Ras pathway signature revealed rapid Ras pathway activation following TGF&#x003b2; treatment of normal mammary epithelial cells. Biochemical studies confirmed these computational findings, supporting the specificity of these SVD regression-based predictions. Taken together, our results indicate that SVD regression can detect activation of endogenous pathways <italic>in vivo</italic>, thereby providing novel insight into cell signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of a TGF&#x003b2; pathway signature using SVD regression</title><p>To generate a gene expression signature for the TGF&#x003b2; signaling pathway in mammary epithelial cells, we used a non-transformed murine mammary epithelial cell line (NMuMG). NMuMG cells respond to TGF&#x003b2; by undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and have commonly been used to study signaling and transcriptional events downstream of this cytokine. To identify a comprehensive list of genes altered by TGF-&#x003b2;1 treatment, Affymetrix microarray analysis was performed on untreated NMuMG cells and cells treated with TGF&#x003b2; for 24 h. SVD regression with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting generated a TGF-&#x003b2;1 signature consisting of 500 genes. Among the genes present in this signature were several known TGF&#x003b2; targets, including <italic>Serpine1</italic>/<italic>plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 </italic>(<italic>PAI-1</italic>), <italic>connective tissue growth factor </italic>(<italic>Ctgf</italic>), <italic>Bhlhb2</italic>, <italic>cysteine rich protein 61</italic>(<italic>Cyr61</italic>) and <italic>interleukin-11</italic>(<italic>IL-11</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>We next wished to compare the transcriptional changes induced by TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;3. NMuMG cells were treated with TGF-&#x003b2;3 for 24 h, Affymetrix microarray analysis was performed, and a TGF-&#x003b2;3 signature was extracted in a manner analogous to that used for TGF-&#x003b2;1. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the TGF-&#x003b2;1 signature revealed that 97.7% of the gene expression variation could be represented in principal component 1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). When the TGF-&#x003b2;3 signature was projected in the PCA plot onto the space delineated by the TGF-&#x003b2;1 signature, TGF-&#x003b2;3-treated samples fell closer to TGF-&#x003b2;1 treated samples than to untreated NMuMG cells, indicating that TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 elicit similar transcriptional changes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>An NMuMG-derived TGF&#x003b2; signature accurately and quantitatively predicts TGF&#x003b2; pathway activation</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Principal component analysis (PCA) of untreated NMuMG cells (open circles), TGF-&#x003b2;1 treated cells (training set, filled squares), and TGF-&#x003b2;3 treated cells (testing set, filled circles). <bold>(b) </bold>SVD regression demonstrating quantitative prediction of TGF&#x003b2; pathway activity in both TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 treated cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2008-9-12-r180-1"/></fig><p>To further compare the transcriptional changes induced by TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;3, the extent of overlap between genes differentially regulated by these cytokines was assessed. Treatment with TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 led to changes in 1,316 and 880 probes, respectively, with a minimum threshold of a 1.5-fold change and a <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.01. There were 757 differentially regulated genes common to these two treatments (<italic>p </italic>= 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-107</sup>, hypergeometric test), indicating again that TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 induce very similar transcriptional programs. Since substantial overlap was identified between the TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 transcriptional responses, we used the 500-gene TGF-&#x003b2;1 signature as the TGF&#x003b2; pathway signature for all subsequent experiments and the TGF-&#x003b2;3 dataset was used as an independent testing dataset (Additional data file 1).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative estimation of TGF&#x003b2; pathway activity in TGF&#x003b2;-treated mammary epithelial cells using SVD regression</title><p>While PCA permits untreated and TGF&#x003b2;-treated samples to be distinguished, it would be useful to have a quantitative measure of TGF&#x003b2; pathway activity in a given sample. Given the limited sensitivity and specificity of microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], this requires combining multiple probe sets and reducing the dimensionality of data to construct a stable predictor with limited training data.</p><p>Toward this end, SVD binary regression with MCMC fitting was applied to obtain a quantitative measurement of TGF&#x003b2; pathway activity. First, the TGF&#x003b2; pathway predictor was trained by comparing TGF-&#x003b2;1 treated and untreated cells. The predictor was then tested on TGF-&#x003b2;3 treated cells. Using leave-one-out cross-validation to assess out-of-sample-error, the predictor was able to detect TGF&#x003b2; pathway activity in both the training (TGF&#x003b2;-1) and the testing (TGF&#x003b2;-3) sets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Thus, this model appears to provide a sensitive and accurate measure of TGF&#x003b2; activity.</p></sec><sec><title>PCA identifies TGF&#x003b2; pathway activation following short-term Ras induction</title><p>Given the complex relationship between the Ras and TGF&#x003b2; pathways during epithelial cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], we sought to determine the status of the TGF&#x003b2; pathway following Ras activation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We previously described the generation of TetO-Ras (TRAS) mice in which expression of an activated oncogenic Ras allele (<italic>Hras</italic><sup><italic>G12V</italic></sup>) is under the control of the tetracycline operator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. <italic>TRAS </italic>mice were mated to MMTV-rtTA (MTB) transgenic mice that express the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) under the control of the MMTV promoter. In the resulting bitransgenic MTB/TRAS mice, doxycycline treatment leads to oncogenic Ras expression in the mammary epithelium, resulting in the acute activation of pathways downstream of Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>To examine the relationship between Ras activation and TGF&#x003b2; pathway activity, we used microarray expression profiling and SVD regression to assess TGF&#x003b2; pathway activity in the mammary glands of MTB/TRAS mice following doxycycline treatment. MTB/TRAS mice were treated with doxycycline for 24 h, 48 h, 96 h, 8 days or 14 days, and RNA was harvested from mammary glands for global gene expression analysis using Affymetrix microarrays. When mammary gland samples were projected onto the expression space delineated by the TGF&#x003b2; signature, as defined in NMuMG cells, mammary samples in which Ras was acutely induced spanned the region between untreated and TGF&#x003b2;-treated NMuMG cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Mammary gland samples from uninduced MTB/TRAS mice were most similar to untreated NMuMG cells, whereas mammary gland samples from 14-day induced MTB/TRAS mice were most similar to TGF&#x003b2;-treated NMuMG cells. The magnitude of TGF&#x003b2; activation predicted based upon the TGF&#x003b2; signature increased with increasing duration of Ras activation. These results indicate that Ras activation in the mammary gland results in gene expression changes similar to those induced by TGF&#x003b2; in mammary epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.

To achieve this, the SVD predictor was used to estimate TGF&#x003b2; activity at increasing times following Ras induction. This analysis revealed a time-dependent increase in predicted TGF&#x003b2; activity in the mammary gland following Ras activation. An increased probability of TGF&#x003b2; pathway activity was observed as early as 24-48 h following Ras activation. Increased TGF&#x003b2; pathway activity reached statistical significance at 96 h post-Ras-induction and remained elevated through 14 days of Ras activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>).

First, Ras and TGF&#x003b2; might initiate similar gene expression programs through distinct transcriptional mediators. Alternatively, Ras might lead to activation of regulatory molecules downstream of TGF&#x003b2;, such as those of the Smad transcription factor family. Similarly, TGF&#x003b2; might activate effector molecules downstream of Ras, such as Raf, MEK, and MAPK. To evaluate these possibilities at the biochemical level, we examined the Smad family of transcription factors as well as the Raf-MEK-MAPK pathway as critical mediators of TGF&#x003b2; and Ras-induced signaling, respectively.</p><p>To determine whether the activation of the TGF&#x003b2; pathway that we detected computationally following short-term Ras induction in the mammary gland was due to activation of Smad transcription factors, we performed immunofluorescence on mammary gland sections to examine the subcellular localization of Smad4. This analysis revealed that 96 h of Ras activation in the mammary gland was sufficient to induce nuclear translocation of Smad4, confirming activation of this pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). We next examined Smad3 phosphorylation following Ras activation. Consistent with our prediction that Ras activates this pathway, we found that acute induction of activated Ras led to a marked increase in levels of phosphorylated Smad3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b,c</xref>). Thus, short-term Ras activation directly induces Smad activation <italic>in vivo</italic>, which in turn results in the induction of a TGF&#x003b2; transcriptional response.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Ras and TGF&#x003b2; exhibit positive reciprocal regulation in mammary epithelial cells</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Immunofluorescence showing Smad4 nuclear translocation following short-term Ras expression in the mammary gland.

For SVD regression to be of broad utility, however, it must also accurately predict pathway activation in a complex system, such as a tumor. Chronic Ras activation in the mammary gland leads to the formation of adenocarcinomas with a latency of 14 weeks. Given our finding that short-term Ras activation in the mammary gland results in TGF&#x003b2; pathway activation, we next sought to assess whether activation of the TGF&#x003b2; pathway is also detectable in Ras-induced tumors. To address this, global gene expression profiles of Ras-induced tumors were assessed by Affymetrix microarray analysis, and the above SVD predictor was used to predict their TGF&#x003b2; pathway activity. This analysis reveals that the TGF&#x003b2; pathway is indeed activated in Ras-induced tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>), suggesting that this putative tumor suppressor TGF&#x003b2; pathway is not shut off during the course of Ras-induce tumorigenesis.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>A TGF&#x003b2; signature detects TGF&#x003b2; pathway activation in Ras-induced mammary tumors</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>SVD regression predicts TGF&#x003b2; pathway activation in mammary glands expressing activated Ras for 96 h and in mammary tumors induced by chronic Ras activation. <bold>(b) </bold>Western analysis showing increased phosphorylation of Smad1/3 in Ras-induced mammary tumors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2008-9-12-r180-6"/></fig><p>We next used biochemical approaches to test our computational prediction that the TGF&#x003b2; pathway is activated in Ras-induced tumors.

This indicates that SVD can detect signaling pathway activation within a complex system.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The ability to detect activation of an oncogenic pathway based upon patterns of gene expression would constitute a useful tool to query tumor biology and aid in prognostic and therapeutic decision-making in cancer patients. Herein we describe the use of SVD regression to accurately detect endogenous pathway activity <italic>in vivo </italic>in the context of a strong primary oncogenic stimulus. Using an inducible transgenic model expressing oncogenic Ras in the mammary gland, we have demonstrated that a TGF&#x003b2; transcriptional signature is induced following short-term Ras activation and remains elevated during a 2-week course of Ras induction in the mammary gland. We have further demonstrated that this signature can be attributed to Ras-induced activation of Smad transcription factors, which provides a mechanistic basis for our computational prediction. Finally, we have demonstrated that TGF&#x003b2; treatment of NMuMG cells results in the rapid induction of a Ras pathway signature. Consistent with these computational predictions, biochemical studies revealed that TGF&#x003b2; treatment resulted in MEK activation and increased levels of Ras-GTP, suggesting that induction of the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway is responsible for induction of the observed Ras signature following TGF&#x003b2; treatment.</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest a model in which Ras and TGF&#x003b2; induce reciprocal positive crosstalk in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells. Since TGF&#x003b2; has been shown to inhibit epithelial cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], our finding that TGF&#x003b2; activity is increased following activated Ras expression in the mammary gland was unexpected, given that Ras induces widespread hyperplasia in the mammary gland at the time points tested and ultimately leads to tumor formation. However, these results are consistent with reports that Ras and TGF&#x003b2; can synergize in promoting some aspects of the malignant phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Our findings provide important confirmation of this hypothesis in an <italic>in vivo </italic>model for mammary tumorigenesis and suggest that, at least in the context of Ras activation, the TGF&#x003b2; pathway could potentially contribute to early stages of transformation.</p><p>Using gene expression patterns to predict pathway activity has several advantages over traditional biochemical methods. Such signatures are based upon downstream transcriptional targets of a pathway, and so function as an overall measure of pathway activity. In contrast, biochemical approaches generally focus on one or several nodes in a pathway. Consequently, these approaches risk missing pathway activation that occurs at other points in the pathway, or that results from subtle, coordinated changes in multiple pathway members. While computational prediction of pathway activity does not address the mechanism by which a given pathway is activated, it does generate testable predictions for subsequent experiments.</p><p>Although linear regression is a popular tool in prediction, we did not use it here to predict pathway activity for two reasons. First, our training dataset only has two states, pathway 'on' and 'off', and linear regression is not suitable in such cases. Second, the number of training samples is much smaller than the number of signature genes, a problem known as the 'curse of dimensionality' in statistical learning. This makes estimation of the linear regression coefficient unstable. To circumvent this problem, SVD has been used for dimensionality reduction. For instance, SVD has been used to reduce the dimensionality of expression data and integrate ChIP-chip data with expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It has also been employed to reduce the expression data dimension prior to classifier training using support vector machines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Although each of these approaches used SVD to reduce dimensionality, the objectives of these studies were distinct from those of this study, which focused on using expression data to predict signaling pathway activity.</p><p>Until recently, SVD binary regression has primarily been used to detect the activity of ectopically activated dominant oncogenic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Whether it can also be used to detect endogenously occurring activation of a secondary pathway had not previously been assessed. We were able to detect TGF&#x003b2; pathway activity in the context of concurrent, strong Ras pathway activation, and vice versa. Our findings, which were unexpected, indicate that SVD regression can detect crosstalk between endogenous signaling pathways and may be useful for identifying previously unsuspected relationships between signaling pathways. Furthermore, our results provide an important proof-of-principle that SVD regression is sufficiently sensitive for this purpose, which is essential for the utility of this technique in predicting pathway activity in human cancers.</p><p>When analyzing gene expression data from human tumor samples, lack of materials frequently renders biochemical validation impossible. As such, validating signatures in experimentally tractable systems is valuable. To this end, in the study presented here we were able to validate our computational predictions with biochemical approaches. Given that tumors typically result from the collaboration between multiple signaling pathways, the ability to detect the activation status of individual pathways within a complex network of other pathways in the cell is of paramount importance. In this manner, it should be possible to classify tumors according to the molecular pathways that have been activated, thereby leading to improvements in the selection of appropriate treatments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Inducible transgenic mice and cell culture</title><p>MTB and TRAS transgenic mice have previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].
