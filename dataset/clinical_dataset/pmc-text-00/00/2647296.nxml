According to the present knowledge, sRNAs are generally divided into several categories, including microRNAs (miRNAs), short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), <italic>trans</italic>-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs; 4), natural antisense transcript siRNAs (nat-siRNAs; 5) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In plants, ta-siRNAs and nat-siRNAs guide the cleavage of target mRNAs, whereas heterochromatic siRNAs are involved in DNA and histone modification, leading to the silencing of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In addition to nat-siRNAs, rice natural antisense miRNAs (nat-miRNAs) were recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>miRNAs (&#x0223c;21 nt) are produced from noncoding imperfectly complementary, stem&#x02013;loop RNA precursors. The miRNA genes can be transcribed by RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) to form the primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). In higher plants, pri-miRNAs are processed by dicer-like 1 (DCL1; 10) or DCL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) to form miRNA duplexes through multiple cleavage steps, and then miRNA duplexes are methylated by Hua Enhancer1 (HEN1) at the 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and loaded onto Argonaute 1 (AGO1) where the mature miRNAs guide the cleavage of target mRNAs. In the meanwhile, the passenger strands (referred as miRNA*s) are gradually degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Although the first miRNA (<italic>lin-4</italic>) was discovered by forward genetic screening in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), the majority of currently known plant miRNAs were identified by size-selected cloning and sequencing, especially those in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18">15&#x02013;18</xref>) and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). Recently developed high-throughput sequencing strategies have expanded the depth of sRNA cloning coverage. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, analysis through massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) identified 67 528 and 27 833 unique 17-nt sequences from inflorescences and seedlings, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). More than 340 000 unique sRNAs from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings, rosette leaves, flowers and siliques were sequenced using pyrophosphate-based high-throughput sequencing technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and 48 new miRNAs were identified with similar strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In rice, &#x0223c;20 miRNAs were identified by large-scale sequencing of sRNAs in panicles, seedlings and stems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>).</p><p>Several guidelines have been proposed for miRNAs annotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The miRNA precursors should contain stable and conserved stem&#x02013;loop structures that can be predicted by Mfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), and mature miRNAs should be detected by northern blotting or sequencing. In addition, as miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, capped and polyadenylated as normal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), EST analysis is a powerful approach to identify the new miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Identification of a miRNA* sequence, a product of Dicer cleavage corresponding to miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), also strongly indicates that the corresponding sRNA molecule was indeed processed by Dicer-like RNase III enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>Rice is an important food resource for human daily life and serves as model species of monocotyledon plants. Development and maturation of rice seed, a highly specialized organ of nutrient storage and reproductive development, involve meticulous and fine gene regulations at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). To further study the complicated regulatory network of rice seed development, and to elucidate the functions of sRNAs during this process, MPSS and integrated bioinformatics analysis were performed, resulting in the identification of novel and candidate miRNAs. Further, expression profiles of miRNAs were analyzed through miRNA microarray hybridization, which have been widely used to study the miRNA expression levels in several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34 B35">32&#x02013;35</xref>). Comparison of expression patterns revealed the positive or negative correlations between miRNAs and the corresponding target genes, which greatly expand the understanding of how miRNAs were involved in rice seed development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>cDNA library construction and MPSS analysis</title><p>Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, japonica cultivar Zhonghua 11) immature seeds at 3, 6, 9 and 12 days after anthesis (DAA) were collected and total RNAs were extracted separately using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogene, Nottingham, UK), which were then mixed with equal amounts from individual samples. After separation on denatured polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), the fraction of 18&#x02013;26-nt small RNAs (sRNAs) was recovered by sRNAs gel extraction Kit (TaKaRa Bio, Otsu, Japan).</p><p>The cDNA library construction and MPSS analysis were carried out by TaKaRa Bio Inc. (Otsu, Japan) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In brief, 20 ng of sRNAs fraction was dephosphorylated and ligated with RNA&#x02013;DNA chimeric 3&#x02032;-adapter. After purification by denatured PAGE, the RNA fraction with attached adapters was phosphorylated and ligated with RNA&#x02013;DNA chimeric 5&#x02032;-adapter. Resultant products were reversely transcribed and amplified by PCR with primers (with a SfaNI site). Then the amplified PCR products were digested by SfaNI and cloned into the Tag vector pMBS I (Solexa). The resultant library, which has more than 1.3 million total complexity, was amplified and loaded onto microbeads. Finally, more than 1 million microbeads were loaded into each flowcell and the signature sequences of 22 bases were determined by a series of enzymatic reactions.</p><p>The adaptor sequences of signatures were masked. After removing signatures corresponding to ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), the total abundances of signatures were around 250 000. sRNAs were normalized to transcripts per quarter million (TPQ) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The signatures and abundances of sRNAs in rice seed library can be found in National Center for Biotechnology Information, Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI, GEO) under series number GSE11974.</p></sec><sec><title>Data sets</title><p>Genome sequences and annotations of rice (version 5.0) and assembled <italic>Zea mays</italic> sequence (AZM5) were obtained from TIGR (the Institute for Genomic Research). Sequences of rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs and snoRNAs were downloaded from databases including the European ribosomal RNA database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.psb.ugent.be/rRNA/">http://www.psb.ugent.be/rRNA/</ext-link>, for rRNA), the Genomic tRNA database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb/,">http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb/,</ext-link> for tRNA) and NONCODE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinfo.org.cn/NONCODE/">http://www.bioinfo.org.cn/NONCODE/</ext-link>, for snRNAs and snoRNAs). Mature miRNAs and annoated stem&#x02013;loop sequences were obtained from miRBase (versions 10.0 and 11.0, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/">http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/</ext-link>; 37). sRNAs sequences of rice, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> were downloaded from rice MPSS database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mpss.udel.edu/rice/">http://mpss.udel.edu/rice/</ext-link>), <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Small RNA Project (ASRP, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://asrp.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/">http://asrp.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/</ext-link>) and GenBank data libraries (GEO accession number GSE5990, sample GSM139137), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of sRNA clusters and hotspots</title><p>The sRNAs were grouped into clusters dependent on their locations on the genome as described previously, i.e. sRNAs within 500 bp of each other were fallen under a cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). To identify the sRNA hotspots, abundance of each signature was firstly normalized by hitting times of signature on the genome, and then the sums of abundances of all signatures in no overlapping 500-bp windows were calculated. The top-ranking windows were used as seeds for extension in both directions until a window hits no signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Predictions of miRNAs and corresponding mRNA targets</title><p>All the known rice miRNAs, whose precursors contain no repetitive sequences, matched genome for &#x0003c;30 times. Our analysis on the obtained signatures that matched genome for more than 30 times indicated that 72.9% of them (3470 out of 4760) originated from repetitive sequences (TIGR Oryza Repeat Database v3.3). Signatures matched genome for more than 30 times were thus filtered out during miRNA prediction and those corresponding to rRNAs, tRNA, snRNAs and snoRNAs were eliminated. The 400-bp genome sequences on each side of these signatures were extracted and a sliding window of 450 bp with an increment of five bases was scanned along the extracted sequences. All the fragment sequences containing each signature were folded with the help of MFOLD3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Structures of the sequences with minimum energy were further analyzed using a Perl script to check whether these structures satisfy the criteria for majority of known plant miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The sequences of candidate precursors were analyzed using RepeatMasker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org">http://www.repeatmasker.org</ext-link>) to eliminate the repetitive sequences. Finally, signatures whose predicted secondary structures passed the <italic>in silico</italic> check were grouped by genomic positions. The candidates with miRNA* and/or EST supporting evidences were identified as miRNAs.</p><p>To predict the target sites of miRNAs, FASTA Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) was used to search the rice cDNA database (TIGR, version 5.0) with +15/&#x02013;10 scoring matrix. Obtained reverse complement results (maximal 100 000) of each miRNA were used to calculate the mispair scores and Minimum Free Energy (MFE) ratios. In brief, the MFE (&#x00394;G<sub>MFE</sub>) of a hypothetical duplex containing miRNA target paired with a perfectly complementary sequence and free energy of each actual miRNA-predicted target duplex (&#x00394;G<sub>target</sub>) were determined respectively. MFE ratio was calculated as &#x00394;G<sub>target</sub>/&#x00394;G<sub>MFE</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The mispair score and MFE ratio tolerance limits to &#x02264;4 and &#x02265;0.73 were assigned, and the match up of all miRNAs and predicted targets were checked manually. All the Perl scripts used in miRNA prediction and target prediction were available upon request.</p></sec><sec><title>miRNA chip generation and hybridization</title><p>The miRNAs in miRBase vesion 8.0, newly identified ones and other candidates in this study, were collected to design the probes. Independent sequences (polyT<sub>18</sub> or polyT<sub>19</sub>) were attached to the full-length miRNA probes at 3&#x02032;-end to acquire the final 40-nt probes so that they have appropriate extension space at the chip surface. The probes were then attached to the activated slide surface via a C6 5&#x02032;-amino-modifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Probes for tRNA and U6 RNA were designed and used as internal positive controls. In addition, eight DNA sequences having no homology with any sRNAs were designed and used as external positive controls. All probes were synthesized at MWG Company (Ebersberg, Germany), and dissolved into DNA spotting solution (40 &#x000b5;mol/l), which was spotted onto aldehyde-decorated slides for three repeated dots.</p><p>Labeling of sRNAs and chip hybridization were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In detail, 50&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g of total RNAs from different samples (embryo, endosperm, leaf and root of 7-day-old seedlings, 10-day-old seedling) were size-fractionated using Ambion's miRNA Isolation Kit (Cat#.1560) and labeled with T4 polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). RNA was dissolved in hybridization buffer containing 15% formamide, 0.2% SDS, 3&#x000d7;SSC and 50&#x000d7; Denhardt's solution. After overnight hybridization at 42&#x000b0;C, slides were washed in 0.2% SDS, 2&#x000d7;SSC for 4 min and 0.2&#x000d7;SSC for another 4 min. Hybridized slides were scanned with CapitalBio&#x000ae; LuxScan&#x02122; 10K/A (Beijing, China) and analyzed with the GenePix Pro 4.0 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The maximal signal level of background probes was 200, and 800 was set as detection signal threshold of miRNAs.</p><p>Hybridization signals were normalized using medium center method. For each tissue (except embryo) two hybridizations were performed, thus six hybridization signals were finally obtained for each miRNA from one tissue (three signals for embryo). As the immature embryo tissues were difficult to collect and considering that there were three repeat dots of probes on the chip, only one hybridization was performed. At last, mean of hybridization signals was calculated and visualized using TIGR Mev (version 3.1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tm4.org/mev.html">http://www.tm4.org/mev.html</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Gene expression analysis through microarray hybridization</title><p>GeneChip&#x000ae; rice genome array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used for DNA microarray analysis. The RNA samples were same as those for miRNA microarray hybridization (total RNAs were fractioned, the fraction containing large or small RNA molecules were used for DNA and miRNA microarray analysis, respectively). Each sample has two biological repeats, and 10-&#x003bc;g cRNA was used in each hybridization. Washing, staining and scanning of chips were performed according to supplier's protocol. Hybridization signals were normalized using the Affymetrix Microarray Suit program (version 5.0) and visualized using TIGR Mev. The microarray data of Affymetrix arrays are under series number GSE11966 in the database of NCBI, GEO. To check the replicate quality of microarray, least-square linear regression for each tissue was carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) (Table S1).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression analysis of mature miRNAs through quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR)</title><p>Total RNAs were isolated from various tissues (same as those used in miRNA microarray hybridizations), treated with RNase-free DNaseI (MBI Fermentas, Lithuania), and then polyadenylated (2 &#x003bc;g) by poly(A) polymerase (NEB, USA) at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h in a 20-&#x003bc;l reaction mixture. After phenol&#x02013;chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the RNAs were dissolved and reversely transcribed using poly(T) adapter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). qPCR was performed using SYBR&#x000ae; Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Japan) and all the primers used were listed in Table S2. The values of threshold cycle (<italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub>, the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold), were calculated by Rotor-Gene 6 software (Corbett Robotics, Australia). <italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub> values were converted into relative copy numbers using a standard curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). As reference gene, 5.8S rRNA was used in qPCR detection of miRNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). To check whether rice 5.8S rRNA is suitable, we firstly surveyed the expression level of 5.8S rRNA and some other suggested reference genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) in GeneChip&#x000ae; rice genome array, and the results showed that the expression levels of these genes were relative stable (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn998/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1A</ext-link>). Further, expression level of 5.8S rRNA was characterized by qPCR using rice Actin gene (Os03g50890) as reference gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), and results confirmed the stable expression of 5.8S rRNA in the samples used in the study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn998/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1B</ext-link>). These indicated that it is suitable using rice 5.8S rRNA to normalize the qPCR data.</p><p>In addition, reaction efficiencies of qPCR assays for individual miRNAs were determined using Rotor-Gene 6 software. A 10-fold dilution series of purified product of the tested miRNA (or guide genes) were used as the template for qPCR to generate a plot of Log copy numbers of the tested miRNA (or guide genes) versus the corresponding <italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub> as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The slope of the linear plot is defined as &#x02013;(1/log (<italic>E</italic> + 1), where <italic>E</italic> is the reaction efficiency. In Rotor-Gene 6 software, reaction efficiency, whose optimal value is 1, is defined as amplification value &#x02013;1. The results showed that the reaction efficiency of tested miRNAs approach the optimal value (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn998/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis</title><p>Precursor sequences of miR169 and miR396 families were aligned with ClustalW (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2</ext-link>; 44), and the conserved fragments were visualized with the help of GeneDoc program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc">http://www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc</ext-link>).

This may because rice genome contains many interspersed and inverted repeat sequences, which produce abundant siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Additionally, 15.6% of the distinct sRNAs match protein-coding genes in sense and/or antisense orientation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), and the corresponding encoded proteins involve in various molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components, suggesting the complexity of sRNAs&#x02019; origin (Table S4).</p><p>In addition, 70.7% of the genome-matching sRNAs locate on genome only once (the location numbers account for 4.5% of the total locations), while &#x0223c;3% sRNAs match the genome for more than 100 times (Table S5). Characterization of the distribution of sRNAs, protein-encoding genes and repetitive sequences on chromosome shows that some loci have high propensity to produce sRNAs, and these sRNA hotspots originated preferentially from the regions other than centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn998/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Most sRNAs in rice seeds originated from transposable elements</title><p>A total of 81 530 sRNA clusters were identified depending on the distance between every two signatures, and 72 173 of them contain interspersed repeats (annotated by RepeatMasker, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org">http://www.repeatmasker.org</ext-link>; Table S6), 2967 were marked as tandem repeats (by Tandem repeats finder; 48), indicating that repeat-associated siRNAs (rasiRNAs) take up a large portion of sRNAs. The presence of highly abundant rasiRNAs in seeds is consistent with their roles in regulating transposon activity during seed development. Further identification of the top 50 hotspots, according to the normalized abundances of sRNAs, showed that tandem repeat loci inclined to generate sRNAs at high abundance. Nineteen of the top 50 hotspots contain tandem repeats, while only 3.6% of the total sRNA clusters were tandem repeats. This supported the generation mechanism of sRNAs from tandem repeats, proposed by Martienssen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). In addition, some miRNAs including osa-MIR168a, osa-MIR172b, and osa-MIR159a were also found with high abundance in sRNAs hotspots (Table S7).</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of registered miRNAs using sRNA signatures</title><p>One of the most critical criteria for miRNA annotation is that the miRNA should originate from a single-strand RNA transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However, some miRNA precursor sequences of registered miRNAs matched the short signatures in both sense and antisense orientations when the sRNAs sequences were mapped onto the precursor sequences (version 11.0), suggesting that they might not be <italic>bona fide</italic> miRNAs. In addition, most loci of these miRNAs appear to be repetitive sequences. Among the 269 miRNA loci, 91 precursors were annotated as transposable element repetitive sequences, and most of them were miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs, Table S8; 50).</p><p>sRNAs that match miRNA precursors can be grouped into several classes (Table S9). For <italic>bona fide</italic> miRNAs, most of the sRNAs should originate from the positions of mature miRNAs or miRNA*s at sense orientation. Our analysis on the sRNAs sequences from rice seeds (present study), flowers, seedlings and stems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) showed that the repetitive sequences-containing miRNA loci were different from those without repetitive sequences in at least two aspects. First, the antisense sRNAs generated from the miRNA loci containing repetitive sequences were comparable to sense sRNAs; second, many sRNAs from these loci were generated from the sites other than mature miRNAs or miRNA*s (Table S9). This indicated that the annotated repetitive sequences-containing miRNA loci might be either sRNA clusters producing sRNAs randomly from two strands, or borderline miRNA candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). It is worthy to notice that three miRNAs (osa-MIR531, osa-MIR1426 and osa-MIR1431), which generated sRNAs only from the mature miRNA positions, were also annotated as repetitive sequences (Table S9). Therefore, during the miRNA annotation in the present study, all the sequences containing repetitive sequences or putative precursors matching sRNAs in two orientations at similar abundance were excluded.</p><p>Two annotated miRNA loci, osa-MIR169p and osa-MIR169q, were significantly different from others (Table S9), as they generated many sRNAs in antisense orientation from the sites of mature miRNA and miRNA*. Among the generated sRNAs, some are uniquely mapped on the genome, indicating these two miRNAs may be transcribed from the antisense orientation of the annotated miRNA loci. Alignment on the precursor sequences of all osa-miR169 family members and the reversely complemented sequences of osa-MIR169p and osa-MIR169q showed that the reversely complemented sequences of osa-MIR169p and osa-MIR169q were conserved with osa-MIR169a-o (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). This indicated that directions of osa-MIR169p and osa-MIR169q might be mis-annotated in miRBase (version 11.0).<fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Small RNAs match miRNA precursors.

Annotated precursor sequences of osa-miR169 family, together with reverse-complemented sequences of osa-MIR169p and osa-MIR169q, were aligned. osa-MIR169p_a and osa-MIR169q_a indicated the reverse complemented sequences of osa-MIR169p and osa-MIR169q. ClustalW and GeneDoc were used for sequences alignment and visualizing the conserved fragments. Black, dark gray and light gray shading indicated that the nucleotides were conserved in all, more than 80% (&#x0003c;100%), or more than 60% (&#x0003c;80%), of the sequences, respectively (same for C).

In addition, detection of miRNA*s and rare side products of miRNA loci will help to confirm the expression of unique locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Through mapping the signatures obtained from seeds and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) onto the miRNA precursors, 96 loci from 47 miRNA families were confirmed using signatures uniquely hitting on the genome (Table S10). In addition, our analysis showed that the unique signatures mapping osa-miR156j and osa-miR166j were identical to those mapping osa-miR156h and osa-miR166i, respectively. Considering that osa-miR156j and osa-miR166j were not successfully mapped on the genome (TIGR 4.0), the loci of them might be identical to osa-miR156h and osa-miR166i.</p><p>Among the unique signatures matching miRNA precursors, several ones matched the precursors in antisense orientation. The unique origin of each signature on the genome suggested that it might be produced exclusively from this site (Table S11). Similarly, analysis on the precursor sequences from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Small RNA Project, ASRP, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://asrp.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/">http://asrp.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/</ext-link>) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (GenBank data libraries, GEO accession number GSE5990, sample GSM139137) showed that this phenomenon is common in various species, and many sRNAs can match mature miRNAs or miRNA*s in antisense orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Recent report showed that a single Hox locus in <italic>Drosophila</italic> produces functional miRNAs from opposite DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>), indicating this phenomenon is conserved throughout the animal and plant kingdoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of 26 novel and 12 candidate miRNAs</title><p>To identify the novel miRNA loci, the consensus surrounding genomic sequence of each sRNA from this study was extracted, and secondary structure of each sequence was predicted with the help of Mfold program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). A Perl script was used to evaluate the paired regions of predicted RNA secondary structures according to the criteria by MIRcheck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Sequences of putative miRNA loci were then analyzed by RepeatMasker to exclude the repetitive sequences. Those contained no repetitive sequences were regarded as candidate precursors and used for further analysis.</p><p>As previously reported, accumulations of miRNA*s were strong supporting evidences for the cleavage by DCLs during the miRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), thus the miRNA identification in this study is mainly dependent on the detection of miRNA*s. Eleven novel miRNA loci were finally identified, excluding three miRNAs (osa-miR810b.1, osa-miR1429 and osa-miR1432; references 8 and 26, which were published during the manuscript revision). Interestingly, the abundance of osa-miR1429* (126 TPQ) were higher than osa-miR1429 (15 TPQ) in seed library, suggesting that the accumulation of miRNA*s may differ in different tissues. Further, sRNAs sequences from other six libraries reported by Lu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) were used to check the presence of miRNA*s, resulting in the

which osa-miR827b was the ortholog of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ath-miR827. Comparison of the candidate precursors with rice ESTs showed that five previously annotated noncoding RNAs were indeed miRNAs. Six precursors, which had matched ESTs and were previously annotated as &#x02018;conserved hypothetical protein&#x02019;, were identified as miRNA candidates (osa-miRc1-c6). Additionally, six candidate miRNAs with abundance &#x0003e;15 TPQ were identified. As a whole, 26 novel (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) and 12 candidate miRNAs (Table S12) were identified from this study (predicted structures were shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn998/DC1">Supplementary Dataset 1</ext-link>).</p><p>Among the novel miRNAs, osa-miR396f was a homolog of osa-miR396 family, which was one of the two novel miRNAs having orthologs in other species. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, miR396 genes can be grouped into two subgroups according to sequences of mature miRNAs. The two annotated novel miRNAs in maize, zma-miR396c from AZM5_13 014 and zma-miR396d from AZM5_11 578, were more conserved with osa-miR396d-e than osa-miR396a-c.</p><p>The osa-miR827b was conserved in both rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In miRBase (V11.0), osa-miR827 was recently identified through similarity analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>), however, no sRNA from the mature miRNA or miRNA* sites of osa-miR827 precursor was obtained in seed library or other public libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In contrast, the mature miRNA from osa-miR827b loci was abundant in seed library (150 TPQ), suggesting that osa-miR827b (rather than osa-miR827) has existent physiological functions.</p><p>Targets of these identified miRNAs were further predicted using the methodology described by Allen <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and targets of 18 novel miRNAs were captured with assignment of mispair score and MFE ratio tolerance limits to &#x02264;4 and &#x02265;0.73, respectively.

Several detected miRNA*s by this study were also included on the chips. To analyze the miRNA expression in seeds in detail, RNAs from embryo and endosperm were extracted individually and used for hybridization. In addition, expression profiles of miRNAs in three vegetative tissues (root, leaf and seedlings) were analyzed and compared with those in seed tissues (Table S15). Analysis showed that most miRNAs were expressed preferentially in one or two tissues, and only some of them were highly expressed in most tested tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A).<fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Expression patterns of the known and novel miRNAs.

We thus select rice 5.8S rRNA as reference gene in the analysis.

Comparison of the miRNAs expression patterns revealed by chip hybridization with the data of a recent publication (GSE11014; 53), in which sRNAs of four tissues were sequenced using 454 technology, revealed the consistence of the chip data with the differentially expressed miRNAs from 454 dataset, after filtering out the low abundance sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn998/DC1">Supplementary Figure 4B</ext-link>).

Recent report showed that different argonaute (AGO) proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> harbor sRNAs with different 5&#x02032; terminal nucleotide, and the miRNAs and miRNA*s are directed in different AGO complexes based on their 5&#x02032; terminal nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). Several homolog AGO proteins were identified in rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure6</xref>A; 65) and our analysis showed the different expression levels of them in the tested tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Especially, two AGO-coding genes (Os03g58600, Os07g09020) homologous to AtAGO5 were predominantly expressed in rice embryo, and an AGO-coding gene (Os06g51310) homologous to AtAGO1 was low expressed in rice endosperm and embryo. The variety of AGO gene abundances in these tissues may determine the abundance of miRNA and miRNA*s in RISCs.<fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic and expression pattern analysis of rice AGOs.

Several recent studies have reported the large-scale sequencing of sRNAs in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>); however, most of them were obtained from the tissues other than seeds. In the study by Lu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), only sRNAs with the abundance more than 100 TPQ were used to predict the putative precursors, which may miss some uncharacterized miRNAs. In present study, all the sRNAs (excluding rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs and snoRNAs) were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), and as a result, 26 novel miRNAs were identified mostly dependent on the accumulations of miRNA*s. The targets of 18 novel miRNAs were predicted, and hybridization with the generated miRNA chip provided a detailed expression profile of known and novel miRNAs in vegetative (root, seedling, young leaf) and reproductive (embryo and endosperm) tissues. These will significantly contribute to the discovery and studies of miRNAs in rice, especially rice seeds.</p><sec><title>Most rice sRNAs are derived from transposable elements</title><p>Of the 81 530 sRNA clusters 72 173 contained interspersed repetitive sequences (Table S6), and of all the identified signatures from rice seeds, miRNAs account for &#x0003c;1.5%, which is much lower than in other rice tissues (8.8%, 36.6% and 12.6% from the inflorescences, seedlings and stems, respectively, 24) or <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> inflorescences (40%) and seedlings (62%, 22). The low ratios of miRNAs in rice tissues may because that the complex rice genome contains more interspersed and inverted repetitive sequences, and produces many repeat-associated sRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The even lower ratio of miRNAs (higher ratio of rasiRNAs) in rice seeds suggested the important roles of rasiRNAs in seed development. As indicated by Girard and Hannon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>), the robust defense of transposition activity coincides with the transposon challenge in the germline, where new insertions of transposons can be transmitted to next generation. High abundance of rasiRNAs in seeds may serve as a suppressor of transposon to prevent its propagation in rice genome. Our results also suggested that miRNAs were low expressed in pre-differentiation tissues including embryo. Indeed, a recent study showed that genes targeted by miRNAs are expressed in a higher level in embryo than in mature tissues in mouse and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, suggesting that miRNAs are low expressed in embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). Furthermore, analysis on the top 10 highly expressed individual miRNAs revealed that seven of them were with the highest expression in tissues other than embryo or endosperm (Table S15). Although several miRNAs were highly expressed in embryo or endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), the numbers of these miRNAs were less, and the expression levels of them were much lower than those top highly expressed miRNAs in other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, Table S9). As whole, the total abundance of miRNAs was low in rice seeds.</p><p>nat-siRNA may be formed when natural antisense transcripts are expressed in same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). After comparing the 687 bidirectional transcript pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>), we failed to identify any signatures matching both pairs, which supports the hypothesis that the bidirectional transcripts pairs were mainly to induce the alternative splicing or polyadenylation, other than serving as origins of sRNAs by forming RNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Some registered miRNAs appear to be repetitive sequences</title><p>In the guidelines proposed by Ambros <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), miRNAs can be distinguished from siRNAs in several aspects, including genomic origin characters and biogenesis mechanisms. Our study showed that some registered miRNA precursors contain transposon or retrotransposon-like repetitive sequences, even the whole structure of them were annotated as retrotransposon (such as <italic>Stowaway</italic>) (Table S8). Furthermore, our analysis showed that most of these repeat-associated precursors could generate sRNAs from two strands randomly (Table S9), thus these miRNA precursors might not be <italic>bona fide</italic> miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Several recently reported miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) also contained transposable elements (Table S8), among which three (osa-miR1440, osa-miR1441 and osa-miR1442) can produce sRNAs from two strands randomly (Table S9). During their analysis, repeat-associated borderline precursors were used as positive controls, thus some candidate miRNA precursors similar to repeat elements were also identified as miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). This indicates that it is necessary to distinguish the <italic>bona fide</italic> miRNAs from borderline ones for annotating the novel miRNAs. According to the definition of a miRNA, one of the most critical criteria is that the miRNA should originate from a single-strand RNA transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Thus, if a locus produces sRNAs from both two strands, this locus should be siRNA locus; if a candidate precursor contains repeat elements, it should be very careful to annotate it as an miRNA, as most of the precursors of this type can produce sRNAs from both strands and many of these sRNAs are not from the site of mature miRNAs or miRNA*s (Table S9).</p></sec><sec><title>Diverse regulatory effects of miRNAs in rice seeds</title><p>Auxin plays crucial roles during seed development, including pattern formation, cell division and cell expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>). The mutation of <italic>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 2 (ARF2)</italic> leads to dramatic increase of seed size and weight in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>). osa-miR167, the target genes of which encode transcription factors ARF6 and ARF8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>), was preferentially expressed in rice seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). In addition, osa-miR167 was induced by auxin, resulting in the decrease of ARF8 mRNA abundance. ARF8 positively regulated the expression of OsGH3.2, a rice indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-conjugating enzyme, which in turn participated in the control of cellular-free IAA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). In rice seeds, the IAA level is around 40-fold higher than in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>), which is consistent with the high abundance of osa-miR167 in rice seeds and suggests the regulatory roles of auxin-miR167-ARF8-OsGH3.2 pathway in auxin amount and hence the rice seed development.</p><p>Many target genes other than transcription factor coding genes are also regulated by miRNAs preferentially expressed in seeds, including those encode copper-binding proteins and carbohydrate metabolism enzymes. Such kind of functional relation is similar to miRNAs isolated from developing xylem of stems, which are predicted to target genes involved in biosynthesis of cell wall metabolites in <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>). Among the miRNAs that highly expressed in embryo, four miRNA families (osa-miR397, osa-miR398, osa-miR408 and osa-miR528) targeted genes coding copper-binding proteins (17,20,38; Table S16). Interestingly, all these target genes were suppressed in embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A), suggesting the roles of these miRNAs in maintaining the copper homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>) and/or the ROS levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>) in rice embryo.</p><p>osa-miR397 and osa-miR528 are predicted to target the mRNAs of L-ascorbate oxidases (AO), which catalyze the oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA) to yield dehydroascorbate (DHA) to regulate the apoplastic redox state and modulate plant growth and defense responses by regulating signal transduction cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). It has been reported that the accumulation of DHA oxidized by AO could trigger the arrest of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>). The high amounts of these two miRNAs will result in the low level of AO genes, which may in turn maintain the low level of apoplastic DHA in seeds. This is consistent with the higher cell-division ability of seeds at early development stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential accumulations of miRNAs and miRNA*s</title><p>It is believed that miRNA*s are gradually degraded while mature miRNAs guide the silencing of target mRNAs in miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Our study indicates that some miRNA*s were also accumulated at certain tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Abundance of osa-miR390* was even higher than miR390 in rice embryo (Table S15). The relations between the accumulation abundance of mature miRNAs and miRNA*s are varied: some miRNAs and miRNA*s accumulate at same tissue(s), whereas some accumulate at different tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Differential accumulation of miRNAs and miRNA*s may due to the different activities of proteins directly involved in sRNAs biogenesis. Indeed, several rice <italic>AGO</italic> genes were differently expressed in the tested tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), and abundances of miRNAs and miRNA*s may be altered due to the variety of <italic>AGO</italic> gene abundances in these tissues.</p><p>The highly abundant miRNA*s may have physiological functions in directing the mRNA cleavage. Similar as previous report, when the miRNA (let-7)/miRNA* duplex is provided, RISC can cleave the antisense RNA of let-7 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>), which may be directed by let-7*. In addition, a recent report in mouse also showed that both strands of miRNAs could target equal number of genes to suppress their expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>) and many human miRNAs in miRBase are paired miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>). Therefore, miRNA*s accumulated at tissues different from mature miRNAs may play their roles with the similar mechanism.</p><p>Our study also suggests that miRNA*s may regulate mature miRNA functions when both of them are highly expressed in same tissue(s). It was known that during the generation of phased ta-siRNAs, miR390 hits the transcripts of <italic>TAS3</italic> loci to trigger the biogenesis of ta-siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>). However, we did not detect the signatures matching <italic>TAS3</italic> transcripts in rice seeds, whereas sRNAs from <italic>TAS3</italic> transcripts were sequenced in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This, quite possibly, may due to that high level of miR390* in rice seeds suppresses the miR390 function.</p><p>The accumulation of miRNA*s may due to the presence of a protein regulator stabling the miRNA/miRNA* duplex. It has been reported that the <italic>Beet yellows virus</italic> p21 and the <italic>Tomato bushy stunt virus</italic> p19 can bind the miRNA/miRNA* duplex to increase the miRNA* abundance, resulting in the deduced cleavages of target mRNAs mediated by miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>). Recently, a model showed how mouse miR138-2 is post-transcriptionally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>), of which a certain inhibitor of Dicer was proposed to be present in some tissues like kidney, liver and others, and then mature miR138-2 can only be detected in those tissues where the inhibitor is absent or without function. This inhibitor may function like the regulator of miRNA/miRNA* duplex, as we proposed, to regulate the function of Dicer by binding to the duplex.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>State Key Project of Basic Research (2005CB120 803); Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCX2-YW-N-058); Nature Science Foundation (No. 30 721 061); and High-Tech program (2006AA10A102).
