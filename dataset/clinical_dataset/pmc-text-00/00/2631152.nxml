China had approximately 140,000 MDR TB cases in 2004, or one third of the estimated global burden of MDR TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-Zignol1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In some provinces of China, the prevalence of MDR TB among new cases and previously treated cases was above 10&#x00025; and 30&#x00025;, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-Aziz1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the number and percentage of MDR TB cases in Shanghai, one of the largest cities in Asia, has not previously been reported.</p><p>In 2006, multiple cases of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB were reported in South Africa, raising concerns that XDR strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> are prevalent in other populations. Many of the cases reported from South Africa occurred among HIV-infected persons and there was a high case fatality rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-Gandhi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

XDR TB has not previously been formally reported in mainland China, but given the high prevalence of TB nationwide, the large number of MDR TB cases in the country, and the long-time use of second line anti-TB drugs and fluroquinolones, the existence of XDR TB in China seems inevitable.</p><p>We performed a retrospective study to determine the number and percentage of TB patients in Shanghai with MDR and XDR TB, and to determine whether there is transmission of MDR and XDR strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in Shanghai.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study using the existing data and specimens at the Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Shanghai CDC), from TB patients who were diagnosed in Shanghai during March 2004 through November 2007. Since 1995 in Shanghai, all suspected pulmonary TB cases detected in general hospitals or community health centers were referred to a specialized TB hospital or TB clinic for further diagnostic tests, including sputum smear examinations, culture and chest radiography. There were 31 designated district TB hospitals in Shanghai; all of the pretreatment positive cultures from patients in each hospital were sent to the Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (TRL) at Shanghai CDC for drug susceptibility testing and species identification. Shanghai CDC also collected data on the social and demographic characteristics, treatment history, clinical characteristics, drug-susceptibility test results, and clinical outcomes of each patient. All of the investigation protocols in this study were approved by ethics committee of Fudan University. Since this was a retrospective study and all patients' information was routinely collected by Shanghai CDC for analysis and reports to the government, consent was not obtained from the patients during 2004 through 2006. We started a research project in 2007, and informed consent has been obtained from all patients since then for the information to be used in scientific studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Drug susceptibility testing (DST)</title><p>TRL at Shanghai CDC participated in the World Health Organization/International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-World1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

To ensure the consistency and reliability of results, all second-line drug susceptibility testing was performed by a senior technician who had completed and passed the WHO's quality control evaluation. All drugs were obtained from Sigma Life Science Company (USA).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Definitions</title><p>MDR TB was defined as tuberculosis disease caused by a strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that was resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin.

Patients in two clusters lived in different districts, but patients in the other two clusters lived in the same district and had been diagnosed and treated in the same hospital and no additional epidemiological links between them were detected. None of the isolates with XDR were in a genotype cluster.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study showed that 5.6&#x00025; of the tuberculosis patients in Shanghai were infected with a strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that was MDR. Furthermore, 6.3&#x00025; of the MDR TB patients were XDR. Nearly 55&#x00025; (6/11) of the XDR TB patients were new cases, suggesting there is transmission of highly drug-resistant strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in Shanghai.</p><p>Since second-line drugs have been used in Shanghai for several decades and there is no standard treatment strategy for patients with MDR and pre-XDR strains, there was concern that the prevalence of XDR TB in Shanghai would be higher. Based on our study using specimens from the 31 designated district tuberculosis hospitals, we report that XDR TB occurs in Shanghai, albeit currently with a relatively low prevalence during the study period.</p><p>After XDR TB became a public concern during 2006, many countries retested their stored isolates and XDR strains were reported in 41 countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-World2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The reported percentage of XDR TB patients among the MDR TB patients varies between countries, from 3&#x00025; in the United States to 19&#x00025; in Latvia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-3">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, and the average rate is about 10&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-4">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The percentage of MDR and XDR TB patients that are detected depends on the study design, the sampling frame and the study population. For example, hospital based studies will likely include a greater proportion of seriously ill TB patients, including patients who are undergoing retreatment. In contrast, community based studies will likely provide a lower estimate of the percentage of total TB patients who are infected with an MDR or XDR strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>More than half of the infections with MDR and XDR strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in our study occurred among new TB cases, a finding which suggests that the transmission of MDR and XDR strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is a serious problem in Shanghai. The prevalence of primary drug resistance may actually be higher than our estimate. Transmission of drug-resistant <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> can cause primary drug resistance among individuals with no prior history of TB, as well as among individuals with a history of prior TB treatment. Previously, we showed that 84&#x00025; of retreated TB patients with drug-resistant disease actually had primary drug resistance, not acquired drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-Li1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Andrews, et al. also reported that most of the MDR/XDR cases in South Africa were primary drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-Andrews1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a recent meta-analysis showed that primary drug resistance was associated with poor treatment outcomes if treatment regimens were not based on drug susceptibility test results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-Lew1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In communities with a high rate of primary drug resistance, approaches which assign treatment regimens based solely on the patient's history of prior treatment may amplify drug resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-Lew1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. MDR and XDR patients in China are often poor and cannot afford the second-line anti-TB drugs, making it difficult to achieve treatment success. MDR and XDR patients without adequate treatment regimens will continue to be sources of infection, causing more MDR and XDR infections and TB patients in their communities. Therefore, new strategies, including rapid drug susceptibility testing techniques, are urgently needed.</p><p>To identify chains of transmission of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is arduous work, requiring a prospective population-based cohort study design, high case detection rates and additional epidemiological information. In the present study, four clusters of patients with identical genotype patterns were identified among 175 MDR TB patients, but epidemiological links between them were difficult to establish. Another limitation of the present study is that isolates of some TB patients were not available for drug susceptibility testing and genotyping, or their drug susceptibility test was performed with the absolute concentration method. However, this is a retrospective study and we were able to investigate only some of the MDR TB patients. Therefore, the recent transmission of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> based on genotyping results is likely underestimated.</p><p>Overall, the treatment outcomes of MDR TB patients have been less favorable than the treatment outcomes of TB patients whose disease is caused by a pan-susceptible strain, a mono-resistant, or a poly-resistant strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-Espinal1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-DeRiemer1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Some MDR TB patients can be successfully treated, even as outpatients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-Burgos1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The XDR TB epidemic in Tugela Ferry, South Africa, which had a high prevalence of co-infection with HIV and a high case fatality ratio, led some to label XDR TB an &#x0201c;untreatable&#x0201d; disease. However, a study from South Korea reported that more than fifty percent of HIV-uninfected XDR TB patients were successfully treated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-Kim1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, as were 60.4&#x00025; of XDR TB patients in Peru and 41.2&#x00025; of XDR TB patients completed therapy in California <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-Banerjee1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-Mitnick1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our study showed that the cure rate is higher among new TB cases than among previously treated TB cases, whether they were MDR or pre-XDR patients. A previous study reported that TB patients with primary drug resistant tuberculosis had better treatment outcomes than TB patients with acquired drug resistant TB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004370-Seung1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, although this is not always the case. The concept of pre-XDR TB is important for public health purposes, to allow the community to assess how many XDR TB cases are likely to emerge and to make concerted efforts to treat the individuals whose disease is caused by a pre-XDR strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Theoretically, it is difficult to gain resistance to two kinds of drugs simultaneously. In our study, 78&#x00025; (43/55) of the pre-XDR isolates were resistant to a fluoroquinolone and were, therefore, one mutation away from becoming XDR. Fluoroquinolones have been used extensively in Shanghai during the past twenty years to treat drug-resistant TB patients and retreatment patients.</p><p>In summary, 5.6&#x00025; of the TB cases in Shanghai were infected with a MDR strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and further drug susceptibility testing showed that 6.3&#x00025; of the patients whose isolate was MDR were actually XDR. More than half of the patients with MDR and XDR were new cases, suggesting that the transmission of drug-resistant strains in Shanghai is a serious problem. Currently, the rapid diagnosis and treatment of persons with TB, particularly any form of drug-resistant TB, are high priority public health interventions. Universal drug susceptibility testing is recommended for new and retreatment TB cases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Peter Small for his valuable review of the
