The 5-year survival rate is 45% in Norway, ranging between &#x0003e; 80% in stage I of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification to &#x0003c; 20% in FIGO stage IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The age-adjusted incidence rate of ovarian cancer is 14 per 100,000 women yearly in the United States and 11.8 per 100,000 women in Norway. Bilateral- oophorectomy (BO) is the primary treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer combined with chemotherapy dependent on the FIGO stage. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], however, the majority experience several relapses and are repeatedly treated with chemotherapy.</p><p>Several studies have shown that epithelial ovarian cancer survivors (EOCSs) have significantly higher levels of somatic and mental symptoms as well as fatigue compared to women of the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Stewart et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] reported that among 200 EOCSs without evidence of disease for two years, 98% regarded their health as good or excellent, though 54% had current pain or discomfort. We have previously shown that compared to controls, EOCSs &#x0003e; 18 months after primary treatment had significantly more chronic fatigue, somatic and mental morbidity, somatic complaints, use of medications and more frequently used health care services than population-based controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. After treatment, EOCSs will repeatedly consult their gynaecologists and their regular general practitioners (GPs), who will assess the EOCSs' performance and health status by multiple questions in addition to physical examinations and laboratory tests. On the other hand, a single statement about self-rated health (SRH) allows the patients to express various aspects of their health in a global statement. If considered as "poor", more focused follow-up questions may be raised, identifying symptoms which may be accessible for therapeutic intervention. If SRH is stated as "good", no further investigation is needed at the moment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. There is a widespread consensus that a simple, global SRH questions may provide a useful summary of the patients' overall health status, and SRH has thus been considered as an important measure of treatment outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A frequently used measure of SRH is a single question asking patients to rate their overall health on a scale from excellent to very poor, and there are many alternative phrasings of such a global question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Two questions of the European Organization and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ C-30) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] have been used in various SRH studies: item #29 "How would you evaluate your overall health during the past week?" and item #30:"How you rate your overall quality of life during the last week". Both items are scored on 7 point Liker scales, and the responses to these two items are highly correlated. The literature, however, has shown that overall health relates principally to somatic problems, while quality of life encompasses mental health to a greater extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Butt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] found single-item screening questions to be quite effective for fatigue, pain, distress and anorexia in ambulatory cancer practice with a mixed sample of cancer patients. Also Rohrer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] showed in their cross sectional study of 1,183 patients in five community clinics that the use of a single &#x02013; item measure of SRH proved to have clinical value in primary care and helpful to identify a number of somatic, metal and quality of life symptoms. Shadbolt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] reported that SRH responses were valid, reliable and responsive to objective change of health in patients with advanced non-gynecological cancer. Al-Windy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] investigated SRH in a general population based sample of 470 adult persons of multi-ethnic origins who visited a Swedish Health Care Centre. On the basis of SRH the authors grouped the persons into a poor and a good health group, and found SRH helpful to identify the 46% of the patients who had a significant number of symptoms. Eriksson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] in a random sample of 8,200 Swedish persons compared three different SRH questions in order to find the best question measuring lifestyle, psycho-social, mental and physical health and found this a useful method. The results imply that the different measure represents parallel assessments of subjective health and that measures without specified response options are better in younger than older population groups.</p><p>To our knowledge there are no studies of SRH and its associations to somatic and mental morbidity in EOCSs. We therefore wanted to: 1) Explore the somatic, mental and lifestyle variables associated with a single question concerning SRH (EORTC) (QLQ C-30) item #29 "How would you evaluate your overall health during the past week?" for therapeutic use in a clinical setting. 2) Explore to what extent the SRH score of EOCS differ from those of age-matched women in the general population (NORM).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient selection</title><p>The EOCSs were 20&#x02013;70 years at survey with &#x0003e; 18 months survival since diagnosis. They had been treated according to protocols for FIGO stage I-III epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) at the The Norwegian Radium Hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In order to get a sufficiently powered sample size, we had to include cases back to 1979. The inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 297 EOCSs who were alive by September 2004, and who received a mailed questionnaire. Ten cases were subsequently excluded after revision of histology, leaving an eligible sample of 287 EOCSs. A total of 184/189 (97%) EOCSs returned the questionnaire with valid rating concerning SRH, and had basic anthropometric measures and blood samples taken at their regular general practitioners (GPs). One reminder was sent to non-responders after four weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment principles</title><p>All EOCSs had primary surgery with BO, and the majority also had hysterectomy, omentectomy and maximum debulking. Primary treatment was done according to established protocols, as either surgery only, or combined with subsequent chemotherapy depending on FIGO stage, histology and ploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Platinum-based chemotherapy represented the most frequent systemic treatment. Paclitaxel was incorporated into the combination chemotherapy in the 1990-ies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The majority of EOCSs received combined carboplatin and taxol as first line treatment, and nine patients got cisplatin monotherapy. Relapses were treated with various types of chemotherapy administered as combinations or mono-therapy. Among the drugs used were paclitaxel, carboplatin, gemcitabine and tamoxifen, and four EOCSs also had local radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><sec><title>EORTC QLQ-C30</title><p>The EORTC QLQ-C30 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] consists of 30 items comprising five functional scales, an overall Global health scale/QOL scale, three symptom scales, and six single symptom items. The scores are transformed to 0 &#x02013; 100 scales: on the functional scale higher scores represent better functioning, while on the symptom scale higher scores mean more severe symptoms. In this study the presence of somatic complaints was defined by the median scores (for nausea and pain a score &#x02265; 16.67, for dyspnoea, insomnia, constipation, lack of appetite and diarrhoea a score &#x02265; 33.33).</p><p>Item # 29 had seven score alternatives and was considered to reflect SRH. We transformed the 1 to 7 response score to 0 to 100 and used the median score (66.67) to separate the EOCSs into a "poor SRH" and a" good SRH" group. The correlation between item #29 and #30 was r = 0.83 with 69% explained variance in our EOCSs sample.</p><p>As EORTC QLQ-C30 has been psychometrically validated cross-culturally, all scales and single items have been tested according to standards for reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Each item is scored on a four-point scale from 0 (not present) to 3 (considerable), and the item scores are summarized for each scale, giving HADS-D and HADS-A scores. Based on the literature, cases of HADS-defined anxiety disorder or depression were defined by a score of &#x02265; 8 on HADS-A or HADS-D, respectively. Internal consistency of the anxiety subscale was &#x003b1; = .88, and of depression &#x003b1; = .84 in the EOCSs sample.</p><p><italic>The Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ) </italic>consists of a total of 13 items, where 11 assess the presence and intensity of fatigue symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Seven items assess Physical Fatigue and four assess Mental Fatigue. Summarized they represent the Total Fatigue score. Based on Total Fatigue score and duration of fatigue &#x02265; 6 months, caseness of Chronic Fatigue (CF) are identified. Internal consistency was for physical fatigue &#x003b1; = .92, mental fatigue &#x003b1; = .68, and total fatigue &#x003b1; = .89 in the EOCSs sample.</p><p><italic>The Body Image Scale (BIS) </italic>is a 10-items self-rating-scale developed to assess changes of the body image in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The BIS focuses on how EOCSs feel about their appearance during the past week and on changes in appearance due to her cancer and/or treatment. Each item is scored on a four point Likert scale: from 'not at all' (0) to 'very much very' (3). Increasing BIS score represents poorer body image. The internal consistency was &#x003b1; = .91 of the BIS in the EOCSs sample.</p><p><italic>The Intimate Bond Measure (IBM) </italic>is a 24-item self-rating scale measuring experienced care and control from her partner in the patient's current relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Both care and control are assessed with 12 items. Each item is scored on a four point Likert scale from 'not at all' (0) to 'very true' (3). Higher values mean more care or control. Among the EOCSs in paired relations the internal consistency for care was &#x003b1; = .96 and for control &#x003b1; = .92.</p><p><italic>The Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire(M-QOL) </italic>is a 29 items questionnaire covering the vasomotor, physical, psychosocial and sexual menopause-related domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The M-QOL was included since has been shown that menopausal symptoms can be present for a long time in EOCSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Each item is first scored as present or not, and if present a seven point scale of severity from 'not at all bothered' (0) to 'extremely bothered' (6) is filled in.

The SAQ-F has a time frame of last month, and consists of 10 items with three subscales: sexual pleasure (7 items), sexual discomfort (2 items) and change in sexual habit (1 item). Sexual pleasure and discomfort are rated on a four-point Likert scale from 'not at all' (0) to 'very much' (3). An increasing score means more pleasure and more discomfort, respectively. In the sexually active EOCSs the internal consistency for SAQ-pleasure was &#x003b1; = .88 and &#x003b1; = .78 for SAQ-discomfort.</p><p><italic>Education </italic>was categorized into three levels based on the number of completed school years (&#x02264; 10 years, 11&#x02013;12 years, &#x0003e; 12 years). <italic>Paired relation </italic>described those married or cohabiting.

Among these 184 EOCSs the median age at diagnosis was 52 years (range 23&#x02013;68 years), median age at survey 59 years (range 31&#x02013;71 years) and median follow-up time 4 years (range 2&#x02013;27 years). The FIGO stage distribution was: stage I 42%, stage II 18% and stage III 40%. Thirty-three percent of EOCSs had surgery only as primary treatment, while 67% also got chemotherapy.

Item #29 of the EORTC QLQ C-30 was thus strongly associated with common somatic complaints, which explained 39% of the variance using dimensional SRH and 46% using categorical SRH, but also with age, physical impairment and mental distress which explained a small but significant association. The 7% difference in explained variance using dimensional or categorical SRH and the different significance of pain, physical symptoms and prior use of psychotropic medicaments is important and interesting, but difficult to explain. The main interpretation of both models show a significant and important contribution for symptoms which appears to have clinical implications. The relevance of this single item in EOCSs may be supported by the fact that these symptoms are known to be frequently present among EOCSs, and are all conditions which may be accessible for therapeutic interventions. Interestingly the cancer-related variables (FIGO stage, recurrence within 6 months, chemotherapy ever), use of medication, life style and menopausal variables did not make any significant contributions to the explained variance of the SRH score in EOCSs used both as dimensional and categorical dependent variable. We did not observe any significant differences in the overall distribution of the SRH scores between the EOCSs and NORM, however, it was a difference in the highest score level, as a significantly higher proportion of controls recorded a SRH score of 100 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This indicates an important difference, indeed.</p><sec><title>Comparison with other studies of SRH</title><p>SRH has not been studied in EOCSs previously. The use of a single &#x02013; item measure of SRH has proven to have clinical value in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], as we also confirmed in our study. In accordance to the studies of Butt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and Shadbolt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] in mixed samples of cancer patients, we found that a single question concerning SRH could be helpful for health care professionals to screen for especially physical problems in EOCSs, but also fatigue and mental distress. Compared to studies of general population samples by Al-Windi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and Eriksson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], we found that SRH also was associated with demographic and multiple somatic and mental symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical implications</title><p>SRH allows the respondents in a summarized form to express different aspects of their health which they consider relevant, and some aspects of which may be accessible for therapeutic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Somatic complaints showed the strongest associations with the SRH score. To ask for SRH last week may be a quick and useful question to screen for symptoms in EOCSs which thus can be recognized by health care professionals. Somatic complaints, but also impairment and fatigue, are frequently present among EOCSs whether they are heavily treated or not. They may experience constipation or insomnia associated to surgical menopause or worry; some may have nausea and bowel dysfunction due to bowel surgery as part of primary or relapse surgery. Those with stabile disease or progression often experience various somatic symptoms due to peritoneal and bowel cancer spread, side effects of medication, or related to repeated courses of chemotherapy over months. Opportunities for treatment may then be easily evaluated by the gynaecologist or the regular GPs and provide basis for development of new strategies for better medical follow-up treatment of EOCSs on somatic and mental morbidity, fatigue, sexual problems, and quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Strength and limitation</title><p>The 66% respondent rate in EOCSs is considered as quite good since many women were treated many years ago and some of the questionnaires contained sensitive familial and sexual issues. We have used internationally accepted instruments that are well validated and showing good psychometric properties in our study, except for the M-QOL sexual domain. We also have analyzed attrition data on the non-respondents. There were only few significant differences between the responding and non-responding EOCSs, which indicate that the findings could be valid for our total sample of EOCSs and more generally.</p><p>One limitation of our study is that the EOCSs were treated over a long time period (29 years), however treatment and follow-up protocols were considered to be quite similar during that time period. Furthermore, the phenomenon of "response shift", explained as how individuals integrate changes in their health state so that their internal standards, values, or concepts of quality of life are nearly unchanged from before, may be considered as a limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], as studies have shown that patients with objectively "poor health" often valued their health status as almost normal based on response shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This fact may also influence the experience of pain and other somatic complaints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and may explain the lack of the overall differences we found between cases and controls.</p><p>The cross- sectional design has its limitation by the present knowledge about previous health status. The use of item #29 of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the median score as the cut off of a clinical classification for "poor" and "good" SRH may be open for discussion, compared to the use of the variable as a continuous measure. However, we found that a cut-off for "poor" and "good" SRH was useful to identify those at highest risk of morbidities and complaints and decreased SRH in EOCSs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SRH was strongly associated to common somatic complaints, but also to impairment and fatigue, which are well known symptoms in EOCSs, but not to cancer-related variables as FIGO stage, recurrence &#x0003c; 6 months or chemotherapy ever. A single question concerning SRH last week might be a quick method to screen for symptoms in EOCSs, some of which may be accessible for therapeutic interventions and in addition to cancer &#x02013; related questions.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>EOCSs: Epithelial ovarian cancer survivors; SRH: Self- Rated Health; FIGO: The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics; BO: Bilateral- oophorectomy; GPs: General practitioners; EORTC: European Organization and Treatment of Cancer; QLQ C-30: Quality of Life Questionnaire; NORM: Women in the general population; HADS: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; FQ: The Fatigue Questionnaire; BIS: The Body Image Scale; IBM: The Intimate Bond Measure; M-QOL: The Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire; SAQ: The Sexual Activity Questionnaire; HRT: Hormone replacement therapy; ESs: effect sizes; R<sup>2</sup>-change: explained variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AHL has contributed to conception, design, provision of study material and patients, collection and assembly of data, data analysis and interpretation and manuscript writing.</p><p>AD has contributed to conception, design, provision of study materials and patients, collection and assembly of data, data analysis and interpretation, financial and administrative support and manuscript writing.
