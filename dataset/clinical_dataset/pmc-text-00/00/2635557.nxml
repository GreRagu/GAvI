Crucially, the anaphase inhibitor, securin, and Cyclin B1, which maintains cells in mitosis, must not be degraded until all the chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle. To achieve this a conserved mechanism called the &#x02018;Spindle Checkpoint&#x02019; (SAC) is activated by improperly attached kinetochores, and prevents the APC/C ubiquitin ligase recognising Cyclin B1 and securin (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). A number of conserved proteins have been identified as components of the SAC, including Mad1, Mad2, Mad3/BubR1, Bub1, Bub3, Mps1 and the Aurora B kinase. The primary target of the SAC is the Cdc20/fizzy protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> that is an essential APC/C activator (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>). However, it is unclear how the SAC regulates Cdc20. Current models of the checkpoint propose that the Mad2 protein has a crucial role either to sequester Cdc20, or act in conjunction with the BubR1 and Bub3 proteins to form an inhibitor called the &#x02018;Mitotic Checkpoint Complex&#x02019; (MCC) reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>. The prominence given to the Mad2-Cdc20 complex is understandable because the crystal structure of Mad2 bound to a Cdc20 mimicking-peptide predicts that Mad2 changes conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref> to bind Cdc20 tightly via a &#x02018;safety belt&#x02019; mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, although another inhibitory complex comprised of BubR1 and Bub3 has also been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>.</p><p id="P5">Recently, it has been suggested that inhibitory complexes have to be actively dissociated by the ubiquitination of Cdc20 mediated by the APC/C to turn off the SAC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>.

In contrast to the prevailing models, we find that Cdc20 does not accumulate in a stoichiometric complex with Mad2, but primarily in a complex with BubR1 and Bub3. Moreover, although Cdc20 is ubiquitinated by the APC/C this ubiquitination is needed to target Cdc20 for destruction to maintain the checkpoint and not to release Cdc20 from a checkpoint complex: indeed, a non-ubiquitinatable form of Cdc20 overcomes the checkpoint. We suggest that the SAC is maintained through BubR1-Bub3 presenting Cdc20 to the APC/C as a substrate, and that the primary role of Mad2 is to generate the BubR1-Bub3-Cdc20 complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Cdc20 is degraded by the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint</title><p id="P7">We set out to determine how the SAC inactivated Cdc20 in human cells and noticed that although Cdc20 levels apparently remained constant during a SAC arrest, they increased almost three fold on adding the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1A</xref>), indicating that Cdc20 might be continually synthesised and degraded during the SAC. To test this we inhibited protein synthesis by adding cycloheximide and found the level of Cdc20 dropped substantially (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A &#x00026; B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S1B</xref>). A time-course showed that the half-life of Cdc20 in nocodazole- or taxol-arrested cells was &#x0223c;30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>). Cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1B</xref>) and securin (not shown) were also degraded in SAC-arrested cells with a half-life of &#x0223c; 1 hr, as previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>. Cdc20 levels did not change when we added rapamycin, which only inhibits cap (eIF4E)-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1C</xref>), meaning that during mitosis Cdc20 may be synthesised from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Blotting for phospho-S6 kinase showed that rapamycin had inhibited the mTOR pathway and was thus likely to have inhibited eIF4E-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1D</xref>). We confirmed the checkpoint-dependent degradation of Cdc20 in a live-cell assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> using a YFP-Cdc20 fusion protein. YFP-Cdc20 retained the functional properties of Cdc20 because it rescued cells depleted of Cdc20 by siRNA, localised to kinetochores in mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> and was degraded as cells exited mitosis. YFP-Cdc20 fluorescence levels immediately began to decline in prometaphase or metaphase cells when we activated the SAC with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1E</xref>). When we added nocodazole or taxol to interphase cells, YFP-Cdc20 only began to be degraded at nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1F</xref>), and was stabilised by MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1E and F</xref>).

To analyse this we ectopically expressed various Venus-tagged Cdc20 mutants and measured their degradation in nocodazole-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>).

To test this we analysed the interactions between Cdc20, the APC/C, and checkpoint proteins by size-exclusion chromatography and quantitative immunoblotting. (We used nitrogen cavitation to lyse the cells, which solubilised &#x0003e;95% of Cdc20, the APC/C and the checkpoint proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>), and measured the stoichiometry of protein complexes by calibrating our antibodies using recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S2</xref>) We used fluorescently-labelled secondary antibodies and measured the signal on a LiCOR Odyssey scanner, which is linear over a 10<sup>4</sup> range and thus far more quantitative than ECL, although errors could be introduced in the protein transfer, recognition by the primary antibody and binding between the primary and secondary antibodies.).</p><p id="P11">In either nocodazole or taxol-arrested cells the bulk of Cdc20 migrated in two large complexes, one of &#x0223c;2 MDa and one of &#x0223c;670 kDa (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>). Quantitative immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3A &#x00026; B</xref>) and immunoprecipitations from peak fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">FigS2</xref>) showed that the 2 MDa complex contained the APC/C, BubR1 and Bub3, whereas the 670 kDa complex contained BubR1 and Bub3, but no APC/C. Both complexes had very little Mad2, the bulk of which migrated at a size likely corresponding to free Mad2 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>). From the amounts of proteins in immunoprecipitates of Cdc20 from the 2 MDa and 670 kDa complexes, we estimate that only &#x0223c;5% of Cdc20 was bound to Mad2 in cells with an active checkpoint, whereas the molar ratio of BubR1 to Cdc20 was between 0.5 and 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>). Thus, the 670 kDa complex we detected probably corresponded to the Bub3-BubR1-Cdc20 checkpoint complex identified by Tang et al. (2001) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> and Fang (2002) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> rather than the MCC complex where Mad2, BubR1, Bub3 and Cdc20 were proposed to be present with 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>.</p><p id="P12">When we blocked Cdc20 degradation with MG132, Cdc20 accumulated in both the 2 MDa and 670 kDa complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4B</xref>) and immunoprecipitating the APC/C verified the increase in binding to Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>). In addition a third complex appeared running at approximately 200 kDa, which was likely to be free Cdc20 since it did not co-migrate with any of the known Cdc20 partners: the Mad and Bub proteins, the APC/C, and the CCT chaperone complex that migrates at &#x0223c;800 kDa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>. Moreover, when we released the checkpoint by adding the Aurora B inhibitor ZM447439 to taxol- or nocodazole-treated cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, but retained cells in mitosis by adding MG132, Cdc20 levels in the 670 kDa complex dropped and more migrated as &#x02018;free&#x02019; Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Identical results were obtained when we analysed cells in which we released the checkpoint by washing out the spindle poison in the presence of MG132 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S4</xref>). The appearance of some Cdc20 not bound to checkpoint proteins upon the addition of MG132 indicated that preventing Cdc20 degradation caused Cdc20 to exceed the level of the BubR1-Bub3 complex, in agreement with there being similar amounts of Cdc20 and BubR1 in checkpoint-arrested cells (1:1:1:3, Cdc20:BubR1:APC/C:Mad2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S2</xref>).</p><p id="P13">After releasing the checkpoint the amount of BubR1 migrating with the APC/C decreased but the amount of Cdc20 bound to the APC/C remained the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), likely corresponding to active APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>.</p><p id="P14">These results were consistent with Cdc20 binding first to BubR1 to form the 670 kDa complex when the checkpoint was active, and subsequently being presented to the APC/C as a substrate for ubiquitination, thereby forming the 2 MDa complex. By inhibiting degradation we likely blocked this pathway, causing both the 2 MDa and the intermediate 670 kDa complex to accumulate. In support of this, the amount of Cdc20 and BubR1 bound to the APC/C increased when the proteasome was inhibited, whereas it decreased on adding cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Since we did not find significant amounts of Mad2 bound to Cdc20 we asked whether, as in yeast, Mad2 was required for Cdc20 to bind to BubR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, but BubR1 was not required for binding between Mad2 and Cdc20. Consistent with this, siRNA against Mad2 caused a substantial drop in the amount of Cdc20 bound to BubR1 in SAC-arrested cells maintained in mitosis with MG132, whereas BubR1 siRNA did not significantly alter the amount of Mad2 bound to Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig 4F-H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>A non-ubiquitinatable Cdc20 overrides the spindle assembly checkpoint</title><p id="P16">Our data indicated that the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of human Cdc20 catalysed by the APC/C is an important component to maintain the SAC. In contrast, ubiquitination has recently been proposed not to target Cdc20 for degradation but to inactivate the SAC by releasing Cdc20 from a checkpoint complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. To determine whether ubiquitination of Cdc20 is required to maintain or inactivate the SAC, we made a mutant of Cdc20 that could not be ubiquitinated by changing all the lysines to arginines. This &#x02018;K-less&#x02019; mutant of Cdc20 could not be ubiquitinated by the APC/C <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5A</xref>) but was functional because it could activate the APC/C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5A</xref>) and rescue the mitotic arrest induced by siRNA targeting Cdc20 (21 of 21 cells in 3 independent experiments), with a similar timing to wild-type Cdc20 (16 of 16 cells in 3 independent experiments, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S5</xref>). (The siRNA depleted Cdc20 levels by greater than 95% and caused 90% of cells to arrest in mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>.) Furthermore, the K-less mutant was able appropriately to bind and dissociate from checkpoint complexes (see below). The K-less mutant was more stable than wild-type Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>), and consistent with Cdc20 degradation being an integral part of the SAC, it was able to drive checkpoint-arrested HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table</xref> and movie 1) and RPE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table</xref> and movie 2) cells out of mitosis, whereas wild-type Cdc20 expressed at similar levels could not. Furthermore, cells expressing the K-less mutant at lower levels than endogenous Cdc20 could initially establish the checkpoint but were unable to maintain it, whereas cells overexpressing wild-type Cdc20 &#x0223c;10 fold remained arrested. Depleting Mad2 by siRNA abolished this delay with either wild-type or K-less Cdc20 (data not shown). These results pointed towards an important role for ubiquitination and degradation of Cdc20 in maintaining, but not initially imposing, the SAC.</p><p id="P17">To test directly whether APC/C-dependent ubiquitination of Cdc20 was required to release the checkpoint proteins we depleted the APC3 and APC11 subunits from cells by siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6A</xref>). As previously mentioned, this stabilised Cdc20 in SAC-arrested cells, consistent with the APC/C targeting Cdc20 for destruction (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). When we immunoprecipitated Cdc20 from control or APC/C-depleted cells with an active SAC, Cdc20 was bound to BubR1 and some Mad2, and inactivating the checkpoint with ZM447439 showed that there was no difference in the ability of cells with or without APC/C activity to release Cdc20 from Mad2 and BubR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6C and D</xref>). Congruent with this, we found no difference in the ability of wild-type and the lysine-less Cdc20 mutant to be released from checkpoint complexes. We generated cell lines stably expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type or K-less Cdc20 under a tetracyclin inducible promoter and immunoprecipitated FLAG-Cdc20 from cells arrested with nocodazole plus MG132 using an anti-FLAG antibody. Although the K-less mutant bound more Mad2, BubR1 and APC3 (see discussion) than did wild-type Cdc20, there was no difference in the ability of the wild-type and K-less mutant to dissociate from Mad2 and BubR1 upon addition of ZM447439 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig 6E and F</xref>). Thus, we conclude that Cdc20 is ubiquitinated as part of the SAC to target it for destruction and not to release it from a checkpoint complex.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">Here we have shown that the SAC maintains mitotic arrest by degrading Cdc20 as an APC/C substrate. To do this the SAC requires Mad2 but, in contrast to most current models of the checkpoint, we find that in human cells the majority of Mad2 does not form a stable complex with Cdc20. Instead, Cdc20 mostly accumulates in a complex with BubR1 and Bub3, and this complex binds to the APC/C. In the absence of Mad2, however, Cdc20 does not bind to BubR1. Thus, our working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig 7</xref>) is that Mad2 acts catalytically to promote Cdc20 binding to BubR1, which in turn presents Cdc20 to the APC/C as a substrate, targeting it for degradation. Once the checkpoint is inactivated, Cdc20 no longer binds BubR1 and is free to activate the APC/C. This agrees with data from budding yeast that show that Cdc20 is degraded during the spindle checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>, that the BubR1 homologue Mad3 has the greatest effect on Cdc20 stability, and that Mad2 is required for Cdc20 to bind to Mad3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>. Furthermore, overexpressing Cdc20 in budding yeast to 3 fold more than the endogenous level allows cells initially to arrest but not to remain in mitosis in the presence of spindle poisons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>. Thus, maintaining the SAC through degrading Cdc20 may be conserved through evolution.</p><p id="P19">Why Cdc20 has to be degraded to maintain the checkpoint is not clear. The simplest explanation is that it prevents Cdc20 exceeding the level of the BubR1-Bub3 complex. This is feasible because Cdc20 and BubR1 are present at similar levels in the cell, and free Cdc20 appears when we add MG132 to checkpoint-arrested cells. It may not be as simple as this, however, because overexpressing wild-type Cdc20 to &#x0223c;10 fold endogenous levels does not override the checkpoint, and co-expressing BubR1 did not prevent the K-less mutant driving cells out of mitosis (although BubR1 might require Bub3 and/or another checkpoint component to act). Since even small amounts of K-less Cdc20 that are unlikely to exceed the amount of Bub3-BubR1 do overcome the checkpoint, this might indicate that ubiquitination directly inactivates Cdc20. (Although we cannot exclude the possibility that mutating all the lysines also altered other regulatory post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, a mutant version of Cdc20 in which all the Cdk consensus phosphorylation sites were altered to alanine did not override the SAC, not shown). An alternative explanation might relate to our observation that metaphase substrates of the APC/C can only be degraded if they are able to localise to specific places in the cell (F.Cooke, A. Hagting and JP, in preparation). Therefore, overexpressing Cdc20 throughout the cell may not saturate the ability of the degradation machinery if it is only required to keep the levels of Cdc20 low in a specific location, whereas the K-less mutant could locally exceed the level of available checkpoint complexes. We have previously shown that the APC/C itself is recruited to improperly attached kinetochores by the checkpoint proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>, and the data we present here could indicate that it is at unattached kinetochores that BubR1 presents Cdc20 to the APC/C as a substrate.</p><p id="P20">Our model has the advantage that it makes the checkpoint a dynamic system. Previous work by ourselves and others has shown that the SAC and APC/C activity are very tightly coupled: cyclin B1 destruction begins almost immediately after the checkpoint is turned off, and destruction stops almost immediately if the checkpoint is re-imposed (see ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>). Since Cdc20 is constantly synthesised during the SAC, this means that activating or inactivating Mad2 will very rapidly alter APC/C activity by determining whether Cdc20 binds to BubR1 and becomes inactive, or remains free to activate the APC/C.</p><p id="P21">We propose that Mad2 catalyses the binding between Cdc20 and BubR1. (A similar conclusion was reached by Davenport et al. but they used overexpressed protein in asynchronous cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>). However, Mad2 does not have a recognisable catalytic domain and the crystal structures of Mad2 do not give immediate clues to what this catalytic activity might be. The counter evidence, however, that Mad2 alone is a Cdc20 inhibitor, or forms a stoichiometric part of the Cdc20-inhibitory complex, is not strong. Mad2 is a very poor inhibitor <italic>in vitro</italic>, and in fission yeast, Mad3/BubR1 is essential for Mad2 to block cells in mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>. There are also caveats to the method that defined the stoichiometry of the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> as 1:1:1:1 Mad2:BubR1:Bub3:Cdc20, where cells were only labelled with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>S-methionine for 6 hours, which is insufficient to label long-lived proteins to equilibrium.</p><p id="P22">Since the APC/C requires an activator to recognise its substrates, it is an interesting question whether the same molecule of Cdc20 acts as both activator and substrate during the SAC, or whether Cdc20 bound to BubR1 requires another APC/C activator to be degraded. We cannot yet distinguish between these possibilities but favour the idea that Cdc20 acts as both activator and substrate on the following evidence. Firstly, siRNA treatment shows the other APC/C activator, Cdh1, is not required for the SAC; indeed the mouse knock-out shows that Cdh1 is not required for embryonic or somatic cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>. Secondly, those motifs required for Cdc20 degradation during the checkpoint map to two classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3</xref>): the first are motifs in the Mad2-binding region (R132), and the second are the C-box and the C-terminal &#x02018;IR&#x0201d; motifs that are required for Cdc20 to bind and activate the APC/C.</p><p id="P23">We propose that ubiquitination and degradation are used to inactivate human Cdc20 and maintain the SAC, and not to turn off the checkpoint as recently proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. Although we note that the K-less Cdc20 binds more Mad2, this is probably because we increased its affinity for Mad2 by changing a conserved lysine in the Mad2 binding site of Cdc20, since an arginine was preferred in this position in a phage-display screen for Mad2-binding peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. We find no evidence that Cdc20 ubiquitination is important to inactivate the checkpoint because the K-less form of Cdc20 that cannot be ubiquitinated is able to substitute for wild-type Cdc20 to promote mitotic exit with apparently normal timing, and is not impaired in its ability to be released from either Mad2 or BubR1 when the checkpoint is turned off.</p><p id="P24">Ubiquitination and degradation cannot be the only means by which Cdc20 is inactivated since cells expressing the K-less mutant initially delay in mitosis in the presence of microtubule poisons, and they progress at a similar rate to cells with wild-type Cdc20 through unchallenged mitosis, whereas cells without a SAC are greatly accelerated through mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>. Thus, Cdc20 may initially be inactivated when it is bound by Mad2 and incorporated into the BubR1 complex, but to maintain the arrest Cdc20 must be ubiquitinated and degraded. The inactivation may be related to the way in which BubR1 binds and presents Cdc20 to the APC/C such that Cdc20 targets itself for destruction: it is unlikely that in this state Cdc20 could activate the APC/C against another substrate.</p><p id="P25">Lastly, we find that Cdc20 is continuously synthesised in mitosis to replace the protein that is degraded. Cdc20 synthesis is insensitive to rapamycin, indicating that it might be translated from an IRES. There is considerable variation in the ability of tumour cell lines to maintain a checkpoint arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> and it will be interesting to see whether this variability arises from differences in Cdc20 synthesis or degradation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Material</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS2736-supplement-1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e554" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Figure Legends</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS2736-supplement-supp.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e558" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S8"><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Daisuke Izawa for pioneering APC3 and APC11 siRNA depletion, Paola Marco for help with the BubR1 constructs, Stephen Taylor, Gowei Fang and Andrea Musacchio for reagents, Athanassios Giannis for Dimethylanastron, to Mercedes Pardo and Lu Yu of the Mass Spectroscopy group at the Sanger Centre for mass spectroscopy, and Andrea Musacchio and members of our laboratory for helpful discussions.
