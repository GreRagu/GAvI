At present, there is no drug to treat the chronic stage. In this study, we have optimized a whole cell-based assay for high throughput screening of compounds that inhibit infection of mammalian cells by <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes. A 2000-compound chemical library was screened using a recombinant <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (Tulahuen strain) expressing &#x003b2;-galactosidase. Three hits were selected for their high activity against <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and low toxicity to host cells <italic>in vitro</italic>: PCH1, NT1 and CX1 (IC<sub>50</sub>: 54, 190 and 23 nM, respectively). Each of these three compounds presents a different mechanism of action on intracellular proliferation of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> amastigotes. CX1 shows strong trypanocidal activity, an essential characteristic for the development of drugs against the chronic stage of Chagas disease where parasites are found intracellular in a quiescent stage. NT1 has a trypanostatic effect, while PCH1 affects parasite division. The three compounds also show high activity against intracellular <italic>T. cruzi</italic> from the Y strain and against the related kinetoplastid species <italic>Leishmania major</italic> and <italic>L. amazonensis</italic>. Characterization of the anti&#x02013;<italic>T. cruzi</italic> activity of molecules chemically related to the three library hits allowed the selection of two compounds with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 2 nM (PCH6 and CX2). These values are approximately 100 times lower than those of the medicines used in patients against <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. These results provide new candidate molecules for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Chagas disease is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> and affects 16 million people in South and Central America. The disease starts with an acute phase where the parasite replicates rapidly and, if it remains untreated, is followed by a chronic phase, which can induce severe pathologies including cardiac insufficiency and megacolon, leading to death. Only two drugs with high toxicity exist to treat the acute phase of the disease and no drug is available for treatment of the chronic stage. We have screened a chemical library containing 2000 compounds to find molecules that inhibit the infection of host cells by <italic>T. cruzi in vitro</italic>. We found three different families of compounds that inhibit the parasite infection very efficiently, with low toxicity to host cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. We found that two of the compounds inhibit replication of the parasites, but the third one induces complete disintegration of the parasites inside host cells. This is especially interesting for the development of new drugs against the chronic stage of the disease, where parasites are intracellular and do not replicate actively.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis is a devastating disease caused by the trypanosomatid protozoan <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>. It is endemic in 18 countries of Central and South America, putting 120 million of people at risk, with an estimated 16&#x02013;18 million people currently infected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-TDR1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The disease first manifests itself with an acute phase involving symptoms of swelling near the infection site, fever, fatigue, and enlarged lymphatic organs. It can then remain asymptomatic or manifest itself in a chronic form leading to cardiac insufficiency and megacolon. The two available drugs used to fight <italic>T. cruzi</italic> parasites during the acute stage are benznidazole (BZN) (Rochagan, Hoffmann-LaRoche) and nifurtimox (Lampit, Bayer). These drugs have toxic side effects and are not always effective. There is no drug available to treat the chronic stage of Chagas disease. Though some studies suggest that treatment with either BZN or nifurtimox decreases parasite load and slows disease progression, treatment of the chronic stage with these compounds is not officially recommended <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Tarleton1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>T. cruzi</italic> cases predominate in South America, but as migrant numbers increase in the USA, Canada and Europe, Chagas disease becomes a more widely spread public health problem, especially because BZN and nifurtimox are not approved by the countries' respective regulatory agencies and disease can be transmitted by contaminated blood donations. A need for development of new anti-<italic>T. cruzi</italic> compounds targeting the acute and/or chronic stages of the disease is therefore urgent.</p><p>The <italic>T. cruzi</italic> life cycle requires both an insect and a mammalian host. In the latter, the parasite development involves two stages: the amastigote form (intracellular parasites actively dividing within the cytoplasm of infected cells) and the trypomastigote form (free motile parasites that are released upon cell rupture into the blood and are able to infect cells) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-DeSouza1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Compounds with curative properties will be efficient if they target either free trypomastigotes to inhibit the re-invasion of new cells, or intracellularly dividing amastigotes to prevent the release of new infective parasites.</p><p><italic>Leishmania</italic> is a kinetoplastid parasite releated to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and the causative agent of leishmaniasis, a disease whose manifestations in humans range from mild cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesions to fatal visceral infections. Among the many species responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis, <italic>L. major</italic> of the Old World, is prevalent in Europe, Asia and Africa and <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> of the New World, extends from Southern Texas in North America to Brazil in South America. These two species diverged from each other 40&#x02013;80 million years ago, leading to significant differences in host-parasite interactions and hence response to drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Minodier1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Human infection initiates with the bite of a sandfly that deposits non-dividing metacyclic promastigotes into the host skin. The parasites are then taken up by professional phagocytes, differentiate to obligate intracellular amastigotes and multiply within an acidified phagolysosome, known as the parasitophorous vacuole. They eventually rupture the cell and spread further to uninfected cells. Therefore effective drugs should target the intravacuolar dividing parasites. Pentavalent antimony is still widely used to treat leishmaniasis, but drug resistance has appeared. Currently, the efficacy of liposomal Amphotericin B injected in mono- and combination therapies is being evaluated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Chappuis1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and has displayed 90&#x00025; of cure rates in combination with oral Miltefosine for visceral disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Sundar1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, some cutaneous leishmaniasis are refractory and other drug treatments have 50&#x00025; cure rates.</p><p>Screening libraries of chemical compounds against a standardized highly reproducible simple assay, or high throughput screening (HTS), offers an important tool in accelerating the discovery of new leads against parasitic diseases. This strategy's rationale is based on the assumption that screening of molecules with drug-like properties and highly diverse three-dimensional structures could allow the discovery of attractive new targets.</p><p>A transgenic <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strain expressing the reporter enzyme &#x003b2;-galactosidase (&#x003b2;-gal), also named LacZ, from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> has been engineered by Buckner <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Buckner1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This strain allows simple detection of parasite growth by measuring the &#x003b2;-gal activity, which correlates with parasite numbers. Other parasites expressing &#x003b2;-gal, such as <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, have been effectively used for screening compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-McFadden1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Seeber1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Substitution of the pyridine ring with a <italic>para</italic>-bromophenyl group as in <bold>PCH4</bold> also abolished activity, further reinforcing the importance of an <italic>ortho</italic>-nitrogen within the ring. Modifications to the chlorophenyl group explored the role of chloride substituents on this ring. Removal of the chloride at the <italic>ortho</italic> position as in <bold>PCH5</bold> did not alter the effect, whereas removal of the <italic>meta</italic>-chloride as in <bold>PCH6</bold> actually resulted in more potent inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2.1 nM). Whereas repositioning the <italic>ortho</italic>-chloride of <bold>PCH1</bold> to the <italic>para</italic> position as in <bold>PCH7</bold> did not affect the effect, replacing this chloride with a methoxy group as in <bold>PCH8</bold> gave poorer inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.6 &#x000b5;M), indicating that electron-donating and/or steric properties are detrimental at this position. Combinations of modifications to the pyridine and chlorophenyl rings in <bold>PCH9</bold> and <bold>PCH10</bold> resulted in decreased efficacy; however, comparison of <bold>PCH10</bold> to the other <italic>meta</italic>-pyridine derivative <bold>PCH2</bold> again indicates that improved inhibition results from removal of the <italic>meta</italic>-chloride substituent, as was observed with <bold>PCH1</bold> and <bold>PCH6</bold>.</p><p>Chemical variations of <bold>NT1</bold> maintained the 2-nitrotriazole moiety of the parent while containing modifications in the linker, nitrophenyl and trifluorotoluyl groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000384-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). These modifications include the removal of the latter aromatic ring as in <bold>NT2</bold> or replacement with a pyridine ring as in <bold>NT3</bold>, reintroduction of a substituent <italic>meta</italic> to the oxygen (<bold>NT4</bold>), removal of the nitrophenyl ring as in <bold>NT5</bold> or introduction of another electron-withdrawing substituent as in <bold>NT6</bold> and <bold>NT7</bold> or increasing the linker length between the nitrotriazole and carboxamide group and placing the trifluoromethyl group of <bold>NT8</bold> at the <italic>ortho</italic> ring position as in <bold>NT9</bold>.

To this aim, we optimized a simple and straight-forward assay that allows the HTS of compounds against <italic>T. cruzi</italic> replicating within mammalian cells. We tested 2000 compounds from the DIVERSet chemical library. This compound library has been useful to discover inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in a whole cell assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Nair1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and to find inhibitors of the ribonucleic activity of angiogenin using a cell-free system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Kao1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, to our knowledge this is the first time this library has been used to discover new anti-microbials.</p><p>After screening the 2000 compounds, 70 confirmed hits (3.5&#x00025;) were obtained. The rate of hits was relatively high, probably due to two main reasons: (1) the high concentration of compounds used for primary screening (25 &#x000b5;g/ml) and (2) because any compounds that are toxic to mammalian cells would also be scored as hits in this experimental design, since they would affect the host cells that are required for parasite replication. After a secondary screening to eliminate these false positive hits and select the most effective compounds, three potential candidates (0.15&#x00025; of all compounds) were identified that were active in the nanomolar range at the stage of intracellular replication of the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> parasites.</p><p>The three hits we selected had IC<sub>50</sub> values in the low-nanomolar range and low toxicity on mammalian cells. Although HepG2 cells have a limited drug metabolism activity to assess toxicity of metabolites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Castell1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, they are a useful model as a primary toxicity screen due to their human origin and ease of use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-MerschSundermann1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, although the selected hits had IC<sub>50</sub> values in the low-nanomolar range when tested on intracellular replication of parasites, they were only active on free trypomastigotes at higher concentrations that were similar to or above the TC<sub>50</sub> on mammalian cells. Therefore, it appears that our screening assay favors the selection of drugs that are effective against intracellular replication of parasites but not active on free trypomastigotes. This is probably a consequence of adding compounds and trypomastigotes simultaneously to host cells, a procedure that would not allow enough time for compounds with activity against free trypomastigotes to prevent completely invasion of host cells.</p><p>One of the compounds that we have investigated, <bold>NT1</bold>, has an IC<sub>50</sub> of 190 nM on the &#x003b2;-gal <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strain. <bold>NT1</bold> also displayed activity on the Y strain, but at higher concentrations. Interestingly, when tested against <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> <bold>NT1</bold> had a dose-dependant anti-leishmanial effect on the intracellular form of the parasites. <bold>NTI</bold> was potent against <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> with an estimated IC<sub>50</sub> of &#x0223c;500 nM.</p><p>This compound inhibited <italic>T. cruzi</italic> amastigote replication within host cells, but we did not observe amastigote lysis at 2&#x02013;3 days. Its effect might therefore be more trypanostatic than trypanocidal. The toxicity of <bold>NT1</bold> on mammalian cells was between 40- and 159-fold depending on the type of mammalian cells and the duration of the cytotoxicity assay. This is a relatively high toxicity and might therefore be an issue for further development of this compound.</p><p><bold>NT1</bold> is chemically similar to BZN in that they both contain an acetamide group linked to a nitro-substituted, heteroaromatic five-membered ring (triazole and imidazole, respectively). <bold>NT1</bold> is also chemically related to the approved anti-fungal agent fluconazole, as it contains a triazole ring, of which fluconazole has two. Fluconazole has an IC<sub>50</sub> against <italic>T. cruzi in vitro</italic> of 8 &#x000b5;M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Buckner1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Goad1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, but its activity in mice models of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection has not been confirmed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Campos1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, fluconazole has been used with some success against cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by <italic>L. major</italic>, although some geographically distinct species such as <italic>L. tropica</italic> are refractory.</p><p>Upon testing of chemical analogues of <bold>NT1</bold> that preserve the nitrotriazole moiety but include a variety of aryl and aryl ether substituents, we found that these variations did not modify strongly the anti-trypanosomal effect. It is therefore likely that the pharmacophore is the nitrotriazole group acting through a non-targeted mechanism, like BZN.</p><p>Another compound identified in the initial screen, <bold>CX1</bold>, possesses imidazole and phenyl rings, similar to BZN but without a nitro substituent on the imidazole group and with chloride and methyl groups on the phenyl ring (i.e., 4-chloro-3,5-xylenol). It is not clear whether <bold>CX1</bold> and BZN share the same target in <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. Comparison of the anti-<italic>T. cruzi</italic> activity of <bold>CX1</bold> and BZN side by side revealed that the IC<sub>50</sub> of <bold>CX1</bold> is 50 times lower than that of BZN (23 nM versus 1.15 &#x000b5;M). <bold>CX1</bold>'s dose effect on the Y strain of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> was similar to the &#x003b2;-gal-expressing Tulahuen strain, suggesting that the IC<sub>50</sub> is close for the two strains. Additionally, intracellular <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> are sensitive <bold>CX1</bold>. Indeed, it significantly reduced the <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> parasite burden by 70&#x00025; at a concentration of 2 &#x000b5;M, and had estimated IC<sub>50</sub> of &#x0223c;500 nM against both pathogens.</p><p>Numerous studies have been performed trying to modify imidazole derivatives to decrease their toxicity profile, which, for compounds such as BZN, is the cause of severe side effects when used for treatment in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Castro1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The toxicity of <bold>CX1</bold> <italic>in vitro</italic> was over 500-fold greater than the IC<sub>50</sub> suggesting that this compound may be developed into a therapeutic drug. However, as <bold>CX1</bold> is an amphiphilic compound, its cardiotoxicity will need to be evaluated carefully <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Finlayson1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, this compound induced effective lysis of intracellular amastigotes, showing a strong trypanocidal activity. While trypanostatic drugs, such as <bold>NT1</bold>, may be more effective against the acute phase of disease, where parasites replicate rapidly, inducing lysis like <bold>CX1</bold> does might be essential for the development of drugs against the chronic stage of Chagas disease, where parasites are found in a quiescent intracellular state.</p><p>Finally, <bold>PCH1</bold> is characterized by a central hydrazide moiety that bridges a pyridine ring on the carbonyl side and furan and chlorophenyl rings on the nitrogen end. We observed that the position of the nitrogen in <italic>ortho</italic> within the ring is crucial for the effect, as well as the removal of the <italic>meta</italic>-chloride substituent. The hydrazide compound <bold>PCH1</bold> induced major changes in amastigote morphology, such as presence of larger amastigotes in which replication of DNA-containing organelles took place, but normal cytokinesis into daughter cells was abnormal. Several compounds that affect epimastigotes replication, such as the vinca alkaloids agents vincristine and vinblastine present a similar phenotype, with formation of giant cells containing multiple nuclei and kinetoplasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Grellier1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The microtubule stabilizing agent taxol also inhibits cell division, but, unlike treatment with <bold>PCH1</bold>, the parasites retain a normal nucleus/kinetoplast relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Baum1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. At higher doses, <bold>PCH1</bold> however had a trypanolytic effect. Moreover, <bold>PCH1</bold> was found to have a deleterious effect on intracellular <italic>L. major</italic> with an estimated IC<sub>50</sub> of &#x0223c;2 &#x000b5;M and was more potent against <italic>L. amazonensis</italic>, which replicates in a large communal phagolysosome, with an estimated IC<sub>50</sub> of &#x0223c;100 nM. As hydrazide groups are problematic in a compound because of the possibility of release causing toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000384-Blair1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, attempts to replace this group with a bioisostere should be made during chemical optimization.</p><p>In conclusion, HTS assays are a good tool to identify new compounds with anti-kinetoplastid activity. In this study, we found three new compounds, all possessing hydrophobic groups including multiple aromatic rings, at least one of which being nitrogen-substituted. It is apparent that the most important feature of the three highly effective compounds is the presence of hydrophobic, aromatic moieties. However, it is further apparent that electronic effects also serve a critical role. Despite the chemical similarities observed, the different phenotypic changes induced by each compound suggest that they are affecting different pathways in the intracellular parasites. As we have demonstrated their efficacy <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is now critical to determine their toxicity in animals and their efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic> to assess their potential as therapeutic agents against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0000384.s001"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S1</label><caption><p>Translation of the Abstract into Spanish by Ana Rodriguez</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0000384.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0000384.s002"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>(0.11 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0000384.s002.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. B.
