Pain is defined as &#x0201c;an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage&#x0201d; (IASP 1986). Factors often associated with the development of long lasting pain include previous pain experiences, injuries, high age, female gender, and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ndt-4-1245">Radanov et al 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ndt-4-1245">Cote et al 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ndt-4-1245">Kyhlback et al 2002</xref>). In western countries, an increase in chronic pain patients has paralleled an increase in costs. Swedish studies have shown that 40%&#x02013;50% of the population is estimated to suffer from persistent pain and that the majority experience musculoskeletal pain. The country&#x02019;s total costs for chronic pain are estimated to 87.5 billion SEK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ndt-4-1245">SCTA 2006</xref>). In this context, it is worth noticing that patients with chronic pain constitute a heterogeneous group with different backgrounds, personalities, and causes of pain that may influence the clinical characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ndt-4-1245">Borg et al 2006</xref>).</p><p>Traffic injuries and especially whiplash injuries are a common cause of long lasting pain. During the last decade, the incidence of these injuries seems to have increased and varies from 1.0 to 3.2/1000 and year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ndt-4-1245">Barnsley et al 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ndt-4-1245">Sterner et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ndt-4-1245">Rodriquez et al 2004</xref>). The term whiplash describes a mechanism of energy caused by acceleration being transferred to the neck that results in soft tissue injury/distortion of the neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ndt-4-1245">Spitzer et al 1995</xref>). Although many patients with whiplash injuries recover within a few months after an accident, a significant proportion continues to suffer from a number of clinical long-lasting symptoms known as whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ndt-4-1245">Spitzer et al 1995</xref>) with neck pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ndt-4-1245">Radanov et al 1995</xref>) and headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ndt-4-1245">Radanov et al 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ndt-4-1245">Herrstrom et al 2000</xref>) as the dominating complaints. Patients may also suffer from symptoms such as post-traumatic stress, depression and anxiety, symptoms that can affect recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ndt-4-1245">Andersson et al 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ndt-4-1245">Bryant et al 1999</xref>). In a large cohort study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ndt-4-1245">Carroll and colleagues (2006)</xref> examined the duration of depressive symptoms in whiplash patients. They found that patients frequently reported these symptoms in the acute phase and the symptoms often persisted one year after the injury.</p><p>Moreover, in several studies post-traumatic stress reactions have been shown after traffic accidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ndt-4-1245">Kuch et al 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ndt-4-1245">Andersson et al 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ndt-4-1245">Jaspers et al 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ndt-4-1245">Taylor et al 2001</xref>) and a large proportion of chronic whiplash patients are expected to suffer from post-traumatic stress. The diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder has been reported in 10%&#x02013;30% of patients injured in vehicle accidents. Although the severity of the post-traumatic stress complaints decreases with time, Mayou and colleagues (2001) have shown that about one-third of traffic victims still suffer from post-traumatic stress reactions with anxiety and avoidance behavior 4&#x02013;6 years after the accident. These problems have been noticed by the Swedish Society of Medicine and the Whiplash Commission task force. This task force recently declared that post-traumatic stress symptoms should be diagnosed and treated early after a whiplash injury to minimize the risk for long-lasting symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ndt-4-1245">SSM 2005</xref>).</p><p>The Pain Rehabilitation Clinic at the University Hospital, Ume&#x000e5;, Sweden, provides multidisciplinary assessment and rehabilitation for patients with chronic pain.</p><p>Although validated questionnaires monitoring pain intensity, anxiety and depression are used routinely before the assessment, there is no systematic evaluation of posttraumatic stress. The aims of the present pilot-study were therefore to: (i) investigate the pain intensity, levels of post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression in patients with injury-related chronic pain; (ii) to assess the relationships between these symptoms; (iii) to examine differences in post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression and pain intensity between men and women and between patients with whiplash injuries and other causes to their trauma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and procedures</title><p>In total, 160 patients (103 women and 57 men, aged 17&#x02013;62 years (36 &#x000b1; 10) were admitted for assessment to the Pain Rehabilitation Clinic at the Ume&#x000e5; University Hospital, Ume&#x000e5;, Sweden, because of chronic pain caused by an injury between September 2005 and November 2007. Out of all the participants, 68% suffered from pain caused by whiplash injuries and 32% reported that their pain was caused by other accidents such as falls and assaults. The time between injury and assessment was 5.2 &#x000b1; 5.7 years.</p><p>A set of questionnaires was sent to the participants before the assessment in the clinic.

It is a valid measure of post-traumatic stress reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ndt-4-1245">Sundin and Horowitz 2002</xref>;Joseph 2003) and has been suggested as a screening tool for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The IES comprises 15 statements. Seven statements address intrusive symptoms and eight statements address avoidance symptoms. The patients answer the questionnaire regarding their symptoms during the previous week. A total score can vary from 0 to 80 and the score is divided into four grades or stress reactions: sub-clinical (0&#x02013;8), mild (9&#x02013;25), moderate (26&#x02013;43) to severe (44&#x02013;75) stress reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ndt-4-1245">Kongstd et al 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Visual analogue scale</title><p>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ndt-4-1245">Scrimshaw and Maher 2001</xref>) was used to rate the pain intensity.

In the present study, 48% of the participants suffered from moderate to severe stress which is classified as distinct stress response according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ndt-4-1245">Kongsted and colleagues (2007)</xref> and a mild stress response was observed in 52%, which is clearly higher than previous results reported in whiplash patients (mild stress response in 87%, distinct stress in 13%) early after injury (within 10 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ndt-4-1245">Kongsted et al 2007</xref>). Post-traumatic stress expressed as total IES score was also high in comparison with previous results of traffic victims with post-traumatic stress disorder late after injury (43.8 months) (Kuplich et al 2007). No difference, however, was found regarding post-traumatic stress scores between patients with whiplash injuries and patients with other injuries, a finding that might be explained by the underestimation of the rate of post-traumatic stress after injuries. Despite the fact that post-traumatic stress complaints often decrease over time after the injury, the post-traumatic stress levels in our study more than five years after the trauma were fairly high and seem to agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ndt-4-1245">Mayou and colleagues (2000)</xref> who found that about one-third of traffic victims still suffer from post-traumatic stress reactions with anxiety and avoidance behaviour up to six years after the accident.</p></sec><sec><title>Anxiety and depression</title><p>More than 40% of the participants fulfilled the criteria for possible/probable depression or anxiety disorder according to the HAD scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ndt-4-1245">Zigmond and Snaith 1983</xref>), which is clearly higher than previous studies have found in patients with whiplash injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ndt-4-1245">Wenzel et al 2002</xref>). The anxiety scores were also much higher than in an uninjured Swedish population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ndt-4-1245">Lisspers et al 1997</xref>) and slightly higher than in a previous study on chronic pain patients from our clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ndt-4-1245">Branstrom and Fahlstrom 2008</xref>). Although women scored higher on HAD anxiety than men, the difference was not significant. In addition, there were no differences when comparing depression scores between men and women. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference between patients with a whiplash injury and other injuries.</p><p>A previous study has correlated post-traumatic stress both with anxiety and depression in patients with chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ndt-4-1245">Gayle Beck et al 2003</xref>). In the present study, this relationship was only shown between total post-traumatic score on the IES and HAD-anxiety. There is no clear reason for this result since the level of HAD-depression in our study was fairly high. However, we cannot rule out that the participant&#x02019;s personal characteristics might influence the results.</p></sec><sec><title>Pain intensity</title><p>In the present study, patients rated pain intensity on VAS. The mean scores were high in comparison with previous studies of whiplash patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ndt-4-1245">Berglund et al 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ndt-4-1245">Bunketorp et al 2006</xref>). Although women reported higher scores than men, the difference was not significant. The mean VAS scores for all patients were slightly lower than previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ndt-4-1245">Becker and colleagues (2000)</xref> in a sample of patients with both injury and non-injury related chronic pain before treatment, however, the VAS scores were clearly higher than patients with strictly injury-related chronic pain who were referred to a pain rehabilitation programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ndt-4-1245">Roth et al 2008</xref>). Pain intensity was significantly related to post-traumatic stress as well as to depression and anxiety. These findings agree with a recently published study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ndt-4-1245">Roth and colleagues (2008)</xref>. They found that depressive symptoms directly influenced pain intensity and unresolved post-traumatic stress symptoms contributed to the level of depression and pain in patients with accident-related chronic pain. Relationships between pain, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms have also been shown in some previous studies, and it has been proposed that in patients with chronic pain after accidents that these symptoms may co-exist and interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ndt-4-1245">Bryant 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ndt-4-1245">McCauley et al
