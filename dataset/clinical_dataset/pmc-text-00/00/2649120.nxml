Proteins acting on carbohydrates and proteins of unknown function constituted the two most abundant classes. Other proteins were proteases, oxido-reductases, proteins with interacting domains, proteins involved in signalling, and structural proteins. Particularly high levels of expression were established for genes encoding pectin methylesterases, germin-like proteins, arabinogalactan proteins, fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins, and structural proteins.

They contain a large proportion of cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Cell walls play different roles in growth, development and transportation of nutrients and water. They also provide a mechanical support for plants as well as an efficient protection against environmental stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Cell walls mainly consist of large biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectins and lignins. The structure and composition of these polymers vary during development not only between different tissues of the same plant, but also from one plant to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although plant cell walls are mainly composed of carbohydrates and lignins, cell wall proteins (CWPs) make up approximately 10% of their mass. CWPs can become <italic>N</italic>- and/or <italic>O</italic>-glycosylated during their transit through the secretory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A recent proteomic analysis using ConA sepharose affinity chromatography on <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>stems showed that the majority of the trapped proteins were predicted to be secreted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, some CWPs receive a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Classical approaches for the study and identification of CWPs are based on cell wall purification, protein extraction, separation by electrophoresis and identification of proteins by mass spectrometry. Many proteomic analyses were performed on <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>cell suspension cultures or organs including roots, stems, leaves and etiolated hypocotyls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. To better understand the biological processes encompassed by the proteins identified by proteomic approaches, CWPs were classified according to their known or predicted functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>However, several problems are encountered during extraction, detection and identification of CWPs by proteomic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It means that all available cell wall proteomes are actually sub-proteomes. On the other hand, they only provide information on extracellular proteins. All the intracellular proteins as well as many membrane proteins contributing to cell wall biogenesis are not taken into consideration.</p><p>The availability of the complete sequences of several plant genomes allowed the development of transcriptomic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Global gene expression as well as regulation at different physiological stages or in response to changes in the environment can be analyzed. The expression patterns of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genes that are supposed to be involved in cell wall dynamics were analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Molecular events involved in the transition from primary to secondary growth were studied in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and hybrid aspen trees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis of cell wall components, cell death proteins, transporters, cytoskeleton-interacting proteins, and transcription factors were identified. Finally, the expression of over 1600 genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) was analyzed in <italic>Populus trichocarpa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>This work describes the identification of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genes expressed at different developmental stages of stems. The aims were (i) to get an overview of the transcriptional activity of genes possibly involved in cell wall biogenesis and of genes encoding cell wall proteins; (ii) to compare the results from this transcriptome analysis to those of a previous proteomic analysis performed on the same material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. New genes that are possibly involved in cell wall biogenesis during stem elongation were identified and the importance of post-transcriptional events in regulation of genes encoding CWPs was shown.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In order to analyse the expression pattern of genes encoding CWPs, Complete <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>Transcriptome MicroArrays (CATMAs) were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. CATMA contains 24,576 Gene Specific Tags (GSTs) for known or predicted genes. Three developmental stages of stems were studied: young elongating stems, intermediate stage, and mature stems as described in Methods. In stems, two biological processes are of high importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Cell elongation and synthesis of primary cell walls occur until the final size of the stems is reached. At the same time, differentiation of conducting tissues occurs. Some vessels at the bottom of young stems already have thickened cell walls and lignin deposition is starting. First signs of fiber differentiation appear at the intermediate stage while thickened secondary cell walls undergo lignification. In both cases, synthesis of cell wall components as well as their rearrangements are major events.</p><sec><title>1. Sugar composition of stems at various stages of development</title><p>Cell wall polysaccharide biogenesis includes polymer synthesis, secretion, assembly, and rearrangement during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Consequently, the sugar composition of the cell wall polysaccharides is in relation with development stage of the cells. For this reason analysis of sugar composition of cell wall materials from stems of three developmental stages were performed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This analysis was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The results revealed a drastic increase in Xyl amount from young elongating to mature stems. Little or no significant changes in the amounts of the other sugars were observed. These results strongly suggested that xylan is mostly deposited at intermediate and mature stages of stem development.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Monosaccharide composition of cell walls from three development stages: young, intermediate and mature stems</bold>. <bold>A</bold>: Monosaccharide composition was determined as described in Methods. <bold>B</bold>: HPAEC elution profile of the endo-xylanase-generated fragments obtained from alcali-extracted polymer of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>stems. <bold>C</bold>: MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of acidic oligoxylan products generated by the endo-xylanase digestion of the alkali-extracted polylmer of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>stems.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2229-9-6-1"/></fig><p>In order to confirm the presence of xylan and to determine its structure, additional analyses were performed. The alcohol-insoluble material from <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>mature stems was sequentially extracted with ammonium oxalate, 1 M and 4 M KOH. The glycosidic composition of these three fractions was determined by gas chromatography. Analysis of the ammonium oxalate extract revealed the presence of GalA, Ara, Rha, and Gal suggesting that this fraction was mainly composed of pectic material. In contrast, Xyl was the main monosaccharide (&#x0003e; 90%) of the 1 M and 4 M KOH extracts, together with small amount of Glc and traces of other sugars including GlcA and 4-<italic>O</italic>-methyl glucuronic acid (4OMeGlcA), indicating that xylan was the main alkali-extracted polymer of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>stems.</p><p>To investigate the structure of xylan present in the alkali extracts, the fractions were treated with an endo-xylanase and the resulting fragments were analysed by High Performance Anion Exchange Chromatography-Pulse Amperometric Detection (HPAEC-PAD) and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Similar data were obtained for 1 M and 4 M KOH extracts. The HPAEC elution profile of the endo-xylanase-generated fragments indicated the presence of Xyl and xylobiose (Xyl<sub>2</sub>), as well as peaks arising from xylan-derived acidic oligosaccharides that are eluted with high concentration of sodium acetate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). For structural identification of the acidic fragments, the endo-xylanase-generated oligomers were analysed by MALDI-TOF MS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The main ion at <italic>m/z </italic>759 corresponded to the [M+Na]<sup>+ </sup>adduct of Xyl<sub>4</sub>-4OMeGlcA. The ion at <italic>m/z </italic>745 was assigned to the [M+Na]<sup>+ </sup>adduct of Xyl<sub>4</sub>-GlcA. Other ions corresponded to [M+2Na-H]<sup>+ </sup>and [M+Na+K-H]<sup>+ </sup>adducts of the two acidic xylan fragments. These data are in agreement with recent results reported in papers describing the biosynthesis of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>xylan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Acidic fragments were isolated and were analysed by proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR, not illustrated). By comparison with previous NMR data on glucuronoxylan fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the spectrum was fully in agreement with the presence of a mixture of a &#x003b2;(1&#x02013;4)-linked xylopyranose residues regularly substituted on C-2 by &#x003b1;-4OMeGlcA or &#x003b1;-GlcA in a 2/1 ratio (data not shown). The Xyl to uronic acid ratio was estimated to be about 6&#x02013;7 on the basis of the peak integration of the HPAEC profile of endo-xylanase-generated oligomers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In conclusion, these data indicated that a glucuronoxylan exhibiting a 4OMeGlcA/&#x003b1;-GlcA in a ratio of 2/1 is deposited during <italic>Arabidopis </italic>stem development and along with cellulose and lignin represents one of the main polymers in the mature stem.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Transcriptome microarrays analyses</title><p>In order to analyse the expression pattern of genes encoding CWPs, Complete <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>Transcriptome MicroArrays (CATMAs) were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. CATMA contains 24,576 Gene Specific Tags (GSTs) for known or predicted genes. Results are expressed as log<sub>2 </sub>of signal mean intensity. Expression level is considered as high when values are higher than 10, moderate for values between 9 and 10 and low for values between 9 and background level estimated at 6.42 (see Methods). In young stems, 6, 6 and 48% of the probes give signals corresponding to high, moderate and low levels of transcripts, respectively; whereas 39% of the probes give a signal lower than background. In mature stems, 5, 4 and 48% of the probes give signals corresponding to high, moderate and low levels of transcripts, respectively; whereas 42% of the probes give a signal lower than background. A modulation of level of transcripts is revealed with 2313 probes at least at one of the three stages of development. Among those, 1282 probes reveal changes during the transition from young stems to intermediate stage, and 1395 probes during the transition from intermediate stage to mature stems. This transcriptome has been analyzed in more details and is described in the following sections.</p><sec><title>2.1. Levels of transcripts of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and of genes encoding secreted proteins during stem development</title><p>The levels of transcripts of two groups of genes involved in the synthesis of cell wall components were analyzed. These genes encode intracellular proteins or proteins located at the plasma membrane (cellulose synthases). First group comprises genes encoding glycosyl transferases (GTs) involved in the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Genes from all GT families analyzed had detectable levels of transcripts in all 3 samples. The levels of transcripts of only a few genes were modulated during stem development, <italic>i.e. </italic>20 out of 101. Most remarkable changes were noted for genes encoding cellulose synthases related to secondary wall formation (<italic>CesA4</italic>, <italic>IRX5</italic>, <italic>At5g44030</italic>; <italic>CesA7</italic>, <italic>IRX3</italic>, <italic>At5g17420</italic>) and callose synthases (<italic>AtGSL6</italic>, <italic>CALS1</italic>, <italic>At1g05570</italic>; <italic>AtGSL3</italic>, <italic>At2g31960</italic>). The second group comprises genes encoding proteins putatively involved in the biosynthesis of monolignols that are lignin precursors (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). A greater proportion of genes had modulated levels of transcripts: either a decrease during the transition from young elongating stems to intermediate stage (<italic>PAL4</italic>, <italic>4CL-like1</italic>, <italic>CCR1</italic>, <italic>CAD1</italic>, <italic>CAD6</italic>, <italic>CAD7</italic>), or an increase during transitions from young elongating stems to intermediate stage (<italic>4CL2</italic>, <italic>CCoAOMT7</italic>), or intermediate stage to mature stems (<italic>PAL1</italic>, <italic>PAL3</italic>, <italic>4CH</italic>, <italic>4CL2</italic>, <italic>4CL-like1</italic>, <italic>CCoAOMT3</italic>, <italic>CCoAOMT7</italic>). This analysis revealed that synthesis of the cell wall components required for biogenesis of primary and secondary walls is an active process throughout stem development.</p><p>Genes encoding secreted proteins were sorted using bioinformatics softwares as described in Methods. Genes expressed at moderate or high level have been further annotated for experimentally proven or predicted biological functions. A total of 345 genes were classified into 8 functional categories according to Jamet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). A large proportion of the genes encode proteins with unknown functions (34.5%, 119 genes), miscellaneous functions (17.1%, 59 genes) and proteins acting on carbohydrates (14.8%, 51 genes). Other genes encode proteins predicted to be involved in signalling (11.6%, 40 genes), proteases (7%, 24 genes), proteins with interaction domains (6.7%, 23 genes), oxido-reductases (4.6%, 16 genes), and structural proteins (3.8%, 13 genes).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Repartition of genes encoding secreted proteins and having high or moderate levels of transcripts during stem development in functional classes.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Functional classes</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Percentage of genes</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Proteins acting on carbohydrates</td><td align="center">14.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Oxido-reductases</td><td align="center">4.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Proteins with interaction domains</td><td align="center">6.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Proteins involved in signaling</td><td align="center">11.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Proteases</td><td align="center">7.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Structural proteins</td><td align="center">3.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Miscellaneous proteins</td><td align="center">17.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Proteins of unknown function</td><td align="center">34.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Bioinformatic softwares were used to search for functional domains in the encoded proteins.

Fourty-five genes encoding proteins acting on carbohydrates were identified among which 42 are CAZys (Carbohydrate Active enZymes) and 6 are expansins. CAZys include glycoside hydrolases (GHs), carbohydrate esterases (CEs), and polysaccharide lyases (PLs) (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). About half of the identified GHs (24 genes) such as those belonging to GH1, GH3, GH9, GH16, GH27, GH28, GH31 and GH35 families could be involved in cell wall modification. Their substrates are assumed to be pectins (GH3, GH28, GH35), xyloglucans (GH1, GH16, GH31), or xylans, arabinoxylans and arabinans (GH3).</p><p>The most represented families are GH16, GH17, and GH1. Seven <underline>x</underline>yloglucan endo<underline>t</underline>ransglucosylase-<underline>h</underline>ydrolases (XTHs) of the GH16 family were identified. Three of them (<italic>At2g06850</italic>, <italic>At4g30290</italic>, <italic>At4g30270</italic>) were expressed at high levels in young stems and at intermediate stage, but were down-regulated in mature stems. Some XTHs have been shown to function in cell elongation by loosening of cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It has also been shown that XTHs can be involved in formation of secondary cell walls of vascular tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Seven genes of the GH17 family encoding putative &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanases were expressed at different stages of stem development. Only one was down-regulated in mature stems (<italic>At3g07320</italic>). Five of these enzymes are GPI-anchored. &#x003b2;-1,3-Glucanases catalyze the hydrolysis of &#x003b2;-1,3-glucan linkages of callose in plants, and play a role in various important physiological processes such as regulating pollen tube growth or defence against pathogen attack during fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].

The results obtained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) demonstrated the presence of all the GH activities tested at the three stages of stem development. Decreasing enzyme activities from young to mature protein extracts were observed for &#x003b2;-D-xylosidase, &#x003b1;-L-arabinofuranosidase, &#x003b2;-D-glucuronidase and &#x003b2;-D-manosidase.

Five of these genes were down-regulated in mature stems. Activities of these enzymes can cause major changes in the physical, chemical, and biological properties of pectins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. At acidic pH, demethylesterification by PMEs can promote the activity of polygalacturonases, thus contributing to cell wall loosening. On the contrary, PME activity was shown to be inversely correlated with the rate of growth of expanding tissues, suggesting possible involvement in wall rigidification. Two genes encoding polysaccharide lyases (PLs) were down-regulated either during the whole development of stems (<italic>At3g07010</italic>), or during the transition from young stems to intermediate stage (<italic>At5g48900</italic>).

The level of transcripts of all these genes has been analyzed in the stem transcriptomes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Several genes were found to be expressed throughout stem development: hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:shikinate/quinase hydrocinnamoyl transferase (<italic>HCT, At5g48930</italic>), <italic>p</italic>-coumarate 3-hydroxylase 1 (<italic>C3H, At2g40890</italic>), ferulate 5-hydroxylase (<italic>F5H, At4g36220</italic>) and caffeic acid methyltransferase (<italic>COMT, At5g54160</italic>). Changes in the level of transcripts were observed for other genes. Level of transcripts of <italic>PAL4 </italic>was higher in young stems than in mature stems, whereas levels of transcripts of <italic>PAL1 </italic>and <italic>PAL3 </italic>increased at the mature stage.

Concerning the next step of the pathway, level of transcripts of the trans-cinnamate 4-hydroxylase gene (<italic>C4H, At2g30490</italic>) was found to be higher in mature stems. Several 4-coumarate CoA ligase genes (<italic>4CL1</italic>, <italic>At1g51680</italic>; <italic>4CL2</italic>, <italic>At3g21240</italic>; <italic>4CL3</italic>, <italic>At1g65060</italic>; <italic>4CL 4, At3g21230</italic>) were shown to be involved to lignification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The increase of the level of transcripts of <italic>4CL2 </italic>during stem development could be related to this process. In contrast, nothing is known about the function of <italic>4CL-like1 </italic>(<italic>At1g20510</italic>), whose level of transcripts was found to be modulated during stem development. The levels of transcripts of caffeoyl-CoA reductase genes (<italic>CCoAOMT-3</italic>, <italic>At3g61990</italic>; <italic>CCoAOMT-7</italic>, <italic>At4g26220</italic>) strongly increased during stem development.

The level of transcripts of all the other <italic>CAD </italic>genes which have not been demonstrated to be linked to lignification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] remained the same throughout stem development. In conclusion, most genes already shown to contribute to monolignol biosynthesis were found to be expressed in stems.

Transcriptomics vs proteomics</title><p>In order to better understand gene regulation in stems, data from transcriptomics were compared to those of a previous proteomic study performed using the same biological material, <italic>i.e. </italic>mature <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>stems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This proteomic study was designed to identify <italic>N</italic>-glycoproteins trapped on ConA sepharose and allowed the identification of 90 genes encoding secreted proteins. Their levels of transcripts were searched in the stem transcriptome. Results were obtained for 72 genes on the CATMA hybridized with total RNAs from mature stems (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Eighteen genes were found to have levels of transcripts lower than background, 42 had weak levels of transcripts, 5 moderate levels of transcripts and 7 high levels of transcripts. Altogether, 25% of the genes identified through proteomics have levels of expression below background and 58% have low level of transcripts. The percentage of genes having detectable levels of expression decreases from about 82% to 75% during stem growth. The encoded proteins might have long half-lifes and remain in cell walls after the disappearance of the mRNAs. It means that transcriptomics fails to give an overall picture of proteins present in cell walls at a given time.</p><p>Conversely, only 25 genes identified through proteomics are found among the 345 genes encoding secreted proteins expressed at high or moderate level. This means that many proteins escaped this proteomic analyses. One explanation might be the partial analysis of proteins separated by 2-D electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, low abundant proteins are not usually identified in proteomic studies, and structural proteins are difficult to extract from cell walls since they form insoluble networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>]. Proteins with transmembrane domains are also not easily extracted by salts. AGPs and FLAs are difficult to identify because of their high level of glycosylation. However, these explanations are not valid for proteins like GHs that are soluble. Alternatively, the numerous proteases present in cell walls probably play a great role in protein turnover, although it was shown that glycoproteins are more resistant against digestion by proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>]. In addition, some regulatory mechanisms preventing the translation of certain mRNAs may also exist. Such discrepancies between proteomics and transcriptomics have been described in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>]. Finally, proteome and transcriptome approaches appear to be complementary to get an overview of genes expressed in developing stems. The observed discrepancies show the importance of post-transcriptional regulations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we have examined the expression patterns of the genes encoding cell wall proteins. Some of the genes identified in this work were previously identified by various microarray analyses of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>stems. These include XTH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>], 1,3-&#x003b2;-glucanase and pectin esterase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], pectate lyase, AGP, glycine rich and proline rich proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, we identified and established expression patterns of many new genes possibly involved in primary and secondary cell wall biogenesis. Many genes involved in the synthesis of cell wall components were found to be transcribed as well as many genes encoding secreted proteins. The latter genes encode proteins acting on carbohydrates, oxido-reductases, proteins with interaction domains and structural proteins. Among secreted proteins, proteins acting on carbohydrates represent the most abundant class after proteins of unknown function. In addition, genes encoding proteins such as AGP, FLAs, GRPs and PRPs not reported by proteomic analyses, had high levels of transcripts. This transcriptomic analysis allowed identification of many gene candidates that play a role in cell wall construction during stem development. Both primary and secondary walls are drastically modified thus allowing cells to undergo elongation during early steps of development. These modifications are part of the differentiation processes during late stages of development. The enzymes which catalyze glucan-chain elongation in cellulose, belonging to the family 2 of glycoside transferase (GT2), are crucial for primary and secondary wall formations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B95">95</xref>]. In plants this family of GTs, designated as the cellulose synthase catalytic subunits (CESA), has multiple members. In the present work several highly expressed genes of this family of enzymes have been identified (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Comparison of the gene expression profile of CESA genes obtained in the present study with those of GeneCAT database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genecat.mpg.de"/>) showed similar high expression profile of 7 genes with exception of <italic>At2g25540 </italic>which is not expressed according to GeneCAT database. Though good correlation in expression scores of these genes were obtained, some differences were observed concerning expression level or difference in expression. These differences could be consequences of developmental stage of plant, condition of growth, environment and from minor unavoidable experimental errors during extraction of RNAs and measurement. Finally, comparison of transcriptomic and proteomic analyses showed that about 25% of the genes encoding proteins identified by proteomics had level of transcripts above background in the CATMA analysis. Conversely, only a small proportion of genes identified by proteomics were identified by transcriptomics, <italic>i.e. </italic>only 25 out of the 339 genes encoding secreted proteins were expressed at high or moderate levels. Such discrepancies between proteomics and transcriptomics suggest complex regulatory mechanisms which occur at post-transcriptional levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material</title><p>Wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, Wassilewskija ecotype, was grown in the greenhouse at 20&#x000b0;C to 22&#x000b0;C with a 16 h-photoperiod at 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>E.m<sup>-2</sup>.s<sup>-1</sup>.

The GST amplicons were purified on Multiscreen plates (Millipore, Bedford, USA) and resuspended in TE-DMSO at 100 ng/&#x003bc;L. The purified probes were transferred to 1536-well plates with a Genesis workstation (TECAN, M&#x000e4;nnedorf, SW) and spotted on UltraGAPS slides (Corning, New York, USA) using a Microgrid II (Genomic Solution, Huntingdon, UK). The current CATMA version printed at the URGV consists of three metablocks, each composed of 64 blocks of 144 spots. A block is a set of spots printed with the same print-tip. In these arrays, a print-tip is used three times to print a block in each metablock. RNA samples for a condition were prepared by pooling RNAs from 30 plants. For each comparison, one dye-swap was performed as a technical replication with fluorochrome reversal (i.e. two hybridizations per comparison). cRNAs were produced from 2 &#x003bc;g of total RNA from each pool with the "Message Amp aRNA" kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Then 5 &#x003bc;g of cRNAs were reverse transcribed in the presence of 200 u of SuperScript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), cy3-dUTP and cy5-dUTP (NEN, Boston, MA) for each slide as described in Lurin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">97</xref>]. 30 pmol. of each labelled target sample per slide were combined, purified and concentrated with YM30 Microcon columns (Millipore, Bedford, MA) prior to hybridization. Slides were pre-hybridized for 1 h and hybridized overnight at 42&#x000b0;C in 25% formamide. Slides were prehybridized for 1 h and hybridized overnight at 42&#x000b0;C in 25% formamide.

The arrays were scanned on a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, USA) and images were analysed by GenePix Pro 3.0 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis of microarray data</title><p>Experiments were designed with the statistics group of the URGV. Statistical analysis was based on one dye swap (<italic>i.e. </italic>two arrays, each containing 24,576 GSTs and 384 controls) as described in Lurin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B96">96</xref>]. Controls were used for assessing the quality of the hybridizations, but were not included in the statistical tests or the graphic representation of the results. For each array, the raw data comprised the logarithm of median feature pixel intensity at wavelengths 635 (red) and 532 nm (green). No background was subtracted. In the following description, log ratio refers to the differential expression between two conditions. It is either log<sub>2 </sub>(red/green) or log<sub>2 </sub>(green/red) according to the experimental design. Array-by-array normalization was performed to remove systematic biases. First, we excluded spots that were considered to have badly formed features. Then, we performed global intensity-dependent normalization using the LOESS procedure to correct the dye bias. Finally, for each block, the log<sub>2 </sub>ratio median calculated over the values for the entire block was subtracted from each individual log ratio value to correct print tip effects on each metablock. To determine differentially expressed genes, we performed a paired t test on the log ratios, assuming that the variance of the log ratios were the same for all genes. Spots displaying extreme variance (too small or too large) were excluded. The raw P values were adjusted by the Bonferroni method, which controls the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER). The genes with an FWER lower than 5% were considered to be differentially expressed. We used the Bonferroni method (with a type I error equal to 5%) in order to keep a strong control of the false positives in a multiple-comparison context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">98</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Background estimation</title><p>After the normalization procedure described above, we obtained normalized ratios and intensities per sample for each dye swap. The range of the normalized log<sub>2 </sub>intensities per sample was from 0 to 16. In these data, background was not subtracted, thus we had to estimate a background level for each dye swap to get information about the hybridization level. In most transcriptomic analysis, the background is calculated by the scanner software from the pixels intensities in the spots vicinity, which underestimates dramatically the real background on the spots. For example it does not take into account the autofluorescence of the spotted DNA. Here we decided to calculate a more accurate background based on the intensity value of 1220 negative spots. These negative spots corresponded either to negative human probes or <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>probes for which the hybridization signal remained at the lowest level in more than 3000 CATMA results obtained on the URGV platform. These genes could be either very poorly expressed under the sensitivity of the array, or expressed in very specific tissues or environmental conditions. The estimated background is the sum of the average log<sub>2 </sub>intensity value of the "negative spots" plus twice their standard deviation. This value was compared to the normalized log<sub>2 </sub>intensity to get an estimation of the hybridization signal above background.</p></sec><sec><title>Data deposition</title><p>Microarray data from this article was deposited at Array-Express (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/"/>; accession E-MEXP-802) and CATdb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://urgv.evry.inra.fr/CATdb/"/>; Project AF09-Lignin) according to the "Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment" standards.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR validation</title><p>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR validation was performed for 13 genes on the samples described in the microarray section.

The primer pairs were first tested on a dilution series of genomic DNA (5 ng, 0.5 ng, 0.05 ng, 0.005 ng) to generate a standard curve and assess their PCR efficiency, which ranged between 90% and 99%. Reverse transcription was performed on 1 &#x003bc;g of total RNA with an oligodT primer (18 mer) and the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), for 1 hr at 42&#x000b0;C in 40 &#x003bc;L.

Quantitative PCR reactions were performed in 15 &#x003bc;l, with 0.1 &#x003bc;l ng of RT reaction, 900 nM final concentration of each primer pair, and SYBRGreen PCR master mix 2X (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium).
