Considerable evidence has shown that TGF&#x003b2;1 and 2 are potent profibrotic molecules that have been implicated in numerous fibrotic diseases including diabetic nephropathy, liver and pulmonary fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and more recently, ocular fibrotic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>].</p><p>Ocular pathologies associated with aberrant levels of active TGF&#x003b2; include cataracts, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), as well as glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. The active form of TGF&#x003b2; has been detected in the ocular media from patients suffering with cataracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>] and in patients undergoing intraocular lens implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Moreover, patients treated with TGF&#x003b2;2 to treat retinal macular holes all developed cataracts after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Two specific types of cataracts are associated with elevated levels of activated TGF&#x003b2;, including anterior subcapsular cataracts (ASC) and posterior capsular opacification (PCO), also known as secondary cataract.</p><p>In ASC, focal opacities develop beneath the lens capsule in the anterior region of the lens. These opacities or plaques have been shown to be derived from an aberrant proliferation of lens epithelial cells (LECs). A proportion of these cells also undergo a transition into myofibroblasts, which express alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;SMA), through a mechanism known as epithelial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. As the cataracts further develop, the plaque cells secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) components not found in the normal lens, such as collagen type I and IV, contributing to the loss of lens transparency. PCO remains the major complication of modern cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. In PCO, the LECs which remain within the capsule after cataract surgery are triggered to proliferate and migrate to the posterior lens capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>] and like ASC, some of these cells undergo a transition into myofibroblasts that secrete aberrant ECM.</p><p>Multiple in vitro and in vivo rodent models have been developed for studying the mechanism(s) of TGF&#x003b2;-induced ASC. In vitro models include excised rat lenses, lens epithelial explants and cell cultures that when exposed to TGF&#x003b2; undergo morphological changes similar to that seen in human ASC including LEC transformation and inappropriate ECM deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Ectopic expression of active TGF&#x003b2;1 in the lens of transgenic mice under the transcriptional control of the &#x003b1;A-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>] or &#x003b2;B-crystallin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>] promoter also results in ASC plaques that resemble those observed in humans. More recently, two in vivo injury models for ASC have been developed in mice including direct injury to the lens with a hypodermic needle, as well as an alkali burn to the ocular surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. In both of these models LECs are stimulated to undergo EMT through activation of TGF&#x003b2;2. While the TGF&#x003b2; signaling intermediate, Smad3, was shown to be required for the EMT observed in the lens injury model, in the alkali burn model both EMT and ASC were shown to occur in the absence of Smad3, albeit the effect was attenuated. Similarly, our lab has shown that when the lens specific-TGF&#x003b2;1 transgenic mice were bred onto the Smad3 knockout mouse background, small ASC formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Thus, multiple models have shown that alternative TGF&#x003b2; signaling pathways participate in the development of ASC.</p><p>Our group has shown that transient overexpression of bioactive TGF&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;3 using adenoviral vectors results in accumulation of parenchymal extracellular matrix and EMT of epithelial cells, as demonstrated by increased expression of &#x003b1;SMA in both the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>] and in the peritoneum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Moreover, we have shown that adenoviral transfer of TGF&#x003b2;1 produces transgene detectable by RNAse protection assay, ELISA and a functional reporter assay, confirming transgene activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. We posited whether adenoviral transfer of TGF&#x003b2;1 to the anterior segment of the rodent eye could be used to induce EMT of LECs and create a novel model of ASC that would not require injury or developmental expression of a TGF&#x003b2; transgene. Using adenoviral-LacZ (AdLacZ) we have shown successful adenoviral transduction of a number of tissues within the anterior segment of the eye, including the lens epithelium. We further demonstrate that transfer of adenoviral-(active) TGF&#x003b2;1 (AdTGF&#x003b2;1) to cells of the rodent anterior segment resulted in the development of ASC plaques, within 4 days of injection, which continued to progress into large fibrotic plaques by day 21. Finally, we employed this new model to show that delivery of AdTGF&#x003b2;1 to the anterior chamber of genetically modified mice deficient in Smad3, results in the formation of ASC plaques, confirming our earlier findings that Smad3-independent signaling mechanisms participate in the EMT of LECs in ASC formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Recombinant adenoviruses</title><p>Full-length porcine TGF&#x003b2;1 cDNA was mutated at serines 223 and 225 (TGF&#x003b2;1<sup>223/225</sup>) to render the expressed protein product constitutively and biologically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. This mutated cDNA was used to construct a recombinant, replication-deficient type-5 adenovirus. The E1 region was replaced by the human cytomegalovirus promoter, driving expression of TGF&#x003b2;1<sup>223/225</sup> followed by the SV40 polyadenylation signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. The resulting replication-deficient virus (AdTGF&#x003b2;1) was amplified and purified by cesium chloride (CsCl) gradient centrifugation and concentrated using a Sephadex PD-10 chromatography column, and finally plaque-titered on 293 cells. The control vectors, AdDL, with no insert in the deleted E1 region, or adenoviral vector expressing the &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene (AdLacZ), coding for &#x003b2;-galactosidase, or adenoviral vector expressing GFP (AdGFP), were produced by similar methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Animal treatment</title><p>All animals were treated in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and according to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Female, 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 and FVB/n mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Montreal, PQ, Canada). Smad3 knockout mice were generated by the removal of exon 8 of the Smad3 gene in mice of background 129SV/EV x C57BL/6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Smad3 heterozygous mice were bred under special pathogen-free conditions. The genotypes of both wildtype (WT) and Smad3 knockout (Smad3KO) mice were determined by PCR analysis on tail DNA obtained from 3-wk-old animals. Tail biopsies were digested overnight at 65 &#x000b0;C in buffer containing 0.1 M TrisHCl (pH 8.5), 5 mM EDTA (pH 8), 0.2% SDS, 200 mM NaCl and 0.2 mg/ml Proteinase K (Bioshop Canada, Burlington, ON). Digested samples were spun down and supernatants were mixed with 100% ethanol to precipitate genomic DNA, which was then diluted in 100 &#x003bc;l of sterile distilled water. Primer sequences were as follows: S3P1 5'-CCA CTT CAT TGC CAT ATG CCC TG-3'; S3P2 5'-CCC GAA CAG TTG GAT TCA CAC A-3'; S3P3 5'-CCA GAC TGC CTT GGG AAA AGC-3'. The wild type allele was generated using primers S3P1 and S3P2 giving a 400 bp fragment; the knockout allele was generated using primers S3P1 and S3P3 giving a 250 bp fragment. PCR product was run on a 2% TAE agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining under UV light. All experiments were performed with littermates to rule out any background effects. All animals were housed under specific pathogen free conditions and rodent laboratory food and water were provided ad libitum. All animal procedures were performed under inhalation anesthesia with isofluorane (MTC Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, ON, Canada). AdTGF&#x003b2;1 or AdDL or AdLacZ (5x10<sup>8</sup> pfu) were administered in a volume of 5 &#x003bc;l phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and placed under a dissecting microscope, in order to visualize general eye structures. A volume of no more than 5 &#x003bc;l of virus solution was injected into the anterior chamber using a 33 gauge needle affixed to a 10 &#x003bc;l Hamilton syringe. Eyes were covered with Lacri-lube&#x000ae; after injection and animals were allowed to recover before returning to their cages. Animals were sacrificed and enucleated 4 or 21 days after injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology</title><p>After fixation in 10% buffered formalin for 48 h, tissues were embedded in paraffin by routine methods. Three-micrometer thick midsagittal sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to visualize general tissue architecture.

Immunohistochemistry using an antibody against &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;SMA, clone 1A4; DakoCytomation, Mississauga, ON) was used to localize contractile elements. The brown color reaction was performed with the Animal Research Kit (DakoCytomation, Mississauga, ON). Studies to fluorescently colocalize &#x003b1;SMA employed a monoclonal antibody conjugated to FITC (clone 1A4; Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON).

LacZ staining was then performed to localize transgene expression. Grossly, LacZ positive eyes could be distinguished from eyes injected with control virus containing no transgene (AdDL) simply by the bluish corneal opacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>) in contrast to the clear corneas of the AdDL-treated mice. Histological midsagittal sections of AdLacZ treated eyes revealed that after 4 days, LacZ staining was observed in multiple structures of the anterior chamber, including the corneal endothelium, iris, ciliary body and trabecular meshwork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Transgene was also detectable in the lens epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>) in absence of capsular break, but typically at the higher dose (1x10<sup>9</sup> pfu). Animals injected with the AdDL vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>) did not show any LacZ staining. Transduction of lens epithelial cells was also confirmed by expression of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E</xref>) after intracameral injection with AdGFP.

Four days post injection, 13 lenses out of 15 eyes treated with AdTGF&#x003b2;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>) showed distinct ASC plaques consisting of a focal multilayering of LECs beneath the intact anterior lens capsule. Each of the AdTGF&#x003b2;1-treated eyes commonly exhibited one plaque, typically found in a central location of the anterior region of the lens. In comparison to those treated with AdTGF&#x003b2;1, 2 lenses out of 15 eyes injected with AdDL exhibited subcapsular plaques in the absence of any lens rupture. However, these eyes also showed a moderate amount of inflammation, suggesting that the cataracts may have developed in response to excessive injury in the anterior segment of the eye. The remaining 13 eyes, showed a normal, lens epithelial monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). Injection with either AdTGF&#x003b2;1 or AdDL also produced a mild inflammatory response as evidenced by presence of a small number of neutrophils and macrophages both in the aqueous humor and within the corneal stroma. These effects were transient and absent by day 21. AdTGF&#x003b2;1 treated eyes, however, demonstrated persistent thickening and increased cellularity of the corneal stroma, as well as a reduction in the number of corneal epithelial layers. Adhesions between the corneal endothelium and iris were also common. These non-lens features have also been reported in the TGF&#x003b2;1-transgenic mouse models, whereby active TGF&#x003b2;1 is overexpressed in lens fiber cells during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>].

We tested this by delivering AdTGF&#x003b2;1 to the anterior chamber of Smad3KO eyes. Four days post injection of AdTGF&#x003b2;1, the lenses of Smad3KO and WT mice showed distinct subcapsular plaques consisting of a focal multi-layering of cells in the central, anterior region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8A,B</xref>, respectively) that were positive for &#x003b1;SMA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8C,D</xref>, respectively). However, Smad3KO mice exhibited plaques that were reduced in size relative to those seen in WT littermates. To further investigate why the plaques in the Smad3KO mice were smaller than WT littermates we performed experiments to assess both cellular proliferation and apoptosis. To detect cellular proliferation, we immunostained sections with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). These experiments showed no observable difference in the amount of cells immunoreactive to PCNA in the lens plaques of AdTGF&#x003b2;1-treated Smad3KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8E</xref>) versus plaques in the AdTGF&#x003b2;1-treated WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8F</xref>).

Adenoviral delivery of TGF&#x003b2;1 to the anterior chamber of the mouse eye produced the formation of distinct subcapsular cataracts, 4 days post injection, which exhibited features of ASC plaques described in humans and other rodent models, including an induction in &#x003b1;SMA expression and aberrant deposition of ECM. Unlike TGF&#x003b2;1-transgenic mouse models, whereby active TGF&#x003b2;1 is overexpressed in lens fiber cells during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>], the AdTGF&#x003b2;1 gene delivery model does not require the postnatal period (21 days after birth) that the transgenic models require for subcapsular plaques to be observed. Also, since heterozygote lines of the transgenic mice are typically used for examination, due to the severity of the homozygous phenotype, each mouse or embryo of the TGF&#x003b2;1-transgenic line to be examined must be genotyped. The AdTGF&#x003b2;1 model does not require crossbreeding or genotyping and can therefore be more easily employed in studies utilizing genetically modified mice.</p><p>Intravitreal injection of recombinant TGF&#x003b2; into the rat eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>] has been shown to produce ASC following 15 weeks post injection, however the ASC were not well defined and were accompanied by a number of other lens defects, including cortical clouding, disrupted bow region, nucleated fiber cells, vacuolation of fiber cells, and posterior subcapsular cataracts containing swollen and degenerating cells. These features are not typically found in patients with ASC and none of these features were observed in our AdTGF&#x003b2; model, even at 3 weeks post injection. Injection into the vitreous cavity as opposed to the anterior chamber may have different outcomes. For example, Oksala et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>] found that intracameral injection of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) increased, whereas intravitreal injection of CGRP decreased intraocular pressure. Thus, the difference in response to TGF&#x003b2; in the two models may be related to the site of delivery. Intracameral delivery of recombinant TGF&#x003b2; in rodents has not been described, and this may be due to the fact that it is quickly turned over in the anterior chamber through drainage of the aqueous humor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>].</p><p>Another in vivo model of ASC is a lens injury model in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. In this model, a hypodermic needle is inserted trans-corneally to disrupt the lens capsule, resulting in the EMT of LECs and ASC formation. While this model produces many of the features observed in human ASC, one aspect of this model is rupture of the lens capsule, which is not associated with ASC development. Disruption of the capsule in the lens injury model results in exposure of the lens crystallins to resident antigen presenting cells and may elicit an immune response that may not normally be found in ASC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. Similarly, the recent ASC model developed using topical alkali application to the ocular surface elicits wound responses in multiple tissues of the anterior segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Use of adenoviral vectors in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>] typically induces both innate and adaptive immune responses to the viral proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. Anterior chamber injections, however, typically do not produce systemic responses and do not induce delayed type hypersensitivity when animals are re-challenged with antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Thus, in the AdTGF&#x003b2;1 model, the lens capsule remains intact and only a minimal immune response directed against the adenoviral vector is observed. Additionally, since transgene expression is transient, a small initial dose may be all that is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>].</p><p>While many laboratories have shown that adenovirus can transduce lens epithelial cells in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>], the ability of the adenovirus to transduce the lens epithelium in vivo has been a matter of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. However, using both AdGFP and AdLacZ vectors we demonstrated that adenoviral delivery to the anterior chamber resulted in transduction of the mouse lens epithelium, in the absence of a capsular break. Additionally, AdTGF&#x003b2;1 treated eyes showed upregulated levels of TGF&#x003b2;1 in the lens epithelium. Recent work has shown that intravitreal injection of AAV vectors encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein can also transduce the lens epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. In addition to the lens, we found that multiple structures of the anterior chamber, including the corneal endothelium and stromal cells, were also transduced by AdLacZ. Thus, delivery of the AdTGF&#x003b2;1 may have resulted in the transduction of many of these tissues which as a result may have contributed to development of the AdTGF&#x003b2;1-induced ASC. At the present time it is not known whether transduction of the lens is required for development of ASC. Nonetheless, the intracameral delivery of AdTGF&#x003b2;1 represents a quick and reproducible model for ASC in mice.</p><p>Employment of the AdTGF&#x003b2;1 model to the Smad3 deficient mice confirmed our earlier findings demonstrating that while Smad3 is sufficient for, it is not necessary for the EMT of LECs during ASC formation in vivo. In our recent study, TGF&#x003b2;1 transgenic mice expressing active TGF&#x003b2;1 under the &#x003b1;A-crystallin promoter, were bred onto a Smad3KO background and exhibited ASC plaques, albeit they were smaller than those found in their wild-type littermates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. This was correlated with an increase in apoptosis in the subcapsular plaques and a decrease in expression of collagen type IV. Similar to these findings, we also observe that AdTGF&#x003b2;1 induced ASC were smaller in Smad3KO animals compared to their wildtype littermates and exhibited higher numbers of apoptotic cells. We further extended this finding to show that proliferation of cells in the ASC, as assessed by PCNA immunostaining, did not appear to differ between the AdTGF&#x003b2;1-treated Smad3KO and wild-type mice. Thus together these data suggest that decreased cell survival is likely to be the underlying cause of the smaller sized plaques in the Smad3KO mice.</p><p>Findings for the models described above, as well as the recently developed alkali burn model, are in contrast to earlier work by Saika and colleagues which showed that Smad3 deficient mice were resistant to ASC formation in response to lens injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. One possible explanation for the difference, as also pointed out by these authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>], is that the levels of active TGF&#x003b2; produced in each of the models may be different. The adenoviral gene transfer and transgenic approaches may have produced larger amounts of active TGF&#x003b2; than that of the lens injury model. Indeed different transgenic promoters with different strengths were shown to result in variability in the severity of anterior chamber and lens defects in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Finally, individual susceptibility among mouse strains has been well documented and may explain some of these differences. For example, strains that are susceptible to fibrosis-inducing stimuli include C57BL/6, which were used in these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we have developed a novel model of ASC involving adenoviral delivery of active porcine TGF&#x003b2;1 to the anterior segment of rodent eye. AdTGF&#x003b2;1 induced ASC consisting of epithelial multilayering beneath the lens capsule and induction of &#x003b1;SMA expression within 4 days, which was sufficient to further induce aberrant deposition of ECM in mice out to 21 days post infection. We also confirm that TGF&#x003b2;1-induced EMT of LECs as evidenced by &#x003b1;SMA expression is not Smad3-dependent in that Smad3 deficient mice can develop small ASC plaques that are &#x003b1;SMA positive, further demonstrating that additional TGF&#x003b2; signaling cascades participate in the EMT of LECs and ASC formation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work
