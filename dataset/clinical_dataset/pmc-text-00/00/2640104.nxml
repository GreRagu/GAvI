Most of these pamphlets reprint articles published in contemporaneous medical periodicals, though one pamphlet was not published elsewhere. There is internal evidence that Hughlings Jackson circulated these pamphlets privately. Some contain marginal comments and corrections in Hughlings Jackson's hand, and in other hands as well.</p><p>The Rockefeller Medical Library collection contains five boxes of loose items, which are labelled boxes A&#x02013;E. Each item is assigned a serial number in the order in which it appears in the collection. The identification number consists of the box letter followed by the serial number.</p><p>A3.
