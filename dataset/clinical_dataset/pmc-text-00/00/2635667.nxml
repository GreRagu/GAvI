In this study, we evaluated the ability of whole berries and berry phytochemical, ellagic acid to reduce endogenous oxidative DNA damage. Ellagic acid was selected based on &#x0003e;95% inhibition of 8-oxodeoxyguosine (8-oxodG) and other unidentified oxidative DNA adducts induced by 4-hydroxy-17&#x000df;-estradiol and CuCl<sub>2</sub> in vitro. Inhibition of the latter occurred at lower concentrations (10 &#x003bc;M) than that for 8-oxodG (100 &#x003bc;M). In the in vivo study, female CD-1 mice (n=6) were fed either a control diet or diet supplemented with ellagic acid (400 ppm) and dehydrated berries (5% w/w) with varying ellagic acid contents &#x02013; blueberry (low), strawberry (medium) and red raspberry (high), for 3 weeks. Blueberry and strawberry diets showed moderate reductions in endogenous DNA adducts (25%). However, both red raspberry and ellagic acid diets showed a significant reduction of 59% (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and 48% (p &#x0003c; 0.01), respectively. Both diets also resulted in a 3&#x02013;8 fold over-expression of genes involved in DNA repair such as xeroderma pigmentosum group A complementing protein (XPA), DNA excision repair protein (ERCC5) and DNA ligase III (DNL3).

Introduction</title><p>Estrogens are involved in the development of several cancers, especially those of the female reproductive system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-3-327">1</xref>]. Breast, uterine and ovarian cancers cause a combined mortality of over 62,000 women in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-3-327">1</xref>]. Apart from its growth stimulatory effects, estrogen is also implicated in other etiological aspects of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-3-327">2</xref>]. It has been shown that 17&#x000df;-estardiol (E<sub>2</sub>) and its metabolites can lead to mutations by increasing the rate of DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-9-3-327">3</xref>] as well as decreasing DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-9-3-327">4</xref>]. Metabolites of E<sub>2</sub> such as 2- and 4-hydroxy estradiol (4E<sub>2</sub>), can cause oxidative DNA damage in the presence of Cu<sup>2+</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-9-3-327">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-9-3-327">6</xref>]. Further, these metabolites have been detected <italic>in vivo</italic> during mammary tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-9-3-327">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijms-9-3-327">8</xref>]. Thus, they may be linked with the development of estrogen-mediated carcinogenesis. Since DNA damage is a key step in the initiation of cancer, effective inhibition of this damage may be a useful prevention strategy.</p><p>There are several methods available to assess DNA damage. Among these, ones that combine a chromatographic method with mass spectrometry have been used to measure numerous products simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-9-3-327">9</xref>]. Also, <sup>32</sup>P-postlabeling in conjunction with polyethyleneimine (PEI)-cellulose thin-layer chromatography (TLC), can be used to measure oxidative DNA damage of various DNA bases, including the benchmark oxidative lesion 8-oxo-2&#x02032;-deoxyguonosine (8-oxodG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-3-327">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-3-327">12</xref>]. Recently, we have discovered several novel polar DNA adducts by <sup>32</sup>P-postlabeling and low-salt PEI-cellulose TLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-3-327">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-3-327">13</xref>]. Although these adducts are as yet unidentified, chromatographic comparison with oxidative DNA adducts formed by Fenton-type reaction (Cu<sup>2+</sup>-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) suggest that some of the polar tissue adducts may be oxidative adducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-3-327">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-3-327">13</xref>]. These adducts can be used as a biomarker for selection of antioxidants. Earlier studies from this laboratory have successfully used detection of DNA damage in conjunction with a cell-free system to rapidly screen for chemopreventive/antioxidant agents, thus expediting the process of agent selection. We have been successful in using a tiered approach in reducing benzo[<italic>a</italic>]pyrene-induced DNA damage. Agents such as oltipraz and ellagic acid that were effective in an enzymatic cell-free system were effective in both cell-culture and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-3-327">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-9-3-327">16</xref>].</p><p>There are several surrogate biomarkers available to assess the efficacy of dietary agents in a biological system. Among these, the liver due to its proximity and role in the first-pass mechanism represents a suitable surrogate tissue. In addition, due to its high metabolic activity, liver is constantly exposed to the oxidative by-products of cell metabolism, thus making it a suitable tissue to assess the modulation of baseline endogenous oxidative DNA damage by dietary agents.</p><p>We undertook an exploratory study to assess the efficacy of dietary berries, a rich source of ellagic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-9-3-327">17</xref>] and pure ellagic acid to reduce endogenous DNA damage in a surrogate tissue (liver) of CD-1 mice to determine if these agents could be used as potential chemopreventive agents against estrogen-mediated carcinogenesis. Female CD-1 mice are highly susceptible to catechol estrogen-induced uterine carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-3-327">18</xref>]. Initially, several agents were tested in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system involving induction of oxidative DNA damage by redox cycling of 4E<sub>2</sub> catalyzed by CuCl<sub>2</sub>. The most efficacious agent ellagic acid (&#x0003e;95% inhibition of oxidative DNA damage) and its natural source (berries) were then employed in a short-term, <italic>in vivo</italic>, dietary intervention study. The modulation of DNA damage both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> was assessed by <sup>32</sup>P-postlabeling/TLC. In addition, the possible mechanisms by which these agents modulate DNA damage <italic>in vivo</italic> were explored by gene-expression analyses using microarray technology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>2.

These adducts were chromatographically similar to adducts generated by treatment of DNA with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/CuCl<sub>2</sub> (unpublished data). Neither 4E<sub>2</sub> nor Cu<sup>2+</sup> by themselves showed a significant increase in the baseline adduct levels (data not shown).

In the initial screening, ellagic acid was found to be the most effective, showing &#x0003e;95% reduction of both unidentified oxidative adducts and 8-oxodG compared to the vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-3-327">Figure 1</xref>A3, B3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-327">Figure 2</xref>, p&#x0003c;0.05). This agent also showed a dose-dependant modulation of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-327">Figure 2</xref>). The unidentified polar adduct levels were diminished by 25% at an ellagic acid concentration of only 10 &#x003bc;M, but significant reductions in 8-oxodG levels were observed only at 100 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-327">Figure 2</xref> inset). Based on these results, ellagic acid was selected for a short-term <italic>in vivo</italic> study.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 Modulation of baseline endogenous oxidative-DNA damage by ellagic acid and berries</title><p>There was no significant effect of supplementation with berries or ellagic acid on the diet intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-3-327">Figure 3A</xref>) or weight gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-3-327">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating both the absence of toxicity at the doses tested and variation in caloric density of the different diets. All groups represented qualitatively similar adduct pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-3-327">Figure 4</xref>). The baseline levels of different subgroups of adducts in the liver of mice fed control diet varied &#x0003e; 20 fold: P-1, 4810 &#x000b1; 596; P-2, 3398 &#x000b1; 316; PL-1, 197 &#x000b1; 32 and L-1, 3074 &#x000b1; 697 per 10<sup>9</sup> nucleotides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-3-327">Table 1</xref>). PL-2 adducts were too low to be quantified and 8-oxodG and L-2 adducts were not analyzed. Red raspberry diet significantly reduced all subgroups of adducts analyzed with a 63% reduction of P-1 adducts (p&#x0003c;0.05), 68% reduction of P-2 adducts (p &#x0003c; 0.001), 57% reduction of PL-1 adducts and a 42% reduction of L-1 adducts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-3-327">Table 1</xref>). Ellagic acid showed similar effects albeit at a lower level with 57% reduction in P-1 adducts (p&#x0003c;0.05), 64% reduction in P-2 adducts (p &#x0003c; 0.01), 49% reduction in PL-1 adducts and 17% reduction in L-1 adducts. Blueberry and strawberry diets had moderate but statistically insignificant effects on all adduct subgroups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-3-327">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Four different subgroups of unidentified polar DNA adducts were quantified.

Microarray analysis revealed that several genes were modulated in a similar fashion by both diets. In particular, genes involved with DNA repair such as &#x02013; xeroderma pigmentosum group A complementing protein (XPA), DNA ligase III (DNL3), DNA excision repair protein (ERCC5)- were found to be over-expressed by 3 to 8 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-3-327">Figure 5</xref> , p&#x0003c;0.05). There was a significant similarity in the number of genes over- or under-expressed by both diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-3-327">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, red raspberry diet down-regulated genes such as Mitogen activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14) and MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), involved in key cell-signaling pathways, by 5&#x02013;15 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-3-327">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion|conclusions"><title>3. Discussion and Conclusions</title><p>The purpose of this study was to explore selection of chemopreventive agents against estrogen-mediated carcinogenesis using a semi-tiered approach. First, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> system involving induction of DNA damage by a carcinogenic estrogen- metabolite (4E<sub>2</sub>) to rapidly screen for a highly effective antioxidant. Then we implemented the results from this tier in a short-term <italic>in vivo</italic> study. The analysis of oxidative DNA damage in both systems provided the mechanistic link to test the biological effects of test agents. CD-1 mice, which are highly susceptible to estrogen-induced carcinogenesis, were used so that the results may be applied to other estrogen-induced malignancies as well. Also, we used a surrogate tissue (liver) instead of a target tissue in order to get an initial assessment of the biological effects of ellagic acid, a compound known to have limited bioavailability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-9-3-327">20</xref>].</p><p>The induction of oxidative DNA damage by 4E<sub>2</sub> in the presence of Cu<sup>2+</sup> is postulated to involve hydroxyl radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijms-9-3-327">21</xref>]. The pattern of polar oxidative adducts generated <italic>in vitro</italic> using either 4E<sub>2</sub>/CuCl<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/CuCl<sub>2</sub> was similar as determined by co-chromatography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-9-3-327">11</xref>], indicatng that adducts in 4E<sub>2</sub> and CuCl<sub>2</sub> reaction originated from oxidative mechanisms. Several studies indicate that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Cu<sup>2+</sup> as well as Cu<sup>+</sup>/Cu<sup>2+</sup> redox cycling is involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 4E<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijms-9-3-327">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijms-9-3-327">23</xref>]. The <italic>in vitro</italic> results from this study correlates well with previous studies from this laboratory in which ellagic acid significantly reduced 8-oxodG induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/CuCl<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijms-9-3-327">19</xref>]. The trend in induction of both unidentified oxidative adducts and 8-oxodG were similar, but the relative levels of 8-oxodG was higher in 4E<sub>2</sub>/CuCl<sub>2</sub> reaction. Copper ions are known to be associated with purine bases in the DNA, thus imparting site specificity for oxidation of guanine bases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijms-9-3-327">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijms-9-3-327">24</xref>]. Earlier studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that catechols of polychlorinated biphenyls can lead to singlet oxygen-mediated 8-oxodG generation in the presence of Cu<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijms-9-3-327">24</xref>]. DNA bases other than guanine are equally predisposed to oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijms-9-3-327">25</xref>] and the unidentified polar adducts may be the result of such damage. Using the current technique we were able to quantify total oxidative DNA damage along with selective measurement of benchmark lesion, 8-oxodG.</p><p>Ellagic acid, a polyphenol present in berries, is very effective in reduction of 8-oxodG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijms-9-3-327">19</xref>]. In this study, it showed a dose-dependant modulation of many oxidative DNA adducts and reduced the levels of unidentified adducts even at 10 &#x003bc;M, whereas a much higher concentration of ellagic acid (100 &#x003bc;M) was required to inhibit 8-oxodG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-3-327">Figure 2</xref>-Inset), suggesting that these 2 types of oxidative lesions develop via separate mechanisms. Singlet oxygen is known to play a predominant role in the generation of 8-oxodG, whereas the hydroxyl radical causes a more promiscuous damage to all DNA bases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijms-9-3-327">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijms-9-3-327">22</xref>]. Thus, ellagic acid may be more effective in protecting against hydroxyl radical-induced DNA damage at lower concentrations. It is also reported that ellagic acid covalently binds with DNA, but with a higher affinity to poly (dA X dT) than poly (dG X dC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijms-9-3-327">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ijms-9-3-327">27</xref>]. Such selective interactions with the DNA bases may also explain its differential effects at lower doses. Furthermore, it has already been reported that similar mechanisms are involved in the prevention of carcinogen-DNA adducts by ellagic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijms-9-3-327">28</xref>], in addition to alteration of carcinogen metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijms-9-3-327">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijms-9-3-327">30</xref>].</p><p>Liver is the primary organ involved in the first-pass mechanism and is affected by both harmful and protective components of the diet. It is also a highly metabolic organ that may possess high levels of endogenous oxidative DNA damage resulting from normal metabolism. Therefore, the ability of any dietary component to reduce the levels of endogenous oxidative DNA damage at baseline would make it an ideal preventive agent in the presence of additional oxidative stress. In this study, we analyzed the levels of at least 4 subgroups (P1, P2, PL-1 and L-1) of novel, unidentified polar DNA adducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-3-327">Figure 3</xref>). Although these adduct subgroups have not been identified, studies from this laboratory show that all of these adduct subgroups increase during the inflammation of the cervix, suggesting that oxidative stress may play a role in the generation of these adducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-3-327">12</xref>]. Also, in a separate study, both P-1 and 8-oxodG were induced in the liver of female ACI rats (n=4) after a 12-week treatment with 17&#x000df;-estradiol implants (22,000 &#x000b1; 7600 and 14,000 &#x000b1; 4400, respectively; p&#x0003c;0.001) compared with sham-treatment (10,000 &#x000b1; 1200 and 5000 &#x000b1; 2500, respectively) (H. Aiyer and R. Gupta, unpublished data). Similar trends in the induction of both P-1 and 8-oxodG after E<sub>2</sub> treatment <italic>in vivo</italic> suggest that they may also originate from oxidative stress. Further, this increase was significantly inhibited by dietary ellagic acid (7800 &#x000b1; 3300 and 3000 &#x000b1; 2000, respectively; p&#x0003c;0.001) (unpublished data), suggesting that dietary ellagic acid is highly effective in reducing hepatic DNA damage caused by E<sub>2</sub> treatment.</p><p>To determine if berries and ellagic acid would protect against oxidative stress, we tested their efficacy in reducing endogenous DNA damage in the liver of CD1 mice fed diet containing 5% (w/w) of different berries, or 400 ppm ellagic acid. The berries investigated have different ellagic content &#x02013; raspberries (1500 ppm ellagic acid), strawberries (500 ppm ellagic acid) and blueberries (&#x0003c;100 ppm ellagic acid)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-9-3-327">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijms-9-3-327">31</xref>]. The dose of ellagic acid was selected based on earlier work by Stoner and colleagues who showed that 400 ppm of dietary ellagic acid, when fed to rats for 23 days, showed significant reduction in hepatic P450 content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijms-9-3-327">32</xref>]. Further, the same dose was also effective in reducing N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA)-induced esophageal tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijms-9-3-327">33</xref>]. In this study, both red raspberry and ellagic acid elicited similar effects in reducing the baseline oxidative DNA damage. Since raspberry has the highest ellagic acid content among the berries tested and showed similar effects as pure ellagic acid, we explored the possibility of a shared mechanism in reducing DNA damage. Gene-expression analyses suggested that this effect may partly be due to up-regulation of DNA repair genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-3-327">Figure 5</xref>). Also, both red raspberry and ellagic acid modulate several genes in a similar fashion, suggesting that the ellagic acid content of raspberries may play a role in their effectiveness. It should however be noted that the concentration of ellagic acid available in the diet through raspberry is 5-fold lower than diet supplemented with pure ellagic acid (75 ppm versus 400 ppm), which shows that ellagic acid present as ellagitannins in berries, may be more bioavailable from berries. This is further confirmed by the moderate effects of both blueberry and strawberry diets on total DNA damage. Indeed 5% strawberries were more effective than 400 ppm ellagic acid in reducing NMBA-induced esophageal tumors suggesting improved bioavailability from a natural source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijms-9-3-327">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ijms-9-3-327">34</xref>] and blueberries, which contain the least ellagic acid were ineffective against the same [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijms-9-3-327">35</xref>]. Alternatively berries also contain varying levels of anthocyanins that are known antioxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijms-9-3-327">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijms-9-3-327">36</xref>], which may also account for their effectiveness. Ellagic acid is protective against hepatic metal-toxicity and carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis, where oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ijms-9-3-327">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ijms-9-3-327">39</xref>]. It is clear from our results that ellagic acid and raspberry are hepato-protective via similar mechanisms and are highly effective in reducing baseline endogenous oxidative DNA damage. These effects may, in part, be due to up-regulation of DNA repair genes. Although numerous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have examined the effects of different polyphenols on DNA damage and repair, conclusive <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence is still lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ijms-9-3-327">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ijms-9-3-327">42</xref>]. Our current study supports the role of berry polyphenols in sustaining genomic stability <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that ellagic acid is highly effective in preventing oxidative DNA damage both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The prevention of oxidative damage induced by 4E<sub>2</sub>, a potentially carcinogenic metabolite in estrogen-mediated cancers, suggests that ellagic acid may be effective in hormonal carcinogenesis. The differential modulation of unidentified oxidative adducts versus 8-oxodG <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggests that ellagic acid is more effective in the inhibition of hydroxyl radical-induced DNA damage than singlet oxygen-induced damage. Dietary ellagic acid is highly effective in reducing baseline hepatocellular oxidative DNA damage partly via enhanced DNA repair. Red raspberry, a natural source of ellagic acid, is more efficacious than pure ellagic acid and also causes upregulation of DNA repair enzymes, making it a suitable candidate for nutritional intervention. Both berries and ellagic acid significantly reduce hepatic oxidative DNA damage, suggesting their usefulness in other hepatic pathologies in which oxidative mechanisms are implicated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>4.
