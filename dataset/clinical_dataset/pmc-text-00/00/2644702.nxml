The mortality rate is higher than bacteremias caused by other gram-negative opportunistic pathogens. One of the most important features of the bacterium is its resistance to various antibacterial agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and even newly developed antibiotics have failed to reduce the mortality rate associated with this organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>There is increasing interest in bacterial virulence factors as a basis for effective vaccines and immunotherapies. Several extracellular products from <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>such as exotoxin A, exoenzyme S, phospholipase and hemolysins have been studies as potential virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The role of exotoxin A in the mortality of experimentally-infected animals has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and the LD50 of the exotoxin reported to be 60&#x02013;80 ng/mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Following a single injection of 80 ng of exotoxin A, necrosis, and cellular swelling were detected in liver within 48 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Hemorrhage in the lungs and necrosis in the kidneys were also reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In eukaryotic cells, when exotoxin A turns into an activated enzyme, transfer of an adenosine diphosphate ribose moiety from NAD led to inactivation of elongation factor 2 and inhibition of protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the pre-existence of a high titer of anti-exotoxin A antibody reportedly increased the survival rate in patients with <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>bacteremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>This study was performed to determine the immunogenicity of a toxoid produced from exotoxin A of <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>in a mouse burn model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of exotoxin A</title><p>A toxigenic strain of <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>(PA 103) was used for exotoxin A preparation. Exotoxin A was partially purified according to the method described by Pollack et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and Homma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>was inoculated into tryptic soy agar and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 h in ambient conditions. The growth product of the slant cultures was inoculated into 500 mL of Muller-Hinton broth and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for another 24 h in ambient conditions. The bacterial suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 2000 g and the supernatant containing exotoxin A was sterilized by the Millipore filtration method (0.45 &#x003bc;m) and concentrated 10&#x000d7; by polyethylene glycol (PEG) in a dialysis bag (30 mm diameter, Biogen, Mashhad, Iran). 200 mL of the concentrated supernatant was mixed with 200 mL of diethyl amino ethyl cellulose and stirred at 4&#x000b0;C. Exotoxin A was precipitated by the addition of 0.25 M of NaCl and 70% saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in 0.1 M of Tris hydrochloride buffer containing 0.5 M of NaCl and 0.02% of NaN3 (pH 8 at 4&#x000b0;C) and then applied into a column packed with Sephadex G75. The various fractions were collected and concentrated in dialysis bags (10 mm diameter, Biogen, Mashhad, Iran). Concentrated semi-purified exotoxin A was examined for presence of exotoxin A using the counter immunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) method. The protein content of exotoxin A was adjusted to 50 &#x003bc;g/mL by a spectrophotometer and used to immunize the mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Animal selection</title><p>75 white out-bred mice were provided from the Laboratory Animal Research Center of the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, housed in an ambient temperature of 21 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C and relative humidity of 65&#x02013;70%, and given a balanced diet with free access to food and water. Animal selection, all experiments, subsequent care and the sacrifice procedure were all performed according to the guidelines and under the supervision of the Animal Care Committee of the Iran Veterinary Organization. The protocol for anesthesia, burn induction, post-burn care and sacrifice were identical for all animals. The animals were sacrificed under deep ether general anesthesia. All experiments were carried out under aseptic conditions. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of LD50</title><p>To determine the LD50 of the exotoxin, 50 additional mice were divided into 10 equal groups. A series of dilutions, up to ten-fold, of 50 &#x003bc;g/mL of semi-purified exotoxin A were prepared in PBS (pH 7.2). Each of the 10 groups was assigned to one of the 10 dilutions, and 1 mL of solution was injected intraperitoneally in each animal. Therefore, the mice received between 0.0005 and 5 &#x003bc;g of exotoxin A. The mice were followed for 30 days. The LD50 was determined according to the Reed and Muench method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and calculated to be 0.5 &#x003bc;g.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of toxoid</title><p>To prepare the toxoid, 5 mL of semi-purified exotoxin A was mixed with 10 mL of PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.01 M sodium phosphate, 0.15 M sodium chloride and 4% formaldehyde, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 days before being dialyzed against phosphate buffer for 48 h. The attenuated toxin was sterilized by Millipore filtration (0.45 &#x003bc;m).</p></sec><sec><title>Mice immunization with toxoid</title><p>50 mice were assigned to the experimental group. 2 mice died before the burns were administered and were not enrolled in the study. The remaining 48 mice were immunized with the toxoid. Each mouse received weekly subcutaneous injections for 6 weeks. Each injection contained 100 &#x003bc;g of semi-purified toxoid in 2 mL of PBS. 1 week after the last injection, the animals were bled from the eye and the samples checked for the presence of antitoxin using CIEP. To determine more precisely the ranges of immunity in the vaccinated mice, the titer of anti-exotoxin A was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Rabbits hyperimmunization with toxoid</title><p>A group of 4 rabbits were immunized with the toxoid. Each rabbit received weekly subcutaneous injections for 6 weeks. Each injection contained 200 &#x003bc;g of semi-purified toxoid in 4 mL of PBS. 1 week after the last injection, the animals were bled from the ear. Sera were pooled and the presence of antitoxin against <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>confirmed by CIEP. The sera were used as an antitoxin when necessary, to evaluate the presence of the toxin in the sera of the experimental and control mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Counterimmunoelectrophoresis</title><p>CIEP was carried out for qualitative detection of toxin and antitoxin in the sera of the immunized mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This technique was applied on 13 &#x000d7; 18 cm glass slides which were covered by 1% melted agarose in acetate buffer (pH 7.6). 2 rows of wells with a diameter of 6 &#x000d7; 6 mm were punched in each glass slide and 0.4 mL of semi-purified exotoxin A or serum containing the exotoxin A (antigen) and 0.4 mL of immunized mice or rabbit serum (antibody) were placed in the anodal and cathodal wells, respectively. The slide was subjected to electrophoresis using an acetate buffer (pH 7.6 at 40 mA for 30 min). Production of a precipitation line between the two wells indicated the presence of antitoxin or toxin A in the sera. The Amidoblack staining method was used to reveal the precipitation lines more clearly.</p></sec><sec><title>Determining the efficacy of the candidate vaccine</title><p>73 mice (48 immunized = experimental group, 25 non-immunized = control group) were anesthetized and burns (grade 3) were induced on the thigh using a 1 &#x000d7; 2 cm piece of hot metal, producing a burn of up to 10% of the total body surface and extending to all layers of skin but not involving the muscular tissue.

As expected, no exotoxin A was detected in the sera by CIEP, which may be due to neutralization of the toxin by previously antitoxins formed following immunization. Bacterial infection is a major complication after thermal injury, especially in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. 75% of deaths following burns are related to microbial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>is a frequently isolated bacterium that causes septicemia and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It is a ubiquitous opportunistic, non-fermenting, gram-negative rod that can infect patients with impaired immune systems. Treatment of <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>infection is frequently hindered by antibiotic resistance, and multi-drug resistant strains are mostly isolated from burn wound infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. An efficient vaccine is therefore needed. After colonizing the site of the burn, <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>produces several virulence factors, such as exotoxin A, alkaline protease and elastase, which affect the host tissue. High titers of antitoxin against exotoxin A in patients infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>reduces the risk septicemia and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Survival rates, presence of exotoxin A, culture results and colony counts in the experimental group (immunized mice) inoculated with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center">Post-inoculation <break/>time (day)<break/></th><th align="center">Number of  <break/>animals alive<break/>(survival rate, %)</th><th align="center">CFU/mL from  <break/>inoculated<break/>burns</th><th align="center">Exotoxin A  <break/>in sera<break/>(%)*</th><th align="center">Positive  <break/>culture<break/>(%)</th><th align="center" colspan="3">Number of  <break/>animals alive<break/>(survival rate, %)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td align="center">Liver</td><td align="center">Spleen</td><td align="center">Blood</td></tr><tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">48 (100)</td><td align="center">1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup></td><td align="center">ND</td><td align="center">48 (100)</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">48 (100)</td><td align="center">1.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup></td><td align="center">ND</td><td align="center">48 (100)</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td></tr><tr><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">47 (98)</td><td align="center">1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup></td><td align="center">ND</td><td align="center">47 (100)</td><td align="center">1 (2)</td><td align="center">1 (2)</td><td align="center">1 (2)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">11</td><td align="center">46 (96)</td><td align="center">1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup></td><td align="center">ND</td><td align="center">47 (98)</td><td align="center">1 (2)</td><td align="center">1 (2)</td><td align="center">1 (2)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">14</td><td align="center">45 (94)</td><td align="center">1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup></td><td align="center">ND</td><td align="center">45 (94)</td><td align="center">1 (2)</td><td align="center">1 (2)</td><td align="center">1 (2)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>ND, not detectable by CIEP; * neutralizing antibody detected</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Exotoxin A is the principal lethal factor of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. It seems logical that a toxoid of exotoxin A could be used as an effective vaccine. Our study shows that in mice immunized with semi-purified exotoxin A, a protective titer of antitoxin developed that effectively prevented the experimentally infected animals from septicemia and death. The majority (93.8%) of immunized infected mice survived during 70 days of observation after a burn wound was inoculated with <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>while all the non-immunized mice in the control group died. The rising antibody titer in the surviving mice and the decrease in the mortality rate indicate the presence of an effective antitoxin in the immunized mice.</p><p>Pavlovskis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] found that the survival rate did not increase significantly following active immunization with a toxoid of exotoxin A and infection with <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>in burned mice. However, Matsumato et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] found that immunization with a combination of alkaline protease and toxoid of exotoxin A decreased mortality. Some investigators have reported that active immunization with a lipopolysaccharide and an outer membrane protein (OMP) of <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>could control the infection in the burned area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our study, using a semi-purified exotoxin A that contained trace amounts of LPS and OMP, points to a higher efficacy than a toxoid prepared from purified exotoxin A. Our study did not include different strains of the bacterium but our results can be used for further studies on the purification of, and determination of cross-immunization of, different strains of the bacterium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Three of the immunized mice (6.3%) died. This may be due to the presence of invasive factors other than exotoxin A, such as elastase, alkaline protease, hemolysins, leukocidin, siderophores, siderophore uptake systems and pyocyanin diffusible pigment. Passive immunization was not evaluated in this study: We chose to study active immunization because this could play a role in high-risk occupations such as fire fighting and baking. Our results demonstrate that in a mouse model of bacterial infection in burn wounds, active immunization with semipurified exotoxin A protected against infection with <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>and reduced mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AM plastic surgeon, main researcher, cooperated in inducing burns.
