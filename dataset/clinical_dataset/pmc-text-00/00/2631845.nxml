During the rainy seasons of 1998 and 1999, 23 (eight deaths) and 34 (eight deaths) human cases of YF were reported, respectively, in different geographic areas of Par&#x000e1; State; most cases were on Maraj&#x000f3; Island. Patients were 1 to 46 years of age. Epidemiologic and ecological studies were conducted in Afu&#x000e1; and Breves on Maraj&#x000f3; Island; captured insects yielded isolates of 4 and 11 YF strains, respectively, from Haemagogus janthinomys pooled mosquitoes. The cases on Maraj&#x000f3; Island in 1999 resulted from lack of vaccination near the focus of the disease and intense migration, which brought many nonimmune people to areas where infected vectors were present. We hypothesize that YF virus remains in an area after an outbreak by vertical transmission among Haemagogus mosquitoes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
