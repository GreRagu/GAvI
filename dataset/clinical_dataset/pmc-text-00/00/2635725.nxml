Introduction</title><p>Litchi (<italic>Litchi chinensis Sonn</italic>.) is a subtropical fruit that originated in South-East Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-7-1333">1</xref>]. In recent years, litchi production has increased steadily around the world. Litchi fruit pericarp (LFP) accounts for approximately 15% by weight of the whole fresh fruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-7-1333">2</xref>] and contains significant amounts of phenolics, among which anthocyanins are the major polyphenols. Anthocyanins play an important pharmacological role against various human diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, inflammation and allergies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-9-7-1333">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-9-7-1333">6</xref>]. Furthermore, some studies have indicated that LFP is a powerful free radical scavenger and exhibits strong antioxidant activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-9-7-1333">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijms-9-7-1333">8</xref>], which suggest its use as a readily accessible source of natural antioxidants and/or a possible supplement in the food or pharmaceutical industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-7-1333">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-9-7-1333">6</xref>].</p><p>Extraction yields of phenolics from plant tissues depend on the various extraction conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-7-1333">2</xref>]. Most phenolics present in plant tissues are soluble in polar solvents and can be extracted using methanol containing small amount of hydrochloric or formic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-9-7-1333">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-9-7-1333">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-7-1333">10</xref>]. The low pH value of the extraction solution can prevent the oxidation of phenolics, while the use of low temperatures may preserve anthocyanin stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-7-1333">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-9-7-1333">11</xref>]. Thus, an investigation of the efficient extraction of phenolics from LFP requires evaluation under various temperatures and solvent pH values.</p><p>Anthocyanins are the major phenolics present in LFP. The major anthocyanins from LFP tissues were identified as epicatechin, proanthocyanidin B4 and proanthocyanidin B2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-7-1333">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-7-1333">10</xref>]. Anthocyanins show good antioxidant ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-9-7-1333">7</xref>], but they are relatively unstable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-9-7-1333">9</xref>]. As the stability of litchi anthocyanins is dependent on various factors, such as pH value and temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-7-1333">12</xref>], the antioxidant ability of the litchi anthocyanins under the conditions of various temperatures and pH values also needs further evaluation.</p><p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of various extraction temperatures and pH values on the extraction yield of phenolics from LFP and then evaluate total antioxidant ability and scavenging activities towards &#x003b1;,&#x003b1;-diphenyl-&#x003b2;-picrylhydrazy (DPPH) and hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion of the extracted litchi anthocyanins under various temperatures and pH conditions. The study will help improve extraction of phenolics from litchi fruit pericarp and promote better utilization of the extracted litchi anthocyanins as antioxidants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results|discussion"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><p>The extraction yield of phenolics from litchi fruit pericarp increased as the extraction temperature increased betwenn 30&#x02013;80 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-7-1333">Figure 1</xref>), which suggested that litchi phenolics are relatively stable under high temperature conditions. Significant differences existed among 30, 40, 50 and 60 &#x000b0;C but did not appear between 60 and 70 &#x000b0;C. Thus, in practice an extraction temperature of 60 &#x000b0;C could be used, basedon the combined effects of the good extraction yield of phenolics and the stability of litchi anthocyanins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-7-1333">12</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-7-1333">Figure 2</xref>, the extraction yield of phenolics from LFP increased as the pH values increased from 2 to 4, but it decreased as the pH values higher than 4 were used, which indicated that the extraction pH value significantly affected the extraction yield compared with other factors. The increased extraction yield from LFP under the low pH conditions could be due to the inhibition of the enzymatic oxidation of phenolics and/or the maintenance of the extracted anthyocyanin stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-7-1333">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-7-1333">12</xref>]. As the extraction efficiency and anthocyanin stability depend largely on the combined effects caused by temperature and pH of extraction solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-9-7-1333">11</xref>], further investigation to optimize the two extraction factors could be required.</p><p>Litchi anthocyanins from fruit pericarp tissues were readily purified by Amberlite XAD-7 chromatography column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-7-1333">10</xref>], which gave a good purification of anthocyanins from plant tissues and had no effect on the anthocyanin compositions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-7-1333">13</xref>]. In this study, the partially purified litchi anthocyanins were used to further examine the effect of various temperatures and pH values on the antioxidant activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-7-1333">Figure 3</xref>, the antioxidant activity of the litchi anthocyanins was enhanced with increasing temperature up to 45 &#x000b0;C, but it decreased as the incubation time was extended to 60 min. Furthermore, the antioxidant ability of litchi anthocyanins for 30 min at 45 &#x000b0;C was significantly higher than that 55 &#x000b0;C. This study suggested that an appropriate temperature maintained a high antioxidant activity of litchi anthocyanins, which could be due to the combined effect of non-enzymatic reaction and anthocyanin stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-7-1333">14</xref>].</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-7-1333">Figure 4</xref> shows the effects of various pH values on total antioxidant ability and scavenging activities of litchi anthocyanins against DPPH and hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion. The superoxide anion scavenging activity of litchi anthocyanins was relatively stable at pH 1&#x02013;5. However, there was a higher scavenging DPPH radical activity at pH 3&#x02013;5, which was significant compared with pH 1 or 7. In addition, the total antioxidant ability of litchi anthocyanins was enhanced as the incubation time was extended from 30 to 60 min. Thus, pH values in the reaction medium significantly influenced the total antioxidant ability and scavenging activities of litchi anthocyanins against DPPH radicals, hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion, which could be due to the anthocyanin stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-7-1333">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>3. Conclusions</title><p>Various temperatures and pH significantly influenced the extraction yield of phenolics from LFP and the antioxidant activity of the extracted litchi anthocyanins. Application of pH 4.0 exhibited the most efficient extraction while the extraction temperature of 60 &#x000b0;C could be used in terms of the combined effects of the extraction yield of phenolics and the stability of the extracted litchi anthocyanin. Furthermore, the temperatures from 45&#x02013;60 &#x000b0;C and pH values from 3 to 4 exhibited a relatively high antioxidant activity.

Experimental Section</title><sec><title>4.1. Plant materials</title><p>Fresh fruits of litchi (<italic>Litchi chinensis</italic> Sonn.) cv. Feizixiao were obtained from a commercial market in Guangzhou. Fruits were selected for uniformity and size and bruised or diseased fruits were then discarded. LFP tissues were collected, then dried and finally stored at &#x02212;18 &#x000b0;C for the following experiments.</p><sec><title>4.2. Experiment 1: Effects of various temperatures and pH values on extraction yield of phenolics from LFP</title><p>In our previous experiments, the use of 60% ethanol for an extraction time of 3 h exhibited the highest phenolic content from LFP. Thus, the extraction conditions were used to examine the effects of various temperatures and pH values on the extraction yield in this study. The dried LFP samples (5 g) were extracted for 3 h by stirring with 60% (v/v) ethanol (100 mL) at 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 or 80 &#x000b0;C and pH 7, or pH 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 adjusted by a diluted HCl solution and room temperature (25 &#x000b0;C). The homogenate was filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper under vacuum, collected, concentrated and then dried by a rotary evaporator under vacuum at 50 &#x000b0;C. The dried filtrate was re-dissolved in 60% (v/v) ethanol and then used for the analysis of total phenolic content. Total phenolic content was estimated with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent by the method of Singleton and Rossi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-9-7-1333">15</xref>], using gallic acid as a standard. Results were expressed as micrograms of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per gram on dry weight (DW) basis.</p></sec><sec><title>4.3. Experiment 2: Effects of temperatures and pH values on antioxidant activity of the extracted litchi anthocyanin</title><p>Litchi anthocyanin was extracted by the method of Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-7-1333">12</xref>]. The dried LFP tissues (50 g) were added to 1.5 M HCl solution in 95% ethanol (1 L) and then kept at 4 &#x000b0;C overnight. The extract solution was filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper and the filtrate was then collected as the crude litchi anthocyanin. The crude litchi anthocyanin was concentrated using a rotary evaporator under vacuum at 40 &#x000b0;C and purified by the method of Norbaek and Kondo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-9-7-1333">16</xref>]. The concentrated anthocyanin was loaded into Amberlite XAD-7 column (1.5 &#x000d7; 20 cm) and then eluted with acetonitrile-trifloroacetic acid-H<sub>2</sub>O (200 mL, 50:0.5:49.5, v/v/v) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-9-7-1333">17</xref>]. The largest anthocyanin fraction was collected and lyophilized. The lyophilized anthocyanin was dissolved in a small amount of methanol and then used to examine the effects of temperatures and pH values on the antioxidant activity. The anthocyanin content was determined using a Unic UV-2802 spectrophotometer at 535 nm. Litchi anthocyanin solution (1 mL) at 300 &#x003bc;g/mL was incubated at 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 &#x000b0;C and pH 4 for 30 or 60 min in water baths, whereas the anthocyanin solution (0.1 ml) was mixed with 0.9 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer solution at pH 1, 3, 5 or 7 and then incubated for 10 or 30 min at 25&#x000b0;C, prior to the measurements of total antioxidant ability and scavenging activities of DPPH radical, hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion.
