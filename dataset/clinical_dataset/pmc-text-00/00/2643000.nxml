This transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study explores the role of the left primary motor cortex in action-verb processing. TMS-induced motor-evoked potentials from right-hand muscles were recorded as a measure of M1 activity, while participants were asked either to judge explicitly whether a verb was action-related (semantic task) or to decide on the number of syllables in a verb (syllabic task). TMS was applied in three different experiments at 170, 350 and 500 ms post-stimulus during both tasks to identify when the enhancement of M1 activity occurred during word processing. The delays between stimulus onset and magnetic stimulation were consistent with electrophysiological studies, suggesting that word recognition can be differentiated into early (within 200 ms) and late (within 400 ms) lexical-semantic stages, and post-conceptual stages. Reaction times and accuracy were recorded to measure the extent to which the participants' linguistic performance was affected by the interference of TMS with M1 activity. No enhancement of M1 activity specific for action verbs was found at 170 and 350 ms post-stimulus, when lexical-semantic processes are presumed to occur (Experiments 1&#x02013;2). When TMS was applied at 500 ms post-stimulus (Experiment 3), processing action verbs, compared with non-action verbs, increased the M1-activity in the semantic task and decreased it in the syllabic task. This effect was specific for hand-action verbs and was not observed for action-verbs related to other body parts. Neither accuracy nor RTs were affected by TMS. These findings suggest that the lexical-semantic processing of action verbs does not automatically activate the M1. This area seems to be rather involved in post-conceptual processing that follows the retrieval of motor representations, its activity being modulated (facilitated or inhibited), in a top-down manner, by the specific demand of the task.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>How are individual words represented in the brain and what cognitive operations are required in order to understand them? According to the classical cognitive theories, word representations are abstract and amodal; in other words, they are independent of the sensory and sensorimotor properties of the objects to which they refer (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Fodor1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pylyshyn1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). Over the last two decades this view has been challenged by evidence to the effect that when people process words related to actions, motor and premotor areas are activated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pulvermller1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> for a review), in addition to the <italic>classical</italic> language-processing areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Shalom1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. For instance, Oliveri <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Oliveri1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while their participants performed a morphological transformation task with action-related nouns and verbs and found that activity in the left primary motor cortex (M1) was enhanced regardless of the word's grammatical class. Using a fMRI study, Hauk <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Hauk1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> showed that silent reading of action words referring to face-, arm- or leg-related actions, activated areas in the left premotor and primary motor cortices differentially. Tettamanti <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Tettamanti1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> reported somatotopic activation in the left premotor cortex - but not in M1 - during passive listening to sentences implying mouth-, hand- or leg-actions. In both of these imaging studies the motor content of the linguistic material was argued to have automatically recruited the motor programs of the described actions.</p><p>These and similar observations have been considered to support the embodied cognition hypotheses of language. Exploiting the Hebbian model of correlational learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Hebb1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, Pulvermuller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pulvermller2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> proposed that action words which are typically learned in the context of action performance are represented in the sensorimotor circuits associated with the implied action, woven within the perisylvian-language areas. The <italic>simulationist view</italic> holds that language understanding is achieved via mental simulation of its content by activating traces of previous perceptual and motor experiences in the perceiver's sensorimotor system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Barsalou1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Rizzolatti1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Even though they assume different underlying mechanisms, i.e. associative learning and mental simulation, both proposals predict that understanding action-language <italic>automatically</italic> entails the motor programs of the corresponding physical actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pulvermller1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Gallese1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Fisher1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> for a review). It follows that a conceptual representation, far from being abstract and symbolic, <italic>is</italic> in fact sensory and motor information.</p><p>If action-language processing activates motor representations automatically, then motor activation should occur even when the participants' attention is diverted from the motor content of a word. However, in a recent fMRI study in which task requirements were controlled, M1 activation was only observed in a task in which participants had to imagine the content of motor phrases explicitly, but not in a letter-detection task with the same items <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Tomasino1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Motor imagery can be triggered even in the absence of explicit instructions, as a strategy to perform any task with sensorimotor components (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Jeannerod1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Kosslyn1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>), and it seems to involve M1 particularly when stimuli evoke movements of human body parts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Ehrsson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Tomasino2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>). This suggests the possibility that M1 is not an integral part of the network for action-word representation but is recruited only to accomplish tasks that critically require the retrieval of sensorimotor attributes associated with words.</p><p>Light can be thrown on the question as to whether motor activation is automatic for action-language understanding by establishing the exact time interval during which M1 activity enhances. Word recognition processing is in fact multistage, characterized by lexical, syntactic, semantic and post-conceptual stages, each with its own specific time course. The hypothesis that M1 is an integral part of word representation implicates that it should be active during the lexical-semantic access, i.e., within 200 ms. Electrophysiological studies seem to support this hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Hauk2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pulvermller3">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Pulverm&#x000fc;ller <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pulvermller3">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while participants listened passively to a stream of action words and pseudo-words, reported that a short-lived activity occurred in frontocentral regions within 200 ms after action words appeared. As the technique used has limited spatial resolution, the authors could only conclude that the processing of action words was maintained by &#x0201c;<italic>different parts of frontocentral cortex, possibly including the prefrontal, premotor and motor areas</italic>&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pulvermller3">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, p. 889). On the other hand, in TMS studies, where the temporal resolution is combined with a more precise spatial resolution, language-induced modulation of M1 was found to be either an early phenomenon (e.g., arising when listening to an action verb, before its presentation was over <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Buccino1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>) or a late phenomenon (500 ms post-word, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Oliveri1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>The present study addresses two questions. First, does motor activation occur <italic>automatically</italic> even when participants perform a task that barely requires the explicit retrieval of the motor content of the word? Second, which of the different stages of word recognition is most likely to activate the left M1? It was possible to provide answers to these questions using TMS, given the intrinsic characteristics of this technique. In fact, when applied supra-threshold to M1 at a given point in time, TMS elicits MEPs from body muscles as a direct measure of motor excitability at that time: the degree of MEP amplitude following TMS is proportionate to the level of M1 activity. Moreover, when TMS is applied to a brain area it delays or disrupts the ongoing behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Harris1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore the question as to whether M1 activity is necessary for action-language processing can be answered through an investigation of how behavioral performance changes when M1-activity is temporarily altered.</p><p>In the present study, TMS was applied to the left hand-M1 and MEPs were recorded from hand muscles while participants performed a semantic task and a syllabic-segmentation task. In the semantic task, participants were instructed to judge whether the presented verbs were action-related, which required explicit retrieval of the representation of the described physical actions. In the syllabic-segmentation task, participants were asked to indicate the number of syllables constituting each verb. The syllabic segmentation primarily entails the sub-lexical features of a word, namely, its orthographical-phonological representation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Carreiras1">&#x0005b;e.g., 26&#x0005d;</xref>. The semantic activation is rather automatic in visual word recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-McLeod1">&#x0005b;e.g.&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Neely1">&#x0005b;27,28&#x0005d;</xref>, but it might be only implicit when the retrieval of word meaning is not necessary in order to perform the task, as is in the syllabic segmentation. If M1 activation is automatic in response to action words, it follows that when participants perform both syllabic segmentation and semantic encoding tasks, MEPs should be greater for action than for non-action verbs.</p><p>Three separate experiments were set up in which TMS was applied at a different point in time after word onset (hereafter, &#x0201c;post-stimulus&#x0201d; will be used synonymously). In Experiment 1, TMS was delivered 170 ms post-stimulus, as the findings of Event-related Potential (ERP) studies indicate that the lexical access for visually-presented words occurs between 100 and 200 ms post-stimulus in posterior regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Sereno1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, while there is evidence for early semantic processes starting prior to 200 ms in anterior regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Hauk2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pulvermller4">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In Experiment 2, TMS was triggered 350 ms post-stimulus, the time when the brain is thought to encode category-specific attributes of word meaning. In fact, a greater negativity (N400 component) in posterior regions was observed over the 300&#x02013;350 ms latency range for motor words compared to visual or abstract words <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Kellenbach1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In a similar latency range, differences in parietal and frontal positivity (P300-<italic>like</italic>) correlate with more fine-grained aspects of action-word meaning, such as the body segments involved in the implied action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pulvermller4">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In Experiment 3, TMS was applied 500 ms post-stimulus, during the post-conceptual stages of word recognition. Manipulating the delay between stimulus onset and magnetic stimulation across experiments served to investigate the time-course of M1 activity when participants performed different linguistic tasks. It also provided a methodological control for distracting/alerting effects and acoustic and tactile sensations associated with TMS. This control is based on the assumption that &#x0201c;non specific effects of TMS will be independent, whereas the behavioral effects will be highly dependent on the precise interval between the event and the stimulation&#x0201d; (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Robertson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> p. 951). This proves to be particularly appropriate for a single-pulse TMS protocol, where stimulus and pulse are not delivered simultaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Walsh1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to MEPs, response accuracy and reaction times (RTs) were collected as measures of the participants' linguistic performance. Thus, besides identifying the mental operations that most likely modulate M1 (explicit or implicit encoding of motor content), insight was gained as to <italic>when</italic> M1 is recruited and <italic>what</italic> the nature of its relationship (causal?) is with linguistic performance.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experiment 1: measurement of M1 activity during lexical-semantic access</title><p>Eleven right-handed, native Italian speakers participated in this experiment. They were exposed to separate blocks of verbs, selected through a pilot study (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), and were instructed to judge whether they were action or non-action verbs (semantic task) and to indicate the number of syllables (three or other number) composing the verb (syllabic task), through a yes-or-no verbal response. Single-pulse TMS was applied to the left hand-M1 170 ms post-stimulus to elicit MEPs in the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle of the right hand. Each task was composed of two blocks, one using TMS and the other sham stimulation as a control.</p><p>Previous TMS studies found an increased hand-M1 activity following rather heterogeneous sets of stimuli, including action verbs related to several body effectors, nouns of manipulable objects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Oliveri1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, or even concrete nouns such as &#x0201c;house&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;collar&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Meister1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar findings have been often explained in the context of an evolutionary scenario whereby language is conceptualized as having evolved from manual communication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Meister1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Rizzolatti2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, evidence exists that M1 is activated by language in a somatotopic fashion, reflecting the different body-effectors of the implied actions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pulvermller1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> for a review). We stimulated the hand-M1, while subjects processed both non action and action verbs. Given the uncertainty about the specific involvement of hand-M1 in language, we considered hand-action and non-hand action verbs as separate levels of the verb-category factor. This yielded a 2&#x000d7;2&#x000d7;3 experimental design with within-subjects factors: (i) stimulation condition (TMS to M1 vs. sham), (ii) task (semantic vs. syllabic), (iii) verb category (hand-action vs. non-hand action vs. non action). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004508-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004508-t002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004508-t003">3</xref> summarize the results of the RT, accuracy and MEP analyses, respectively, for the three experiments.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0004508-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004508.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Mean RTs (ms) in all experimental conditions of Experiments 1&#x02013;3.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0004508-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0004508.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0004508-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Semantic task</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Syllabic task</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hand-act</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-hand act</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-act</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hand-act</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-hand act</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-act</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experiment 1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TMS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">730</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">726</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">853</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">948</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">905</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">909</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sham</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">722</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">705</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">882</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">818</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">844</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">836</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experiment 2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TMS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">781</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">845</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>962</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>1156</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>1166</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1105</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sham</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">774</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">848</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>886</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>1065</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>1101</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1111</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experiment 3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TMS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">627</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">683</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">713</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">843</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">856</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">862</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sham</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">560</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">612</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">683</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">767</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">814</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">762</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label/><p>Tabled mean RTs (ms) following the semantic and the syllabic processing of the hand-action (<italic>Hand-act</italic>), the non-hand action (<italic>Non-hand act</italic>) and the non action (<italic>Non-act</italic>) verbs, during TMS and sham stimulation, in Experiments 1&#x02013;3.

This pattern suggests that the semantic and the syllabic processing of the non-hand action verbs did not elicit motor facilitation and inhibition, respectively, when compared with non-action verbs. No difference was observed in MEP amplitude when the same non-hand action verbs were subjected to the two tasks (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.5), so that the dissociation in MEP amplitude between semantic and syllabic tasks, observed for hand-action verbs at 500 ms post-stimulus, never occurred for non-hand action verbs.</p><p>The results from the between-subject analysis confirmed the findings from the single experiments. The effect of action-verb processing on M1 activity was observed at 500 ms post-stimulus when the hand-M1 activity following hand-action verbs increased during the semantic task, and decreased during the syllabic task. Motor activation associated with action verbs did not occur within 350 ms, i.e. in the time interval for lexical-semantic access. We suggest that the phenomenon of language-induced motor resonance in the hand-M1 took place only after the lexical-semantic access to representations of hand-action verbs, and only when the task explicitly required a full processing of the motor information associated with a word. At the same latency, the syllabic segmentation of the same hand-related items led to an inhibition of the motor activity. The fact that this pattern was observed only with hand-action verbs, indicates that the phenomenon of motor resonance can actually occur in a somatotopic fashion, reflecting the implied-language content.</p><p>We cannot draw any definitive conclusion about the processing of non-hand action verbs. It is possible that different M1-sites, other than the hand-M1 area, were activated when participants processed non-hand action verbs. Since we only stimulated the hand-M1 area, we cannot exclude that any effect we observed when participants processed non-hand action verbs, was due to the activation of motor-sites, other than the hand-M1, spreading through the horizontal cortico-cortical connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Schieber1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, the differential effect on hand-action and non-hand action verb processing when TMS was delivered to hand-M1, suggests that the interaction between action-word meaning and motor system is sensitive to the somatotopic organization of M1, as documented by previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Buccino1">&#x0005b;e.g&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pulvermller5">&#x0005b;24, 38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study challenges the view that action-language processing automatically activates motor representations in the brain. TMS was used to measure the excitability of the participants' left primary motor cortex while they processed action verbs. In order to establish whether M1 activity is causal to language processing, RTs and accuracy were analysed to assess whether action verb processing was modified as an effect of the TMS-interference with this region.</p><p>We found that participants were faster (and better) at processing action verbs (both hand and non-hand related) as opposed to non-action verbs, when they had to access their semantic content but not when a syllable count was required (Experiments 1&#x02013;2). Relative to sham, TMS delayed the semantic judgments of non-action verbs and the syllabic segmentation of action verbs when applied 350 ms post-stimulus (Experiment 2). Although the semantic processing was sometimes faster and more accurate for the hand-action than the non-hand action verbs (Experiments 2&#x02013;3), these two categories interacted similarly with the other factors (i.e., task, in Experiment 1; task and TMS condition, in Experiment 2), and differently with respect to non-action verbs, suggesting that they can be considered as a unique lexical-semantic category. No enhancement of the hand-M1 activity emerged within the response latency for lexical-semantic word processing (Experiments 1&#x02013;2). The hand-M1 activity was modulated by language only when measured at 500 ms post-stimulus. Specifically, relative to non-action verbs, M1 activity increased when participants performed the semantic task with hand-action verbs, and decreased when they performed the syllabic task with the same items (Experiment 3). A similar pattern was not observed for non-hand action verbs: these stimuli elicited the same activation of M1 as the non-action verbs, both in the semantic and in the syllabic task. The MEP analysis with the timing of TMS delivery as a between-subjects factor fully confirmed the findings of the three experiments.</p><p>The overall advantage of action verbs relative to non-action verbs is established by literature on lexical-semantic processing. Kellenbach <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Kellenbach1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, using ERP, found that the earliest effect associated with semantic attributes was elicited by motor words at about 250 ms, compared with abstract and visual words. However, while this study revealed a temporal precedence of the cortical response to motor attributes (versus non-motor attributes), it did not find distinct cortical networks involved in processing the different word categories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Kellenbach1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. This is consistent with the behavioral findings of Laws <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Laws1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, who showed that healthy participants were faster at performing a sentence-verification task with associative-functional (i.e. motor) attributes as opposed to visual attributes, possibly because the former category is characterized by a more extensive and complex cortical representation than the latter. In fact, the motor information &#x0201c;attached&#x0201d; to action-word representations is held to provides a relational context - including path, manner, results and instruments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Talmy1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> - that enriches and instantiates their conceptualization. Hence, action verbs are more concrete than non-action verbs and evoke mental images more strongly. These two dimensions (i.e. <italic>concreteness</italic> and <italic>imageability;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Paivio1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>) are known to affect word retrieval and recognition in both healthy and brain-damaged individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Berndt1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Luzzatti1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>: the more concrete and imaginable the word is, the faster it will be processed.</p><p>In Experiment 2 two further effects were observed: compared with the sham condition, the application of TMS to M1 delayed the RTs of (1) the semantic encoding of non-action verbs, and (2) the syllabic segmentation of action-verbs (both hand and non-hand related). The first effect can be the consequence of accessing the semantics of words with <italic>non-motor</italic> content while a concurrent motor stimulation was provided. In fact, by eliciting overt hand movements, TMS might have acted as an incongruent prime-<italic>like</italic> stimulus when participants processed non-action word content (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pulvermller5">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>). Probably, the lack of facilitation in the semantic processing of action verbs is due to the fact that this was the fastest experimental condition, so that RTs could not be further shortened - with a statistically significant time period - by a congruent stimulation. The second effect is possibly explained by a similar mechanism. In fact, although the syllabic segmentation primarily involved phonological operations, an automatic semantic access occurs whenever a word is read <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-McLeod1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Neely1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. It is also known that when multisensory stimuli co-occur, the information they convey is combined to generate a response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Laurienti1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, a concurrent motor stimulation (or the view of hand movement elicited by TMS) during the processing of action verb, would facilitate the <italic>automatic</italic> activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Neely1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> of the motor information associated with the word. This information, being irrelevant to the task, might have been inhibited before responding, with a processing cost reflected in RTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Eimer1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Lu1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Critically, these effects were observed just at the latency (350 ms) when word's motor or non-motor attributes are supposed to be processed, and were not accompanied by a specific M1 activation, as demonstrated by the MEP analysis. Since the <italic>effects of congruence</italic> are known to occur when stimulus and response or two concurrent stimuli overlap for any dimension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Kornblum2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, in the context of our study, they suggest that language and motor systems actually interact. However, this interaction seems to occur at the stage of processing when abstract, conceptual representations of words and actions are contacted, and does not recruit lower-level motor programs, contrarily to what suggested by the embodied models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Barsalou1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Fisher1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the interaction with the hand-stimulation was similar for hand-action and non-hand action verbs, as if a more symbolic and abstract representation of &#x0201c;motion&#x0201d; associated with the word, rather than a specific motor program, was involved. A similar interaction between M1 stimulation and word meaning even if with earlier delay (i.e., 150 ms), has been reported by Pulverm&#x000fc;ller <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pulvermller5">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, even with methodological differences (i.e., time and intensity of TMS and task demand) relative to our study. In their study, TMS-pulse acted as a semantic prime-stimulus that facilitated (i.e., faster RTs) the lexical decision on hand-words when applied to the hand-M1, and on leg-words when applied to the leg-M1. No measure of M1 activity was available as TMS here was applied sub-threshold. By inducing a priming effect with TMS, this study provides a very elegant evidence of the interaction between language processing and M1 activity. In our study, behavioral and MEP results demonstrated that this interaction can occur even in the absence of a motor activation specific for action language.</p><p>M1 activity increased when TMS was applied 500 ms post-stimulus, only when participants performed the semantic task with hand-action verbs, suggesting that language-induced motor activation depends upon the <italic>explicit retrieval</italic> of the action content of the word. Conversely, in the syllabic task, we observed a decrease of M1 activity following hand-action verbs, possibly reflecting an inhibition of the motor processes that were not required by the task. The increase and the decrease of corticospinal excitability have been previously associated with the facilitation and the inhibition of motor processes respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Koch1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Reynolds1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. In particular, in Koch <italic>et al</italic>.'s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Koch1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> study on functional connectivity of premotor and motor areas, MEP amplitude increased when a response had to be performed, and decreased when a response was one of the possible alternatives but not the correct one, and therefore, had to be suppressed. Interestingly, M1 activity was modulated, in a top-down manner, by higher-level motor areas (i.e. the premotor cortex) <italic>choosing</italic> between alternative responses for satisfying the task demand. Similarly, in our study, the modulation of hand-M1 activity (increase or decrease) resulted to be constrained by whether the task required a full processing of the motor content of the word, that in turn would elicit the motor simulation, or not. The specificity of the effect for hand-action verbs, when only hand-M1 was stimulated, is consistent with the hypothesis that language-induced motor resonance can be actually explained by imagery processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Tomasino1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, evidence exists that M1 is involved in motor imagery in a somatotopic fashion (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Ehrsson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>) and the present findings add that, during language processing, this is accomplished strategically rather than an automatically. The late <italic>co</italic>-occurrence of M1 activation, together with the absence of relationship between this activation and the linguistic performance (RTs and accuracy), critically contribute to this conclusion, against the view that the phenomenon of language-induced motor activity automatically occurs during the lexical and semantic stages of word recognition, and is causal to them.</p><p>Although electrophysiological studies in which participants were exposed to action-language, provided evidence in support of frontocentral activation occurring within 200 ms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Hauk2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Pulvermller3">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, the limited spatial resolution of these techniques did not allow to locate with precision the site of the activations in motor and premotor regions. On the other hand, TMS studies did reveal an involvement of M1 during action-language processing, but left the time and the direction (increase or decrease) of the effect unclear. In fact, consistently with our findings, Oliveri <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Oliveri1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> observed an increased M1 activity 500 ms post-stimulus, while participants produced action words in a transformation task. In contrast, Buccino <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Buccino1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> found that listening to hand-sentences decreased hand-M1 activity and listening to foot-sentences decreased foot-M1 activity. These effects occurred quite early after the onset of the critical action verbs (TMS was indeed delivered when the second syllable of the verb was presented). While this study provide a clear evidence for a specific modulation of action language on M1 activity, the use of a passive task and, therefore, the lack of an online measure of the participants' performance, make it difficult to establish what sort of processing they have been actually performing, when M1 was stimulated. It thus seems premature to conclude, from these results, that M1 is <italic>causally</italic> involved, or what its functional relevance is, in action language processing (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Boulenger1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> for a possible interpretation of conflicting results). Moreover, none of the abovementioned studies tested M1 activity using the same stimuli under different task conditions and at different times during word processing. The latter manipulation was carried out in a TMS study by Meister <italic>et al.,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Meister1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. They measured the left-M1 excitability at different time intervals while participants were reading concrete nouns aloud, and found enhancement only at 600 ms post-stimulus and later. To the best of our knowledge, this time interval is far beyond that for lexical-semantic access and might rather reflect post-conceptual processes elicited by concrete, highly-imaginable items. The existence of post-conceptual stages of language processing has been suggested by the activation of a fronto-temporal network, after the lexical-semantic access, that would sustain a supramodal-contextual integration of different levels of information from different modalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Marinkovic1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of action verbs, the retrieval of conceptual representations would lead to the implicit generation of the mental images associated with them that, in turn, activate M1 (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Kosslyn1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Kosslyn2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>). It is known that this motor imagery is automatically engaged as a strategy to perform tasks with sensorimotor components (here the semantic encoding of action verbs) that &#x0201c;cannot easily be inferred from &#x0005b;&#x02026;&#x0005d; verbal material&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Kosslyn3">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, p. 1337) or, we add, whose recall is more effective using motor simulation. Interestingly, Tomasino <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Tomasino3">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> have shown that sub-threshold TMS to M1, acting as a prime stimulus, facilitated responses in an imagery task with action verbs (judging whether they described hand-rotation) but not in reading and frequency judgments of the same items. This effect extended beyond 750 ms post-stimulus, which is consistent with the lengthy time interval typically associated with motor imagery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Ganis1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Analogously, the time at which language-related M1 activation (500 ms) was observed in the present study, fell fairly within the interval for imagery processes (from 400 ms to 750 or more; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Tomasino2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Iwaki1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>). It is fair noting that, in Tomasino <italic>et al</italic>., the effect began at 150 ms post-stimulus, whereas in our study it was observed only later (after 350 ms). This timing discrepancy can be clearly related to the different tasks employed in the two studies. In Tomasino <italic>et al</italic>., participants were explicitly required to imagine the content of the verbs, so that imagery presumably <italic>started</italic> as soon as the word appeared. In our paradigm, imagery was not explicitly required, and it only kicked in language processing when it proved to be an effective strategy to solve the task.</p><p>We propose that M1 activation would <italic>result from</italic> understanding action verbs rather than <italic>contributing to</italic> it. Studies carried out with critical populations have already suggested that action comprehension can be achieved without mental simulation. Infants and children were able to recognize meaningful actions even when motor simulation was not available because the actions violated the human-body constraints (i.e., impossible actions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Southgate1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>), or did not belong to the human motor repertoire (i.e., the agents were non-human, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Gergely1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>). In addition, double dissociations between action performance and action-language processing have been documented in neuropsychological investigations, suggesting that language <italic>is still possible</italic> with disrupted motor representations and vice versa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-DeRenzi1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Papagno1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>This study demonstrates that the motor activation related to action language is not strictly necessary to its understanding in a narrow sense (i.e., lexical-semantic encoding). This phenomenon is more likely to reflect post-conceptual operations resulting from the explicit retrieval of the motor information associated with action language, when this is critical to solve a task. Future research will clarify the functional relevance of this post-conceptual operation for language understanding. Here, we suggest that the strategic function of motor imagery can provides an insight as to why language processing goes beyond the completion of lexical-semantic encoding and engages the motor system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Participants</title><p>Eleven individuals (7 men, 4 women; mean age &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a; 24.5&#x000b1;4 years) took part in Experiment 1, 14 (5 men, 9 women; mean age &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a; 25.7&#x000b1;3.5 years) in Experiment 2, and 11 (5 men, 6 women; mean age &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a; 26.3&#x000b1;5 years) in Experiment 3.

This set of items was selected following the criteria of the linguistic tradition, whereby action verbs refer to physical acts, and non action verbs (state/psychological verbs) expressed mental processes with no reference to a physical object <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Taylor1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Vendler1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Participants were asked to decide whether the verbs were action-related, and for those that were, to specify the associated body effector among the following alternatives: &#x0201c;upper limb&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;lower limb&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;head&#x0201d; or the &#x0201c;whole body&#x0201d;. The verbs designated as action-related by at least 80&#x00025; of the panel were included in the TMS study, resulting in a final set of 256 items. This set included 128 action-verbs (64 associated with hand motion, e.g. <italic>&#x0201c;mescolo&#x0201d;</italic>, <italic>I stir;</italic> and 64 associated with other body effectors, <italic>&#x0201c;salto&#x0201d;, e.g., I jump</italic>) and 128 non-action verbs (e.g. &#x0201c;<italic>medito</italic>&#x0201d;, <italic>I wonder</italic>), all in the first person singular of the present tense (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004508.s001">Appendix S1</xref>). Fifty percent of the hand-action, the non-hand action and the non action verbs were 3-syllable words; the other fifty percent was divided equally between 2- and 4-syllable words. In addition to length (i.e., number of syllables), hand-action, non-hand action and non action verbs were matched for written frequency (Dizionario di frequenza della lingua italiana, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, C.N.R.- I.L.C.), <italic>t-tests</italic> n.s.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants performed two tasks, a semantic and a syllabic segmentation task, both of which involved action and non-action verbs. In the semantic task, they were asked to judge explicitly whether the verb implied a physical act (e.g. <italic>&#x0201c;mastico&#x0201d;</italic>, <italic>I chew</italic>) or a psychological or mental state (e.g. <italic>&#x0201c;adoro&#x0201d;</italic>, <italic>I adore</italic>). In the syllabic-segmentation task the participants indicated the number of syllables of each verb (3 or different from 3, i.e., 2 or 4). They sat on a height-adjustable chair at approximately 1 meter from a 17&#x02032; CRT screen that displayed the stimuli (font: Arial 38). The height of the chair was regulated to align the participants' gaze with the centre of the display. Each trial began with an acoustic alert of 1500-Hz pure tone followed by a blank screen for 100 ms, which was followed in turn by a fixation cross displayed in the centre of the screen for 1750 ms. A 200-ms blank then appeared. Afterward, the verb was projected in the centre of the screen for 375 ms, which gave the participants sufficient time to read the stimulus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Sereno1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The verb was then substituted by three dots which were projected for 3975 ms, to allow participants to provide the vocal response. On conclusion of this cycle, the next trial began. Each trial lasted 6200 ms from start to finish, sufficiently long to prevent interaction between consecutive TMS-pulses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Robertson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The participants were instructed to give yes-or-no vocal responses to all the stimuli in both tasks. Half of the participants had to give the yes-response to action-related verbs and the no-response to non action verbs in the semantic task, while in the syllabic task the yes-response was to correspond to 3-syllable verbs and the no-response to 2- or 4-syllable verbs. The other half of the participants received opposite instructions. The voice-onset time was recorded as a measure of RTs, using a microphone connected to the external response box of an E-prime PC-controlled system (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Response accuracy was recorded by the experimenter who pressed one of the two mouse keys: the right for yes-responses and the left for no-responses.</p><p>The experiment consisted of four blocks of 64 trials each, for a total of 256 items: a semantic task (64 verbs) and a syllabic task (64 verbs) with TMS, and a semantic task (64 verbs) and a syllabic task (64 verbs) during the sham stimulation. 128 MEPs were obtained for each participant, one magnetic stimulus being applied for each item (the pulses delivered during the two sham-blocks did not elicit MEPs). Action and non-action verbs were presented in a random order within each block, with a short pause after 32 items. Participants were given four practice trials before each block. The order of the two tasks, the mapping of the verb type (action vs. non-action verb and 3 syllables vs. 2 and 4 syllables) to a response (&#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d;), and the verb lists in TMS and the sham condition were all counterbalanced across participants.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Single-pulse TMS protocol</title><sec id="s4d1"><title>TMS site and TMS intensity</title><p>Single-pulse TMS was applied to the left M1, using a Magstim 200 stimulator (Magstim Company, Withland, UK) connected to a figure-of-eight coil (70 mm in diameter). The coil was positioned by mapping the cortical representation of the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI) of the right hand, starting from the Cz reference point of the international 10&#x02013;20 EEG system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Jasper1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref> and moving the center of the coil approximately 6 cm to left, i.e. position C3/C4. The optimal scalp position for the induction of MEPs with the maximum amplitude in the right FDI muscle was individuated for each participant. The coil rested tangential to the scalp surface. The target site was marked on the participant's head with a cosmetic pencil, and the coil was maintained in position by an articulated, metallic arm.</p><p>The TMS intensity was adjusted to 120&#x00025; of the motor threshold at rest, which is defined as the minimum intensity to evoke MEPs with&#x02265;50 &#x000b5;V peak-to-peak amplitude in the relaxed FDI, in 3 out of 5 consecutive pulses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Rossini1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. The mean motor threshold for participants of Experiment 1 was 37.6&#x000b1;1.4&#x00025; of the maximum stimulator output. The means in Experiment 2 and 3 were 38.7&#x000b1;1.4 and 38.9&#x000b1;2.2 respectively. Participants were instructed to keep their right arm/hand and head motionless and the muscle relaxation was monitored throughout the entire experiment to check for involuntary movements. A visual feedback consisting of a muscle twitch, i.e. an abduction movement of the right forefinger, was always present after actual TMS delivery.</p><p>The same intensity of magnetic pulses was used for both the TMS (2 blocks) and the sham stimulation (2 blocks). In the latter condition, the coil was held perpendicularly to the surface of the scalp over the left M1, so that it mimicked the noise and the mechanical vibration of TMS but no magnetic stimulation actually reached the scalp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004508-Robertson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The order of the two stimulation conditions was counterbalanced across subjects according to Latin square. Participants were not informed whether they were going to receive TMS or sham stimulation. The sham stimulation was used as a control for the diverting effects of the acoustic and tactile sensations associated with TMS. However, the intensity of these peripheral effects is typically lower in the sham condition than in TMS and only TMS elicits muscle twitches and stimulates facial muscles. To reduce the possibility of participants to make an a priori distinction between the two conditions, we selected only participants who had been never exposed to TMS before. In fact, after the experiment, when we debriefed them, they all reported the sensation that &#x0201c;something was going on&#x0201d;, even during the sham condition. This was only a very general precaution for preventing the effect of awareness from crucially affecting the performance. More to the point, the nonspecific effects of TMS were controlled by manipulating the timing of TMS delivery in the three different experiments, and by performing the between-subjects analysis of the MEP data.</p><p>The same protocol was adopted for all three experiments, the only difference being the timing of the TMS application. In Experiment 1, TMS pulses were triggered 170 ms after the onset of each stimulus. In Experiment 2, TMS was applied 350 ms post-stimulus and 500 ms post-stimulus in Experiment 3. TMS-induced MEPs were recorded by a pair of gold surface electrodes placed over the FDI (active electrode) and the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger (reference electrode). The ground electrode was placed on the ventral surface of the right wrist. The electromyographic (EMG) signal was amplified and filtered (bandpass 20 to 2000 Hz) through a Grass amplifier (P122 Series) and recorded with the Biopac system (MP150 model) at a sampling rate of 5 kHz. EMG data were transferred to a personal computer for offline analyses of the MEPs using Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA). The delay of TMS delivery in each experiment was replicated in the sham condition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Analysis</title><p>The same statistical analyses on RT, accuracy and MEP data were performed in Experiments 1&#x02013;3 as the experimental design itself was identical. Practice trials, trials with RTs shorter than 100 ms and longer than 2500 ms, and those in which the participants made errors in the syllable count or in semantic judgement (according to the pilot study), were excluded from the offline analysis. Mean RTs and accuracy were submitted to a 2&#x000d7;2&#x000d7;3 analysis of variance (ANOVA), with TMS condition (left M1 vs. Sham), task (semantic vs. syllabic) and verb category (hand-action vs. non-hand action vs. non action) as within-subjects factors.</p><p>In the MEP analysis the peak-to-peak amplitude (mV) of each MEP was computed by an automatic Matlab script and then normalized. MEP amplitudes inferior to 0.1 mV were not considered. Z-scores were calculated using mean and standard deviations of each mini-block of 32 trials. Given the high variability of individual MEPs, Z-scores were used to increase the comparability of the mini-blocks, both within and between participants. Normalized MEP peak-to-peak amplitudes were subjected to a 2&#x000d7;2 repeated measures ANOVA with task (semantic vs. syllabic) and verb-category (action hand-action vs. non-hand action vs. non-action) as within-subject factors.
