We sought to determine the current state of appointment provision in Wales and any changes resulting from the need to meet indicators in the new GMS contract. We undertook a postal questionnaire study of practice managers in all general practices in Wales.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Valid responses were received from 396/505 (78.4%) practice managers. 361 (93.1%) practices reported that they had achieved the target for 2004/05. 104 (26%) practices reported that they were 100% open access/advanced access. The most frequent changes reported in response to the new GMS contract were offering more open or advanced access slots (237, 60%), more GP phone consultations (167, 42%), introducing a telephone triage system (100, 25%), introducing a minor illness clinic (76, 19%), and employing or training a nurse practitioner (59, 15%). 83% practice managers believed that patients were able to get an appointment at the time they need it either 'all of the time' or 'most of the time', and 70% that patients were able to get an appointment with the GP of choice either 'all of the time' or 'most of the time'.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This survey has demonstrated the current extent of appointment provision in Wales, and how changes have been driven by incentives. Whether these changes are in the best interests of either patients or doctors, or both, remains to be seen.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Access to primary care professionals is a key NHS priority,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and there is increasing evidence that patients value improved access to primary care.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] In Wales, an objective for the next decade stated in 2001 was to promote universal and faster access to services,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and an important Welsh Assembly Government policy document outlined the following target: 'patients will be able to access an appropriate member of the primary care team within 24 hours of requesting an appointment and much sooner in an emergency'.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]</p><p>Over the past few years, many practices have adopted either a complete open access or advanced access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] model of appointment provision. Open access is usually taken to mean regular surgeries that are not bookable in advance and are often run in combination with booked appointments. Advanced Access is an approach to appointment systems based on measuring and predicting demand each day and matching capacity to demand so that patients can book on the day of their choice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] However many practices that purport to use Advanced Access do not use the model's key principles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] However there remains contention about the relative advantages and disadvantages, as assessed in different ways from different perspectives, to these systems, especially for certain groups of patients. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] There has been a range of other initiatives aimed at improving access generally. These include: telephone consultations; telephone triage; nurse led minor illness clinics; and the introduction of nurse practitioners and health care assistants, however the evidence for their widespread use remains contentious.</p><p>The new General Medical Services (nGMS) contract for general practice was introduced in 2003.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] The nGMS contract includes financial incentives to practices that achieve an access target; through both the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QoF) (50 bonus points), and the enhanced service category, which differs in each of the four UK countries. Practices in Wales submit an annual plan to their LHB outlining their intention to improve patient access to services. These individual, practice-based plans are then agreed and monitored, and funding of &#x000a3;5000 per average practice size paid. Each LHB has a responsibility to carry out validation checks to ensure that information provided by practices is correct.</p><p>We sought to determine the current state of appointment provision in Wales and any changes resulting from the need to meet indicators in the nGMS contract. We were keen to compare the experience in Wales to that of demonstrated by surveys in England and Northern Ireland.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] We undertook this by asking practice managers to answer a brief questionnaire about access in their own practices. We believe that this is of international importance given the variation in the provision of access and in the use of incentives to change practice systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a postal questionnaire survey of all practice managers in Wales. We developed and piloted a structured questionnaire that asked questions about the current appointment provision, changes since the nGMC contract, complaints and aggression, their own opinion and their opinion of others' views of the appointment provision, and factual data about the practice. Questions and response options were amended after piloting.

Of the others, four fifths offered same day appointments, three fifths up to one week in advance, and one third more than a month in advance. The commonest changes to appointment provision reported were more open access slots, and more systematic use of GP telephone consultations. A large majority of practice managers believed that their current systems enable patients to get an appointment at the time they need it, and with their GP of choice. Practice managers reported no changes in either verbal complaints or aggression relating to appointment provision. They perceived that GPs, receptionists and patients all regarded their appointment systems positively. Open or advanced access was associated with smaller practice list size.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>For a postal questionnaire study we achieved an excellent response rate, which was greater than the English survey (245/391, 63%), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] but lower than the Northern Irish survey (94%), although this only had 59 respondents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] Contributory factors to this may have included: a topical and relevant subject, a short and well-designed questionnaire; the fact that practice managers are rarely consulted in research studies of this nature; and the questionnaire coming from a fellow practice manager. The list size per practice and per GP are in keeping with other data from Wales, and the sample responding to the questionnaire was similar in these respects to practices in Wales overall. Data from the MDSi Contract Manager database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.msdinformatics.com/ClinPCT.htm"/> reported that 92.8% of practices in Wales achieved the access bonus. This figure is very close to the data reported here, again suggesting that the sample responding to the questionnaire was similar in these respects to practices in Wales overall. The weaknesses are those of any questionnaire: we were limited to fixed response options, and had to assume a certain truth in the responses, taking the results at face value. We also cannot be sure that there is no systematic bias from the non-responders. Lastly, this was only a survey of practice managers and was not therefore able to address the view of patients or other health professionals. Their view may differ considerably. One of our questions (question 2), was, in retrospect, slightly ambiguous, and the findings from this question must be interpreted with additional caution. Additionally the wording of 'open' and 'advanced' access may have caused some confusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/discussion of the findings within the context of the literature</title><p>This questionnaire survey has demonstrated the current extent of appointment provision in general practices in Wales and changes that have occurred since the implementation of the nGMS contract. The contract has led to a move towards more open/advanced access appointments and more telephone consulting. Whilst this may help practices achieve QoF access targets, its effect on the overall quality provision of general practice remains unknown. The effect of incentives on changing appointment provision has been demonstrated, and is similar to the findings from Northern Ireland.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] The level of access to appointments in general practices in Wales, and the views of practice managers have been demonstrated. There is an issue about who access best serves: the patient or the practice, and the trade off between faster access and quality of care (e.g. longer consultations and reduced continuity of care).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] There is also an issue about whether patients actually get appointments when they need rather than want them, and whether they are with their doctor of choice. For example working patients and those with complex chronic conditions may express a clear preference for pre-bookable appointments rather than faster access. This issue has not been resolved by the nGMS contract. It may be that some practices are choosing not to fully achieve the access target because they feel it is neither in their, nor their patients' best interests.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>The original idea for the study came from AE.
