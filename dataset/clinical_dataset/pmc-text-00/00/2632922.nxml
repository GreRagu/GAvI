Although data on expression, position and function of human genes are available, their true integration still represents a challenge for computational biology, hampering the identification of regulatory mechanisms. We carried out an integrative analysis of genomic position, functional annotation and promoters of genes expressed in myeloid cells. Promoter analysis was conducted by a novel multi-step method for discovering putative regulatory elements, i.e. over-represented motifs, in a selected set of promoters, as compared with a background model. The combination of transcriptional, structural and functional data allowed the identification of sets of promoters pertaining to groups of genes co-expressed and co-localized in regions of the human genome. The application of motif discovery to 26 groups of genes co-expressed in myeloid cells differentiation and co-localized in the genome showed that there are more over-represented motifs in promoters of co-expressed and co-localized genes than in promoters of simply co-expressed genes (CEG). Motifs, which are similar to the binding sequences of known transcription factors, non-uniformly distributed along promoter sequences and/or occurring in highly co-expressed subset of genes were identified. Co-expressed and co-localized gene sets were grouped in two co-expressed genomic meta-regions, putatively representing functional domains of a high-level expression regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Co-expression is essential to sustain normal function of cells and tissues. Genes can be co-expressed because they are co-regulated, have similar promoters, share combinations of functional regulatory sequence motifs binding transcription factors (TF), and/or they are co-localized. Genes could be co-localized because they are close to each other on a linear chromosome, thus being under the influence of the same regulators (e.g. enhancers acting locally on a limited chromosomal region) and/or under the effect of local control, possibly based on specific chromatin modifications. Genes could be considered co-localized also because they are preferentially located in a given functional district of the three-dimensional interphase nucleus, i.e. chromosome territories, thus being exposed to a particularly concentrated mixture of regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). On the other hand, part of co-expressed genes (CEG) are functionally related and tend to be under the control of similar gene circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5">2&#x02013;5</xref>). Thus, the integrated study of co-expression, co-regulation, co-localization and functional similarity may help in understanding basic and general rules governing genomic expression and may allow identifying mechanisms and specific switches of expression regulation in considered biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Haematopoiesis is an ideal biological model for studying regulation of gene expression in cellular differentiation since it represents a plastic process where multipotent stem cells gradually limit their differentiation potential, generating different precursor cells that finally evolve in eight distinct types of terminally differentiated cells. Myelopoiesis is the part of haematopoiesis leading to differentiation of myeloid cell lineages (erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, granulocytes and mono/macrophages). In a recent study on myelopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), the analysis of the correlations between expression patterns of genes, their biological roles and their physical position in the human genome led to the identification of (i) chromatin domains containing clusters of genes relevant for specific myeloid lineages and (ii) chromosomal regions with low transcriptional activity that partially overlap genomic clusters related to non-haematopoietic functions.</p><p>In this article, we address the study on gene expression regulation by integrating analyses performed at multiple levels. Specifically, the analysis of gene co-expression and co-localization is integrated with the analysis of promoter sequences.</p><p>The search for DNA motifs in gene promoters is a challenging problem that has been of longstanding interest in computational biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). Numerous pattern discovery programs, which are based on different algorithms and methodologies, have been proposed and coded in stand-alone or web applications [e.g. MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), GibbsSampler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), Weeder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), WordSpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), COOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), MOST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and RSAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>); for a critical review see Tompa <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>)].</p><p>We introduce a novel methodology for the identification of putatively relevant motifs in gene promoters. The method is composed of a cascade of non-standard analytical procedures, and it is conducted on top of a MySQL database organizing different levels of interconnected data. In particular, this approach allows:<list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>Finding, in a selected set of promoter sequences, motifs over-represented as compared with a biologically meaningful background model.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Analyzing promoter sequences by regions. Since several functional motifs have strong position-related prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), accounting for positional distribution in promoter sequences could refine the search for biologically meaningful motifs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Integrating motif over-representation with additional, biologically relevant properties of motifs, such as similarity with known-functional sequences.</p></list-item></list>The application of this computational approach to the analysis of expression regulation during myeloid cell differentiation allowed identifying a greater number of significantly over-represented motifs in the promoters of co-expressed and co-localized genes when compared with those of simply co-expressed genes. All results are stored in a dedicated website where details of promoter sequences analyses can be browsed, along with gene transcriptional and functional characteristics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compgen.bio.unipd.it/MoDi/">http://compgen.bio.unipd.it/MoDi/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Myelopoiesis gene expression data</title><p>The myelopoiesis data set consists of gene expression data for 24 samples generated from 8 different types of myeloid cells. Specifically, RNA from CD34 + , haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC), myeloid precursors (myeloblasts, monoblasts, erythroblasts and megakaryoblasts) and terminally differentiated cells (monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils) was analysed using Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133A, as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Robust multi-array average (RMA) procedure was applied to raw signals (i.e. CEL files) in order to background adjust and normalize microarray intensities and to generate gene expression values. Raw data of 24 considered samples are publicly available as a GEO series (GSE12837). Probe&#x02013;gene relationships were obtained using GeneAnnot-based custom Chip Definition Files with a total of 11 446 unique custom probesets (gahgu133a_1.1.1.cdf; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.xlab.unimo.it/GA_CDF/">www.xlab.unimo.it/GA_CDF/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). For each of eight cell types, RMA expression values in corresponding replicate samples were averaged, and then, the data matrix was standardized per gene, obtaining a vector of eight expression values for each gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Reference set of human genes: genomic localization and promoter sequences</title><p>A reference set of human genes was collected by selecting all EntrezGene human entries corresponding to trustable RefSeq nuclear genes with Known, Reviewed or Validated Status and excluding Mitochondria, Plasmids, Plastids and Pseudogenes. Each EntrezGene ID was matched to the corresponding mRNA and EST sequences of UCSC Genome Browser. The genomic region including all of these sequences was selected as the reference gene locus and used to predict the exact Transcription Start Site (TSS) position. Gene loci whose genomic position could not be unambiguously determined according to this procedure were discarded. Then, the promoter sequences were retrieved, each spanning from 1000 bp upstream to 100 bp downstream of the predicted TSS (&#x02212;1000, +100). These sequences constituted the reference set of gene promoters (REFGP).</p></sec><sec><title>QT clustering of myelopoiesis expression data: groups of Co-Expressed Genes (CEG)</title><p>In order to identify sets of co-expressed human genes (CEG) along myelopoiesis, we first selected genes varying in tissue/cell type-dependent manner, and then quality threshold (QT) clustering was used to group CEG. The Shannon entropy (<italic>H</italic>) was adopted as measure of expression variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and used to rank and filter genes. The genes selected as variably expressed in myeloid cells were then grouped by the similarity of expression profile. Spearman correlation was adopted as a similarity measure and cluster analysis was performed by the QT clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) of TMEV software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tm4.org/mev.html">http://www.tm4.org/mev.html</ext-link>). QT clustering was adopted since it allows setting <italic>a priori</italic> thresholds for cluster quality, such as minimum values for the correlation between gene pairs within the cluster and for the number of genes per cluster.</p></sec><sec><title>Local Correlation Score (LCS): Co-Expressed chromosomal Regions (CER)</title><p>We searched for chromosomal regions including CEG, which could represent functional domains of higher-level gene expression regulation. The search for co-expressed chromosomal regions (CER) was based on the Local Correlation Score (LCS), a statistic for local correlation of gene expression patterns. The significance of local enrichment in CEG was evaluated using locally adaptive procedure (LAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The correlation between expression patterns of genes localized in a region (LCS) was computed using a sliding window whose width was set equal to twice <italic>&#x003bc;<sub>id,c</sub></italic> + 2<italic>&#x003c3;<sub>id,c</sub></italic>, where <italic>&#x003bc;<sub>id,c</sub></italic> and <italic>&#x003c3;<sub>id,c</sub></italic> are, respectively, the mean and standard deviation of log-transformed intergenic distances, and are computed independently on each chromosome <italic>c</italic>. In details, for each gene contained in the gene expression data matrix and located at specific position <italic>j</italic> on chromosome <italic>c</italic>, Spearman correlation was computed pairwise for all of the neighbouring genes located in the window <italic>j</italic> &#x000b1; <italic>n<sub>c</sub></italic>, with <italic>n<sub>c</sub></italic> equal to <italic>&#x003bc;<sub>id,c</sub></italic> + 2<italic>&#x003c3;<sub>id,c</sub></italic>. The LCS was defined as the median correlation among all of the pairwise correlation coefficients. If no gene was contained in the window except the central gene at position <italic>j</italic>, the LCS was set equal to zero. Then, the significance of positive or negative local peaks in LCS values was evaluated using LAP. LAP procedure consists of three main steps: (i) adoption of a statistic for each gene contained into the gene expression data matrix; (ii) adaptive bandwidth smoothing of the statistic after sorting the statistical scores according to the chromosomal position of the corresponding genes and (iii) application of a permutation test to identify chromosomal regions with significant positive or negative peaks of the selected statistic, with a <italic>q</italic>-value correction for multiple tests. The LAP procedure was applied to LCS statistic and allowed the identification of CER with significantly high (+CER) or significantly low (&#x02013;CER) levels of local correlation among gene expression patterns. These genomic regions include groups of genes co-expressed and co-localized that were considered for subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Inter Regional Correlation Score (IRCS): Co-expressed Chromosomal Meta-Regions (CEMR)</title><p>Distinct chromosome arms and chromatin domains may occupy discrete territories in the cell nucleus, whose topological characteristics are essential for gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Therefore, we searched for groups of CER showing similar expression patterns. Previously selected +CER were clustered according to the similarity of expression, quantified in terms of IRCS. IRCS between two regions CER<italic><sub>A</sub></italic> and CER<italic><sub>B</sub></italic> was defined as the median value of all pairwise Spearman correlations between the <italic>n</italic> genes of CER<italic><sub>A</sub></italic> and the <italic>m</italic> genes of CER<italic><sub>B</sub></italic>. QT clustering based on IRCS was used to group different CER into CEMR. These CEMR may be indicative of functional domains characterized by a high-level expression regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Framework for motif discovery in promoters sequences</title><p>A computational framework was developed for identifying putative regulatory motifs in promoter sequences of selected groups of genes (SELGPi) as compared with REFGP. The framework comprises methodologies and software for completing a number of analysis steps, including (i) approximate patterns enumeration, (ii) significance scoring of over-representation, (iii) generation of motifs and (iv) their comparison with known regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Data obtained from different levels of analysis are recorded in a MySQL database and integrated with expression data.<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Scoring exact patterns over-representation in a selected set of gene promoters. For each SELGi, the corresponding SELGPi is divided in overlapping sequence windows. Approximate patterns occurring in at least 30% of the considered promoters are used to select the corresponding group of exact patterns. Then, within the groups of exact patterns, only patterns showing more occurrences than expected by chance: their total number of occurrences is used to compute over-representation <italic>P</italic>-value of the whole group of exact patterns. If the <italic>P</italic>-value is significant after Benjamini FDR correction, they are clustered together with other over-represented patterns that identify over-represented motifs corresponding to the specific SELGPi.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn948f1"/></fig></p><sec><title>Groups of exact patterns over-represented in promoter windows</title><p>Full-length promoter sequences of the REFGP are divided into overlapping sequence windows, with window width and overlap defined by the user. For each window, sequence patterns of a given length are examined. The occurrences (in both strands) of each pattern and the sequences that contain each pattern are counted and stored in MySQL database tables, thus providing an estimate of expected frequencies in the REFGP.</p><p>Then, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, for each of the selected groups of gene promoters (SELGPi), a specific sequence window is considered, and approximate patterns occurring in at least <italic>s</italic>-sequences are identified with SPEXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). We considered ungapped patterns with two, not lateral, variable positions, in which any of the four nucleotides is allowed, e.g. ANATGNTCGT, N={A,C,T,G}). However, the evaluation of over-representation of the approximate patterns may produce many false positive and false negative results. In fact, approximate patterns can match both over-represented and under-represented exact patterns, thus biasing the over-representation statistic. Therefore, each approximate pattern is first associated to the group of corresponding exact patterns, which are subsequently filtered to select only those occurring in at least two different sequences and being more represented in SELGPi than expected by chance, according to the estimated frequency in the REFGP. Thus, each approximate pattern is associated to the group X containing a set of <italic>h</italic> exact patterns satisfying these conditions and the total occurrences <italic>n</italic> of these exact patterns in SELGPi are compared to the total expected frequencies, according to REFGP. Finally, the probability of observing more than <italic>n</italic> occurrences, for the group X within the SELGPi, is evaluated using the binomial distribution as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The false discovery rate (FDR) is then used to control false positive results due to multiple statistical tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>In this way, for each SELGPi (and for each combination of pattern length and sequence window), a given number of significantly over-represented groups of exact patterns is identified.</p></sec><sec><title>k-medoids clustering of significant patterns generates motifs</title><p>For each SELGPi, all the exact patterns belonging to any over-represented group X are then compared and assembled into motifs with <italic>k</italic>-medoids clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), using the TAMO package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In order to assess the pairwise distances between patterns, we adopted the end-space free alignment algorithm, whose peculiarity is avoiding penalization for mismatched overlapping prefixes and/or suffixes of aligned sequences. Since <italic>k</italic>-medoids clustering requires an <italic>a priori</italic> determined number of clusters <italic>k</italic> and is a heuristic process to find the optimal value of <italic>k</italic> (i.e. the minimum number of clusters producing a sufficiently good pattern partitioning), the clustering analysis was repeated with increasing values of <italic>k</italic> until partitioning optimality was less or equal to a user-defined threshold. Partitioning optimality (<italic>d<sub>k</sub></italic>) was defined as the maximum of the distances between cluster medoids and individual cluster members. To stabilize results, for each incremental value of <italic>k</italic>, the <italic>k</italic>-medoids clustering was performed 100 times. Then the partitioning having the minimum <italic>d<sub>k</sub></italic> was selected as the best among the 100 trials.</p><p>Finally, to obtain a single over-represented motif corresponding to a cluster of over-represented patterns, all patterns within a cluster were multialigned using ClustalW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) with a stringent gap open penalty (100) to avoid gaps in the resulting consensus sequence. A matrix of nucleotide frequencies in motif positions was computed from patterns alignment result and visualized with a sequence logo.

This high level of gene expression regulation was taken into account as well, and we looked for CER along myelopoiesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, green panel). The analysis of CER was carried out using the LCS statistic. LCS is computed for each gene position, considering the correlation with neighbouring genes within a specific window, as described in Materials and methods section. Window width was selected independently for each chromosome, taking into account the different gene density of chromosomes. The average window width was 3.66 Mb, with values ranging from 0.72 Mb (chr 19) to 5.69 Mb (chr 13), thus including on average 5.7 genes per window. Then, by applying LAP to LCS statistic (<italic>q</italic>-value &#x02a7d; 0.01), we identified chromosomal regions, including at least five genes per region, with significantly high (positively correlated regions, +CER) or significantly low correlation among gene expression patterns (negatively correlated regions, &#x02013;CER). We identified 34 +CER, including a total of 922 genes covering 211.84 Mb (7% of the human genome), and 4 &#x02013;CER, with a total of 53 genes covering 16.77 Mb (0.54% of the human genome) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).<fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Genomic positions of co-expressed regions in the human chromosomes.

Therefore, we also investigated the relationship between the physical distance and the correlation of adjacent genes. This analysis showed an apparent inverse correlation between the distance of adjacent gene pairs and the correlation coefficient of corresponding expression patterns.

Therefore, as detailed in Materials and methods section, IRCS as similarity measure and QT clustering (with maximum distance set to 0.7) were used for grouping +CER into meta-regions (CEMR).

For each of these gene sets, the corresponding group of gene promoters was considered and analysed to discover significantly over-represented motifs in SELGPi, as compared with a large group of 15 138 promoters (REFGP, being the background model), in order to identify putative regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Each selected set of genes is related to a specific expression pattern and likely to a specific biological role in a given differentiation context.

Among all the considered genes, only two promoters, belonging to genes included in the same gene set, show an overlap of a number of nucleotides close to 1100, which is the length of considered promoter sequences: this is a pair of divergent genes with a unique bidirectional promoter (PDCD10, programmed cell death 10 and SERPINI1, neuroserpin precursor).

Platelets contain thromboxanes that are derived from arachidonic acid and are relevant for platelets function, including their aggregation and activation. The same gene set also includes pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP) that is involved in platelet production and other genes involved in other haematopoietic cells differentiation, such as Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (BTK), that is also expressed in platelets, and monocyte to macrophage differentiation-associated (MMD).</p><p>Finally, CEG33 genes that are characterized by expression peaking in erythroblasts, and the putative regulators GATA1 and LMO2, identified according with motif discovery results, were mapped on Biocarta pathways. GATA1 and AHSP [also named erythroid-associated factor (ERAF)] are included in the gene set and are known to interact in the pathway of the Haemoglobin's Chaperone.

Furthermore, the gene set includes other genes involved in the differentiation of other haematopoietic cells such as PRKDC (protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide) that is relevant for B cells differentiation and is also expressed in myeloid cells or DLK1 (delta-like 1 homolog) that is involved in T cells differentiation.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present work, we considered different levels of gene expression regulation in human myelopoiesis, integrating the study of promoter-based and position-related control of transcription, of &#x0223c;10 000 genes, in myeloid cells and identifying sequence elements in gene promoters with putative regulatory function along differentiation.</p><p>A novel methodology for the identification of putative regulatory elements in promoter sequences was developed, aiming at identifying motifs over-represented in a selected set of promoters, as compared with a background model built according to a reference set of promoters. Different lines of evidence support the fact that promoter regulatory elements are functional in a given biological context according to their position relative to the TSS. Tabach and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) proved that positional-dependent TFBS tend to be located in the region close to and upstream the TSS. Thus, promoter sequences were divided in partially overlapping windows, which were considered individually for the selection of over-represented patterns.</p><p>The framework for the identification of regulatory motifs integrates a number of steps, including approximate patterns enumeration, calculation of exact patterns over-representation, and generation of motifs by clustering sequences of exact patterns. The first step of the analysis is the enumeration of approximate patterns found in the selected group of promoters. Biologically, functional binding sites are degenerated and the over-representation of exact patterns is a subtle signal, often too difficult to identify with statistical techniques. The adopted statistical measure that was described by Van Helden <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) was based on the binomial distribution, allowing associating a <italic>P</italic>-value to the observed occurrences of patterns or motifs. We adopted the FDR to guarantee a global control over false positives. One improvement of our framework relies on the fact that the over-representation significance was calculated neither for a single exact pattern, nor for a simple approximate one. Instead, we considered the subgroup of exact patterns matching a given approximate one, capable of maximizing the significance of global over-representation of the group in the selected set of gene promoters, as compared with the background model. This approach was finally chosen considering that: (i) the over-representation signal of each exact pattern is subtle and strongly dependent from expected number of occurrences, in turn dependent from pattern length; (ii) the over-representation of a pattern including fully variable positions is not informative because it may match exact patterns both over- and under-represented, the latter obscuring likely biologically meaningful signals. In the last phase of the analytical pipeline, clustering of all exact patterns belonging to over-represented groups gives rise to over-represented motifs, which are eventually compared with known TFBS and further analysed. Thus, identified motifs are associated to different attributes, such as non-uniform distribution along promoters, accounting for position-dependent function, and occurrence in promoters of highly CEG, possibly indicating that the presence of the motifs is crucial for determining specific expression behaviour. Non-uniformly distributed motifs occurring in promoters of highly CEG are probably the most interesting candidates for a functional role along myelopoiesis.</p><p>A very large set of putative promoter sequences (&#x0223c;15 000, i.e. a good representation of the whole set of human promoters) was used as background model for computing patterns over-representation. Using real promoter sequences as background model allows identifying motifs specifically associated to a given set of promoters (of genes sharing expression, positional or functional characteristics) avoiding motifs that are simply highly frequent in human promoter regions. This approach reduces the number of false positives or uninteresting results, i.e. repetitive sequence elements and structural elements constitutively present in most human promoters.</p><p>Following a classic assumption that &#x02018;genes co-expression implies, at least in part, co-regulation&#x02019;, 44 groups of promoters of highly CEG were identified and associated each to a specific expression pattern in myeloid cells. Then, combining expression and positional information, chromosomal regions with significantly high positive LCS were identified (CER), comprising &#x0223c;10% of the genes and 7% of the genome. These could represent functional domains of high-level gene expression regulation.</p><p>It is worthwhile noting that regions including genes with negative correlation of expression are fewer and smaller than positively correlated regions. Moreover, an apparent inverse correlation exists between the distance of adjacent gene pairs and the correlation coefficient of corresponding expression vectors. Confirming the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), in the whole human genome, genes positively correlated tend to be close to each other, whereas negatively correlated genes tend to be separated by larger intergenic regions.</p><p>The results of the motifs discovery analyses are available in a dedicated website representing the first collection of putative regulatory motifs acting during myeloid cells differentiation. Expression profiles of genes belonging to a specific gene set are displayed together with information regarding gene annotation, gene-ontology, and promoter sequences. Motifs found in the selected gene set are shown together with all the information on attributes derived from the post-processing of motif discovery results. Results about CERs and CEMRs are also available as a resource based on the DAS, and can be accessed by querying the MyDas server. This represents an expandable framework in which additional results of novel analyses on extended myeloid cells datasets may be easily integrated.</p><p>Significantly, over-represented motifs were identified in 80% of considered gene sets, with 90 motifs per gene set in average. About 20% of over-represented motifs are similar to known TFBS, and all of the considered motifs binding TF, with a known role in myeloid cells differentiation, were found over-represented in at least one gene set. About one-third of identified motifs are non-uniformly distributed along promoters and another one-third is represented in promoters of genes with highly correlated expression profiles; the intersection of these categories accounts for 11% of all over-represented motifs.</p><p>Motifs discovery results detailed in the website could be profitably used to gain biological interpretation since the various characteristics of each motif are shown together with gene expression and function information. For example, focusing on CEGs, with at least one motif non-uniformly distributed and occurring in a subset of genes with high correlation, it could be noticed that in the promoters of CEG5 three over-represented motifs were found, all similar to the known binding site of nuclear transcription factor Y alpha (NFYA), which was previously reported to be involved in myeloid cells differentiation and to be expressed in erythroid and myeloid progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37 B38 B39">37&#x02013;39</xref>). The expression pattern of CEG5, peaking in erythroblasts, and megakaryoblasts is coherent with previous reports. In addition, the analysis of Gene Ontology functional classes, and IPA analysis also highlighted the existence of biologically meaningful relationships among CEG5 genes as well as the enrichment in biological process categories related to the synthesis of thromboxanes, and therefore, essential for platelets function. Furthermore, CEG11 shows the highest expression level in monoblasts, and is enriched in genes involved in immune, defence and inflammatory response, as inferred from Gene Ontology functional classification. Among its over-represented motifs that are as well non-uniformly distributed and occurring in highly CEG, we found a motif similar to the binding site for CEBPB, i.e. a well known transcription factor playing a role in the differentiation and functionality of mono/macrophages and also granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40 B41 B42">40&#x02013;42</xref>). From another point of view, motifs discovery results can help identifying possible regulatory circuits in myeloid differentiation, involving specific transcription factors and/or combination of them. For example, GATA1 (GATA binding protein 1/globin transcription factor 1) has an established role in the differentiation of megakaryocytes, erythrocytes and also eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Motifs possibly recognized by GATA1 are present among over-represented motifs of CEG33 and CEG42, including genes with, respectively, erythroblasts- and eosinophils-specific expression patterns, as well as among motifs of CEG34 and CEG44, comprising genes with megakaryoblasts-specific expression patterns. Moreover, among these gene sets, CEG33 and CEG44 share predicted binding sequences for LMO2 (LIM domain only 2), a transcription factor with a role in haematopoiesis, with previously described interactions with GATA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). In particular, it can interact with GATA1 and is involved in erythroid differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). It is worth noticing that CEG44 includes a limited number of genes, and therefore over-represented Gene Ontology functional classes cannot be identified with statistical significance. Nevertheless, the mapping of CEG44 genes on KEGG pathways and additional functional information allowed enlightening biologically meaningful relationships between the selected genes. Then, focusing on SPI1 (spleen focus forming virus (SFFV) proviral integration oncogene spi1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), which has a role in influencing myeloid cells differentiation towards granulocytes (neutrophils), monocytes and also eosinophils cell lineages, we found over-represented motifs corresponding to its known-binding sites in many CEG and CER gene sets. Among them, there are CEG20, CEG24 and CEG42, with an eosinophils-specific expression pattern, as well as different CER including genes with high expression in neutrophils (such as CER3, CER4, CER5, CER15, CER20, CER22 and CER24). Furthermore, these CER are enriched in genes involved in development and immune system related functional categories according to the analysis of Gene Ontology functional classes. In addition, motif discovery results were integrated with biologically relevant information concerning regulatory and metabolic pathways as well as with databases describing molecular interactions such as IPA. The integration of computational results and biological data allowed verifying that complex relationships can be enlightened in the selected gene sets as described in the Results section.</p><p>When observing the variety of expression profiles associated to the different CEG sets and to positive CER gene sets, it is evident that the CER profiles can be fitted to a smaller number of expression patterns, showing peculiar expression behaviours in differentiation lineages, and that their cross comparison allows the identification of only two groups of CER gene sets, i.e. the CEMR. These findings allow supposing that mechanisms controlling expression of specific chromosomal regions, which may involve epigenetic modifications, could be particularly important in specific differentiation lineages. The expression patterns of the two CEMR can indeed be related to cell contexts representing early and late differentiation stages, and gene co-expression in CER and CEMR gene sets might be related to different levels of epigenetic regulation.</p><p>Genes adjacent each other on a chromosome can be under the influence of the same, locally acting, regulators and/or under the effect of local epigenetic control, based on specific chromatin modifications. Moreover, additional levels of epigenetic regulation may act on genes located on a given functional district of the three-dimensional interphase nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Indeed, the resultant gene expression derives from different layers of transcriptional regulation, mediated by epigenetic mechanisms and by specific combinations of transcription factors binding sequences, within gene promoters. In this view, we performed the comparative study of promoters of CEG, CER and CEMR with the final purposes of identifying putatively functional regulatory elements, involved in specific differentiation switches and lineage choices in myeloid cells, and formulating hypotheses on the relative role of genetic and epigenetic regulation of transcription during myelopoiesis.</p><p>More motifs were found in the groups of promoters of CER gene sets than those of promoters of CEG with comparable cardinality. However, since CERs share basically two expression profiles, we wondered if the total number of identified motifs in CER gene sets could have been overestimated and if the same motifs were actually found over-represented, by parallel analyses, in different CER gene sets. To assess whether the higher number of motifs found in CERs was due to a high number of shared motifs between CERs, we built a list of non-redundant motifs found in the two supersets containing all results of CERs and all CEGs by pairwise comparison of motifs IUPAC consensus sequences. In the two supersets, non-redundant motifs were 16% fewer than original motifs (1653 and 2754 non-redundant motifs were identified in CEG and CER, respectively) and the ratio between motifs found in CER and CEG gene sets remains unchanged if non-redundant motifs are considered. Thus, conversely, the number of non-redundant motifs found over-represented in CER gene promoters remains considerably higher than that found in CEG gene promoters. This result is in accordance with the fact that few significantly over-represented motifs were found in CEMR gene sets: the gene promoters of different CER sets, grouped by similarity of expression in a CEMR set, do not share numerous similar motifs.</p><p>The motifs discovery approach is characterized by the independent analysis of different promoter regions, and by the posterior analysis of distribution of over-represented motifs, accounting for the role of binding site position in determining its function. The identification of motifs found in subgroups of genes highly co-expressed and comparison of detected motifs with known TFBS is expected to increase the completeness of results. The statistical analysis adopted for identifying putative biologically relevant motifs was both stringent, adopting false discovery rate, and capable of identifying subtle over-representation signals. Indeed, the analysis is conducted on subgroups of exact patterns for which the significance of global over-representation is maximized in the selected set of gene promoters, as compared with the background model based on a numerous set of real gene promoter sequences.</p><p>In conclusion, the integrated analysis of co-expressed and/or co-localized sets of genes proved to be effective in enlightening biologically relevant results, including findings related to the differentiation of various myeloid lineages, which are coherent with previous knowledge of the considered, complex biological system. This work constitutes an important improvement in the methodologies for characterizing gene expression regulation of entire genomic regions biologically relevant for a specific process.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn948/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>University of Padova (CPDA065788/06, CPDR074285/07); Fondazione CARIPARO (Progetti Eccellenza 2006); MIUR (2007CHSMEB_002 to S.F and S.Bo); Italian Association for Biology and Genetics (mobility fellowships program 2007 to F.F.); Consorzio Interuniversitario per le Biotecnologie (mobility fellowships program 2007 to F.F.).
