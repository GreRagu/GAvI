Microcontact printing is used to stamp the substrate with octadecyltrichlorosilane to define the active regions. The substrate is then back-filled with PEG-silane {[[2-methoxypoly(ethyleneoxy)]propyl]trimethoxysilane} to define passive regions. A microfluidics device is subsequently affixed to the substrate to deliver proteins to the active regions, with as many channels as there are proteins to be patterned. Examples of trifunctional surfaces are given which present three terminating functional groups, i.e., protein 1, protein 2, and PEG. These surfaces should be broadly useful in biological studies, as patch size is well established to influence cell viability, growth, and differentiation. Three examples of cellular interactions with the surfaces are demonstrated, including the capture of cells from a single cell suspension, the selective sorting of cells from a mixed suspension, and the adhesion of cells to ligand micropatches at critical shear stresses. Within these examples, we demonstrate that the patterned immobilized proteins are active, as they retain their ability to interact with either antibodies in solution or receptors presented by cells. When appropriate (e.g., for E-selectin), proteins are patterned in their physiological orientations using a sandwich immobilization technique, which is readily accommodated within our method. The protein surface densities are highly reproducible in the patches, as supported by fluorescence intensity measurements. Potential applications include biosensors based on the interaction of cells or of marker proteins with protein patches, fundamental studies of cell adhesion as a function of patch size and shear stress, and studies of cell differentiation as a function of surface cues.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>la8006525</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>la-2008-006525</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>We demonstrate the creation of surfaces which present multiple functionalities by serial application of microcontact printing (&#x003bc;CP) to define the regions of interest on the substrate, followed by filling of those regions by affixing the substrate as a lid over microfluidic (MF) channels. The functionalization of the micropatterned surfaces can be generic, ranging from surfaces that present alkanethiols of different chain lengths and terminal functionalities to surfaces with PEG-functionalized regions and regions presenting proteins and antibodies. We focus on the latter class of functionalities for biological application. The method allows the definition of discrete active regions for protein adsorption surrounded by inert PEG-functionalized regions and the delivery of distinct proteins to the active regions from MF channels. Thus, surfaces presenting more than one protein in distinct patches surrounded by inert PEG-functionalized regions can be created.</p><p>It is well established that many cellular functions depend on the size of protein patches with which the cells interact. For example, Ismagilov and collaborators recently reported studies of blood clotting in which surfaces that present micrometer-scale patches covered with tissue factor, an initiator of the clotting response, are placed in contact with blood plasma. Blood clotting was reported only for patches above a critical size.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>) For adherent cells grown in patterned arrays, cellular responses such as cell viability, adhesion, or motility have been demonstrated to depend strongly on the size and shape of the cell-covered regions for a variety of cell types, including hepatocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> neurons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> fibroblasts,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>) epidermal cells,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) and endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> Stem cell differentiation and signaling have been shown to depend strongly on the diameter and pitch of adhesive islands which control the colony diameter.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>) Recently, cell culture dishes micropatterned with a PEG derivative that resists protein and cell attachments have been shown to confine and guide the motion of 3T3 fibroblasts and human microvascular endothelial cells.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>)</p><p>For other systems, the role of the protein patch size has yet to be established, but it is likely to play a role. For example, the patch size should influence the adhesion of free-flowing cells such as blood platelets or leukocytes. These cells bind to each other or to bounding surfaces through interaction with a variety of proteins, as has been demonstrated by studies of the rolling and adhesive behavior of cells on randomly functionalized surfaces.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) Control over the area and spacing of discrete functionalized patches in these systems should enable the accurate quantification of binding events under physiological flow conditions. Patterned surfaces are also exploited in cell-based biosensors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup></p><p>Surface patterning techniques are commonly divided into serial and parallel methods. In serial methods, regions on the surface are defined by either placing a functionality serially in desired locations or serially removing a functionality to expose regions of otherwise protected substrate, which are later filled with another molecule of interest. Typically, serial methods include dip pen nanolithography (DPN), e-beam lithography (EBL), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), collectively referred to as scanning probe lithography (SPL) techniques. In DPN, AFM tips are inked with a solution of the material to be transferred. The material on the tip transfers to the substrate while the probe is scanned across the surface, probably being mediated by the water meniscus formed by capillary condensation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>) Alternatively, the probe can &#x0201c;scratch&#x0201d; the surface and selectively remove material such as polymers, liquid crystals, bilayers, resists, and SAMs.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) EBL has been used to selectively ablate PEG and backfill with a protein or other functionality,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) to locally &#x0201c;deactivate&#x0201d; a protein,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) or to create gold patterns that constrain protein distribution.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) These methods are well suited for high-precision (sub 100 nm) patterning of individual features. They have also been adapted to create multifunctional surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> Drawbacks of these methods include that they are time-consuming (requiring days to weeks to pattern a surface over millimeter length scales), that they have been demonstrated primarily on metallic substrates (e.g., Au, Cu, etc.), and that they require significant investment in equipment.</p><p>Parallel techniques allow the rapid definition of patterned regions to be functionalized and simultaneous introduction of functionalities to regions of interest. They are useful for patterning high-density features over large areas, often in applications when sub 100 nm precision is not crucial (although features at this length scale are achieved by nanoimprint lithography(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>)). Photolithographic techniques, including soft lithography or &#x003bc;CP, are parallel methods. They are inexpensive, not extremely material specific, and readily adopted for creating micrometer-scale features over large areas (&#x0003e;cm<sup>2</sup>). These techniques are also benign to many proteins of interest and can be used on glass or polystyrene substrates, which are often the materials of choice in cell patterning and protein adhesion studies. Methods to automate these processes have been explored.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>)</p><p>Lithographic methods to create patterned bifunctional surfaces which present two molecules or chemical moieties in well-defined regions have been used for some time,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> although new techniques continue to emerge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> One common technique exploits a photolithographic resist to protect regions of the surface during aninitial functionalization.

Functionalities of interest are introduced individually in the separate channels; they adsorb or chemisorb onto the substrate as they pass through the channel.

However, this technique does not allow the formation of discrete patches of functionalized regions, which have been shown to be important in many biological studies as described above. Currently, microarray techniques, in which species of interest are deposited serially in spots on substrates, are used to create discrete patches presenting different functionalities.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref>)</p><p>In this work we present a hybrid method to create substrates with discrete patches containing distinct functionalities, as depicted schematically in Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. &#x003bc;CP is used to define the size and shape of the active features comprised of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) on glass, which promotes protein adsorption, surrounded by passive regions functionalized with [[2-methoxypoly(ethyleneoxy)]propyl]trimethoxysilane (PEG-silane)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref>) to prevent protein adsorption as shown in the left panel of Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. MF channels are used to deliver distinct species (proteins, antibodies, surfactants) to the active regions, as depicted in the right panel of Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The number of patches filled is dictated by the width and contour of the MF channel containing that species. We demonstrate the creation and utility of these surfaces. First, trifunctional surfaces presenting micropatches of two proteins surrounded by inert PEG-functionalized regions are created. Such trifunctional surfaces are then used to capture and pattern cells from a single cell suspension and to sort and pattern cells from a mixed suspension. Finally, the role of the patch length scale in binding of LS174T colon carcinoma cells under prescribed flow conditions is demonstrated.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Creation of multifunctional surfaces by serial use of &#x003bc;CP (left panel) and MF (right panel).

The slide was left at room temperature for 30 min and developed with MF-CD-26 (Rohm &#x00026; Hass). The slide, half bare and half patterned with photoresist, was incubated with 0.1% OTS solution for 1 min and rinsed with hexane. The photoresist was then stripped off by sonication in acetone. The slide was successively incubated with 20% PEG-silane for 1 h at 90 &#x000b0;C, FITC&#x02212;anti-human IgG Fc for 15 min, and finally 5 &#x003bc;g/mL E-selectin Fc for 30 min. The remaining areas were blocked with D-PBS containing 1% BSA for 30 min. The glass slide thus presented both 5 &#x003bc;m square patches and uniform regions of E-selectin surrounded by inert PEG.

First, trifunctional surfaces are created presenting two proteins in distinct discrete patches surrounded by inert PEG-functionalized regions. In the second and third examples, respectively, trifunctional surfaces are used to capture and pattern cells from a single cell suspension and to sort and pattern cells from a mixed suspension. In the fourth example, a bifunctional surface presenting a binding ligand in discrete patches is used to identify critical length scales and associated shear stresses in the adhesion of suspension cells.</p><p>In the first example, a trifunctional surface presenting discrete patches of green fluorescent FITC-labeled anti-IgG antibody and red fluorescent PE-conjugated anti-IgG antibody surrounded by continuous PEG-functionalized regions was created, as shown in Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a&#x02212;d. &#x003bc;CP was used to define 45 &#x003bc;m square OTS-covered regions surrounded by PEG-silane; the OTS-covered regions were filled using an MF network with 200 &#x003bc;m wide channels, through which the FITC-labeled anti-IgG antibody was introduced, and 100 &#x003bc;m wide channels, through which the PE-labeled anti-IgG antibody was infused.

Anti-CD44 mAb was selected because the adhesion of CD44-expressing LS174T colon carcinoma cells to host cells and/or ECM proteins such as fibrin(ogen) is implicated in cancer metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">72</xref></sup> Hence, these cells adhere specifically to anti-CD44 mAb&#x002bc;s, so a surface presenting such antibodies could be used for cell capture. In Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, we illustrate this concept with a surface that presents 65 &#x003bc;m square patches presenting either anti-CD44 mAb or FITC&#x02212;BSA surrounded by PEG-silane on glass. Subsequently, a suspension of SNARF-stained LS174T colon carcinoma cells was placed on the micropatterned slide and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 37 &#x000b0;C under static conditions. As shown in panels a and b of Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the cells bound extensively and selectively to the anti-CD44-covered regions. Both the BSA- and PEG-covered areas remained relatively cell-free; i.e., about 10% of the cells were bound nonspecifically to these regions. As a negative control, micropatterned surfaces were prepared presenting no antibody, but patterned with OTS regions passivated with BSA and PEG patches in geometries similar to those of the patterned substrates used in the cell binding experiments. These substrates did not bind cells, save for some weak nonspecific binding in the BSA-covered regions (data not shown). Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c shows an example of the continuous pattern of the cells created in the absence of the &#x003bc;CP step. This example illustrates the ability to trap cells from a static adhesion assay on discrete patches of the anti-CD44 antibody, with only weak nonspecific adhesion to the nonactive area. Furthermore, the ability to capture cells using an antibody immobilized to a surface provides evidence that the biological activity of the antibody is preserved in these assays.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>(a, b) Fluorescence images of 65 &#x003bc;m squares of patterned FITC-labeled BSA (green) and SNARF-stained LS174T colon carcinoma cells (red) surrounded by PEG-functionalized regions (black).

To this end, a glass slide was patterned with anti-CD162 and anti-CD66de mAb&#x002bc;s in discrete patches surrounded by inert PEG-functionalized regions. CD162, also known as P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), is selectively expressed on the surface of different leukocyte subpopulations, including PMNs.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) CD66e is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family (CEA) and represents one of the most extensively used clinical tumor markers due to its limited expression in adult normal tissue and cells and high expression levels in a wide variety of tumor cell types.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref>) Due to the specific nature of antibody&#x02212;antigen interaction, we were able to sort PMNs and LS174T cells into discrete patches by employing two different experimental protocols. In both cases, PMNs adhered extensively to the anti-CD162-coated patches driven by the high affinity of this antibody for PSGL-1. In the first protocol, a mixed suspension of cells was allowed to incubate with the micropatterned surface under static (no-flow) conditions (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). In the second protocol, the cell suspension was perfused over the micropatterned surface under controlled kinematic conditions by the use of a parallel plate flow chamber which mimics the shear environment of the circulatory system. The adhesion of PMNs on these patches was observed dynamically in the flow experiments; colony-like islands of cells consisting exclusively of PMNs on the anti-CD162 patches formed within minutes after the initiation of the fluid flow (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Sorting of a 4:1 mixture of CMFDA-labeled LS174T colon carcinoma cells (green) and SNARF-stained PMNs (red) on anti-CD162 and anti-CD66de mAb micropatterned glass slides surrounded by PEG-functionalized regions.

As expected, LS174T cells bound avidly to the anti-CD66de-decorated patches (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Microscopic observations reveal the presence of a small number of PMNs captured on the anti-CD66de-coated microregions (i.e., PMNs represented 25.5% of the cells adhered to these microregions in the static experiments and 19.7% under flow conditions) and minimal nonspecific binding of PMNs to the PEG-functionalized regions. These observations motivated the characterization of CD66de expression levels on the surface of both PMNs and LS174T cells using direct single-color immunofluorescence assay. CD66acd is not expressed by the LS174T cells,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref>) whereas CD66e was abundantly expressed on the surface of these cells, as shown in Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a. CD66acde is moderately expressed on the PMN surface (see Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Consequently, the presence of PMNs on the anti-CD66de-coated patches could be attributed primarily to the CD66de expression detected on their surfaces. We have thus demonstrated herein the ability of this technique to sort cells by their capture to appropriate antibody-coated patches driven by the high affinity of the biologically active antibodies for their respective receptors on the cells.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Surface densities of CD66 and CD162 molecules on PMNs and LS174T cells measured by flow cytometry.

The dual-patterned nature of the substrate allowed direct comparison of the extent of colon carcinoma cell adhesion to the E-selectin-decorated patches versus uniformly E-selectin-coated regions. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy utilizing a PE-conjugated anti-E-selectin mAb was employed to compare the E-selectin site density on the micropatches to that on the uniformly coated region.

The cell adhesion studies were performed in a flow chamber that allowed control over the wall shear stress level; both the micropatterned regions and uniformly coated regions could be observed. At a wall shear stress level of 0.70 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>, LS174T cells tethered and rolled along the uniformly functionalized substrate with an average rolling velocity of 4.52 &#x003bc;m/s (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c), but were apparently unretarded by the micropatches (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d).</p><p>Lowering the wall shear stress to 0.35 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> resulted in an expected decrease in the average cell rolling velocity to 2.93 &#x003bc;m/s (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) in the uniform region (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>e). Most importantly, the decrease in wall shear stress resulted in intermittent cell tethering to the patches, with cells pausing, spending an average residence time of 0.64 s, and subsequently detaching into the flowing stream (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>f). These results are summarized in Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Furthermore, a fraction of these LS174T cells were able to rebind to E-selectin patches located downstream of the initial contact domain. This transient tethering behavior is distinctly different from that of the stable rolling behavior observed in the uniform surface control and reveals a dependence of the cellular adhesion event on the length scale of the functionalized regions. As a negative control, micropatterned surfaces were prepared lacking E-selectin, but rather presenting FITC&#x02212;anti-human IgG Fc and PEG patches in the same patterned geometries and uniform regions used in the cell adhesion experiments. These substrates failed to capture cells under shear flow (data not shown), thereby confirming the requirement of E-selectin in specific cell tethering events. In this example, we illustrate the ability to immobilize the protein E-selectin in its physiological orientation on a substrate using a sandwich immobilization method. The protein maintains its biological activity as evidenced by flow-based adhesion assays and fluorescence microscopy experiments. The shear-dependent cell tethering events identified in this example can be attributed to the length scale of the receptor patch. Moreover, this assay can be used to extract important kinetic parameters of receptor&#x02212;ligand binding.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Average Rolling Velocities of LS174T Cells Tethered to Uniform E-selectin and Average Residence Time of LS174T Cells over Patches of E-selectin at Shear Stresses of 0.70 and 0.35 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;<xref rid="tbl1-fn1" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="char" char="."/><col align="left" char=""/><col align="char" char="&#x000b1;"/><col align="left" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border:none;" align="char" char=".">&#x000a0;</th><th colspan="2" align="center">average rolling velocity (&#x003bc;m/s)<hr/></th><th style="border:none;" align="center">average residence time (s)</th></tr><tr><th style="border:none;" align="center" char=".">shear stress (dyn/cm<sup>2</sup>)</th><th style="border:none;" align="center">hemodynamic free cell</th><th style="border:none;" align="center" char="&#x000b1;">cells tethered to the uniform surface</th><th style="border:none;" align="center">cells bound to the patch area</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td style="border:none;" align="char" valign="top" char=".">0.70</td><td style="border:none;" align="left" valign="top">554 &#x000b1; 26</td><td style="border:none;" align="char" valign="top" char="&#x000b1;">4.52&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.44</td><td style="border:none;" align="left" valign="top">no binding</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td style="border:none;" align="char" valign="top" char=".">0.35</td><td style="border:none;" align="left" valign="top">nd<xref rid="tbl1-fn2" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></td><td style="border:none;" align="char" valign="top" char="&#x000b1;">2.93&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.26<xref rid="tbl1-fn3" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref></td><td style="border:none;" align="left" valign="top">0.64 &#x000b1; 0.08</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl1-fn1"><label>a</label><p>At least 30 cells were tracked for calculating the average rolling velocity under each condition, and the mean is reported with the standard error.</p></fn><fn id="tbl1-fn2"><label>b</label><p>nd = not determined.</p></fn><fn id="tbl1-fn3"><label>c</label><p><italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c;0.01.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Our technique builds upon other technologies in which proteins can be immobilized and retain their ability to participate in molecular recognition events.

The potential utility of this method has been demonstrated in four examples. These examples point to the versatility of the technique, in which an arbitrary number of proteins can be presented in patches with highly reproducible surface coverages, as supported by fluorescence intensity measurements. These proteins retain their activities, as substantiated by their ability to interact with either antibodies in solution or receptors presented by cells. We have further shown that these patches can be used to selectively sort cells, with potential in the sensing and diagnostics of disease states, or to study the biophysics of cellular adhesion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>M.G., C.A., and Z.T. contributed equally to this work.
