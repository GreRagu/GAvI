Various imaging modalities, including conventionaldacryocystography (DCG), computed tomography (CT),magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear scintigraphy,are available &#x02013; each with its own advantages and limitations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p><p>Conventional DCG by itself is capable of demonstratingthe patency as well as intrinsic pathology of lacrimal drainagesystem. However, it is limited in its ability to offer informationextrinsic to the nasolacrimal drainage system and provideslimited soft tissue detail.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>Although dacryoscintigraphy, using Technetium-99mpertechnetate solution, is a physiological study of the lacrimaldrainage system, it is limited by suboptimal resolution and lackof easy availability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></p><p>MRI scan may show the lacrimal sac as clearly as CT scan, butit does not show the canaliculi and has the same limitations asa standard CT scan in viewing canalicular pathology. Injectionof gadolinium is needed to visualize the canaliculi.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Though itcan be performed without exposure to ionizing radiation orcontrast by using saline for filling the lacrimal system, the testis expensive, gives poor bony details, has a long acquisitiontime with image degradation in case of patient movement andis not recommended as a routine examination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>Plain or intravenous (IV) enhanced CT does not image thesuperior, inferior and the common canaliculi. They can beidentified by placement of topical contrast medium either intothe conjunctival sac or by cannulation of the punctum. High-resolution thin sections (1 to 2.5 mm slice thickness) CT imagingin the axial and/ or coronal plane is helpful in assessing thosestructures intimately associated with the nasolacrimal drainagesystem.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> By combining CT with DCG, the relationship betweenthe nasolacrimal drainage system and the surrounding softtissue and bony structures can be clearly demonstrated. Itdefines the lacrimal system anatomy, facilitates preoperativeplanning and intraoperative decision making.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p><p>CTDCG scores better in displaying the smaller componentsof the lacrimal system, the superior, inferior and commoncanaliculi, than MRDCG.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> It is also more sensitive than MRDCGin distinguishing high-grade stenosis from total obstruction ofthe nasolacrimal drainage system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p><p>The increasing capabilities of thin-slice helical CT, with two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructionand shorter acquisition time, now offer excellent imagingresolution and patient compliance.</p><p>CTDCG technique was first described in detail in 2002 byFreitag <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Since then, only limited reports of this techniquehave been described. Only few studies of CTDCG havebeen reported using dye instillation technique instead of thecannulation technique.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> To the best of our knowledge, no suchstudy has been reported from India. We studied the indications,technique and diagnostic utility of helical CTDCG.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Retrospective analysis of 13 patients who underwent CTDCGduring the period January 2003 to December 2005 at a tertiaryreferral center was done. Detailed history including history ofprevious lacrimal surgery, trauma or sinus disease was elicited.Lacrimal system evaluation, including position and appearanceof the punctum and lid, tear meniscus height evaluation,presence or absence of medial canthal mass, regurgitation onpressure on the sac or canaliculus, dye disappearance test andsyringing, was performed. CTDCG was performed in patientsin whom there was uncertainty as to the cause of epiphora onclinical examination or in the presence of medial canthal mass.Only those patients who underwent surgical interventionafter CTDCG were included in the study to enable correlationbetween the CTDCG and intraoperative findings. Patients withknown allergy to iodine or contrast media were precluded fromundergoing the study.</p><sec><title>Technique</title><p>The study was performed on a Siemens Esprit helical CTscanner. Three hours starvation was advised to patientsrequiring administration of IV contrast for evaluation of medialcanthal mass. With the patient in supine position, 3-mm thickplain axial helical CT scan (4.5 millimeter table feed; 1.5 pitch)of the paranasal sinus and orbit was taken from the hard palateto the roof of the orbit to look at the bony canal, calcificationor dacryolith.</p><p>CTDCG was performed by administration of contrastby cannulation or instillation in the conjunctival cul de sac.Contrast media used was iohexol (Omnipaque, G E HealthcareSystems, 300 mg iodine /ml). It is a low-osmolar, water-soluble,nonionic, iodinated contrast. It was used in 1:1 dilution, dilutedwith distilled water.</p><p>When the procedure was performed by instillation of contrastin the conjunctival cul de sac, one to two drops per minute, pereye, were instilled for 5 min, followed by CT scanning.</p><p>Cannulation was performed by an ophthalmologist onlywhen the drop method failed to adequately demonstrate thelacrimal drainage system. When CTDCG was performed bycannulation, topical 0.5% proparacaine was instilled. Pre-DCGirrigation and expression of the lacrimal sac was done to flushout accumulated secretions within the duct system, which maylead to interpretive difficulties, including improper estimationof the size of the lacrimal sac or misdiagnosis of obstructionproximal to a stenosing lesion due to the retained secretions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>Approximately 2 mm of the radiopaque contrast material wasdrawn into a syringe, connected to a 26 gauge lacrimal cannulawith a plastic hub and tubing and the system was clearedof any air bubbles. In bilateral imaging, two cannulae andtubing with a &#x02032;Y&#x02032; connector were used. The inferior punctumwas dilated with a lacrimal dilator. The lacrimal cannula wasthen placed into the inferior canaliculus just far enough toremain stable during the study, and the tubing was taped tothe patient&#x02032;s face. Care was taken to avoid placement of thecannula far into the inferior canaliculus, which may createartifacts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Then, 0.5 to 1.0 ml of contrast medium was injectedeach side. IV contrast was used in cases with medial canthalmass.</p><p>The patient was scanned in a supine position for axialimaging, and prone position for direct coronal imaging. Directcoronal imaging was done only when patient movement duringthe axial scanning resulted in poor quality of reformation. Two-millimeter thick helical CT with 2-mm table feed (one pitch),130 kV, 110 mA and FOV 150 to 180 was performed with areconstruction interval of 1 mm. The data acquired in the axialplane was reformatted into 3D and 2D coronal and obliquesagittal planes along the long axis of the lacrimal drainageapparatus.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four patients were male and nine were female. Age range was 5to 62 years (median age 26 years). Seven patients presented withwatering and six with medial canthal masses. Of the patientswith medial canthal mass, two patients had firm mass and fourpatients had cystic mass [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>Syringing was patent in 4 of these 6 patients with a medialcanthal mass. In the 7 cases without a medial canthal mass,syringing was patent in 2. Three patients had history oftrauma, of which 1 patient (patient no. 5) had sac surgerytwice elsewhere, with persistence of symptoms. Ten patientsunderwent CTDCG with the drop technique, with contrastinstillation in the conjunctival cul de sac. Three patientsunderwent cannulation and injection of contrast into thelacrimal drainage system, since the instillation techniquefailed to demonstrate the dye in the lacrimal passages in thesepatients. Bilateral DCG was performed in 1 of the 3 patientsevaluated by cannulation technique and in 7 of the 10 patientswho underwent instillation technique CTDCG. High-qualityimages with sharp delineation of the lacrimal drainage systemwere obtained in all cases, including the normal passages [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig.1</xref>]. Patient no. 2 presented with a medial canthal mass, andCTDCG demonstrated smooth displacement of the canaliculidue to the mass and a patent lacrimal drainage system [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig.2</xref>] CTDCG showed mass lesion displacing the sac in 5 cases,nasolacrimal duct obstruction in 6 cases and mucocele in 2 cases[<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. CTDCG in patient no. 5 showed fracture of inferiororbital rim with displaced fragment of bone and also fracturesinvolving maxillary sinus, nasal and zygomatic bones. Thesac was distended and laterally displaced with no flow intothe nasolacrimal duct (NLD) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>]. In patient no. 8, CTDCGshowed ill-defined soft tissue thickening in the medial canthalarea with a hyperdense lesion suggestive of foreign body orbony fragment. There was irregular opacification of the sacwith proximal NLD obstruction [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>].</p><p>Five patients underwent mass excision by medial orbitotomy,and seven underwent dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR). Onepatient (patient no. 11) with partial NLD obstruction onCTDCG with findings of delayed dye appearance into theinferior meatus underwent primary silicone tube intubation.Histopathology of the excised mass revealed inclusion cyst intwo patients, and one each had apocrine cyst, benign reactivehyperplasia and lymphoma [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>By combining CT scan with DCG, the relationship between thenasolacrimal drainage system and the surrounding soft tissueand bony structures is delineated better. Performing the CTscan prior to use of lacrimal contrast is important in delineatingcalcifications such as dacryoliths and for accurate evaluation ofbony injuries and is recommended in all cases.</p><p>CTDCG is indicated in investigating patients with epiphoraafter the clinical examination suggests a mechanical obstruction.It helps to (l) describe the level of the obstruction; (2) evaluatewhether the obstruction is complete or incomplete, intrinsicor extrinsic to the duct and (3) determine the cause of theobstruction. The suspected obstruction may be associated withvarious clinical conditions, including congenital obstructions,supernumerary canaliculi, lacrimal fistula or diverticula,concretions (dacryoliths), neoplastic or inflammatoryprocesses or post-treatment changes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> CTDCG offers maximuminformation to allow the appropriate choice of treatmentin these cases. In our study, seven patients presented withwatering and without a medial canthal mass. The cause andexact site of obstruction was clearly identified with the help ofCTDCG in these patients. The DCG findings correlated wellwith intraoperative findings.</p><p>In patients with failed DCR, the location of the bony opening,soft tissue scarring, bony regrowth, secondary stenosis of thecanaliculi,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> synechia between the ostium and nasal septum canbe imaged by CTDCG.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Similarly, anatomic variations in thenasal cavity, turbinates or nasal septum and the possibility ofencountering ethmoid sinus air cells during DCR can be noted.CTDCG best shows the relationship of surgical clips, suturesand fixation plates to the nasolacrimal sac or the osteotomysite. Only one patient in our study had history of DCR in thepast (patient no. 5). This patient was found to have a residualsac with proximal NLD obstruction along with facial fractureson CTDCG [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>]. She underwent a successful DCR surgerywith silicone tube intubation.</p><p>In patients with lacrimal outflow symptoms after trauma,CTDCG offers additional benefits of more exact localizationof the lacrimal drainage system fractures, bone displacements,location of previously placed miniplates, wire or silastic sheets.In our study, three patients had history of trauma, of which onepatient (patient no. 5) had sac surgery twice elsewhere withpersistence of symptoms. CTDCG in this patient showed multiplefacial fractures with proximal NLD obstruction. Another patientwith history of trauma showed proximal NLD obstruction withsuspected medial canthal foreign body or bony fragment onCTDCG (patient no. 8). She was found to have bony fragmentin the medial canthal area, which was removed intraoperativelyduring DCR. Patient no. 12 with history of trauma showed medialcanthal thickening with superiorly displaced opacified sac andproximal NLD obstruction on CTDCG [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>]. She underwentsuccessful DCR with medial canthal reconstruction.</p><p>All patients presenting with an inferomedial orbital masslesion are candidates for CTDCG. The information about theexact relationship of the mass to the sac, the possible nature ofthe mass and secondary effects on the lacrimal system offeredby CTDCG helps in making treatment decisions. In our study,six patients presented with medial canthal masses. The possiblenature, location, extent and secondary effects on the sac andcanaliculi were well seen on CTDCG. Five patients had massexcision and one underwent DCR for lacrimal sac mucocele [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig.6</xref>]. On histopathology of the excised mass, findings suggestedinclusion cyst (two patients); and apocrine cyst, benign reactivehyperplasia and lymphoma (one patient each).</p><p>The etiology of functional nasolacrimal duct obstruction(FNLDO) and its relation to sinonasal disease has also beenbetter appreciated on a CTDCG.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> None of the patients in ourstudy had associated sinusitis or nasal pathology, unlike thelandmark study by Freitag <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> where 50% of the studiedpatients had some degree of sinus disease.</p><p>CTDCG is contraindicated in pregnant women and inpatients with a known allergy to iodine. Also, we do notrecommend CTDCG in cases with acute dacryocystitis, due toreasons related to patient comfort in undergoing the procedureas also the extensive soft tissue edema and possible maskingof important diagnostic radiological signs. Children anduncooperative patients require sedation for this procedure. Fourof the patients in our study were children, the youngest being5 years of age (patient no. 8). With appropriate preparation, allof them underwent successful CTDCG by instillation method,except one patient (Patient no. 3) who needed cannulation andunderwent the same without any complications.</p><p>Though oil-based contrast media fill the NLDS better,are less irritating, are undiluted with tears and offer betteropacification, they have potential disadvantages. Extravasationcan lead to severe granulomatous inflammation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> especiallyin post-traumatic and post-inflammatory cases. Their higherviscosity makes instillation in the conjunctiva impractical.Residual fluid in the sac causes oil-based contrast media toform globules, giving a false impression of a polycystic sac ordiverticula.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Water-soluble contrast is safe and effective;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> andhence we used iohexal, a water-soluble dye, in our study. Thepatient may complain of slight dryness,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> burning or irritationof the eye due to contrast, which is short lived.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> None of ourpatients had such complaints. The contrast has an unpleasanttaste but is safe to swallow.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p><p>Instillation of contrast in the conjunctiva gives better patientcomfort, tolerance, acceptance and ease of procedure, is morephysiological and avoids artifacts due to the cannula placement.It also eliminates risk of iatrogenic injury from cannulationor injection of contrast medium and does not require trainedpersonnel for cannulation. It can be performed in childrenwithout sedation. In our study, 10 of the 13 patients underwentCTDCG by instillation technique, cannulation being neededonly in 3 patients due to inadequate visualization of contrast inthe lacrimal drainage system following instillation study.</p><p>In a patent system, the contrast medium will immediatelydrain from lacrimal sac into the nose and nasopharynx. A delayin dye appearance is interpreted as partial obstruction and wasseen in two patients (patient no. 1 and patient no. 11). Bothunderwent successful DCR operation.</p><p>Initial or subsequent cannulation of the superior punctummay be appropriate when there is difficulty with cannulationof the inferior punctum or when further assessment is requiredfollowing the initial injection through the inferior punctum.None of our patients needed cannulation of the superiorpunctum.</p><p>Routine bilateral DCG may be justified by the relativeease of the procedure; the lack of additional radiation, sincethe contralateral orbit is frequently included in the fieldof study; and the frequent finding of abnormalities in theclinically &#x02032;asymptomatic&#x02032; side.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Bilateral simultaneous injectionallows comparative study of flow characteristics through thenasolacrimal duct system. However, bilateral DCG for unilateralpathology may cause iatrogenic insult to the non-involvedtear duct system during cannulation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Bilateral studies wereperformed in 7 of 10 cases of instillation technique and 1 of 3cases of cannulation technique. We did not find any abnormalitieson imaging lacrimal drainage systems where symptoms ofepiphora or a medial canthal mass were not associated. We feelthat performance of bilateral CTDCG as a routine in patientswith unilateral symptoms must be avoided &#x02013; particularly ifcannulation, with its attendant risks, is needed.</p><p>Helical CT has several advantages over conventional CT. Thevolume data acquisition with thin (less than 1 mm) overlappingsections with helical CT allows superior quality of coronal,sagittal [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>] and 3D reconstruction, which obviates the needfor direct coronal scanning, thereby reducing the total radiationexposure and scanning time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Also, direct coronal scanningrequires neck hyperextension in prone position, and there maybe artifacts from dental fillings, which are avoided by coronalreformation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> The shorter acquisition time (less than 20 to 30sec) with helical CT allows the study to be done in childrenwithout sedation, ensures patient cooperation and avoids imagedegradation due to patient movement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Reconstruction of 3Dimages using a connectivity algorithm can be obtained, and thelacrimal system can be viewed in relationship to the adjacentorbital and facial skeleton [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>].<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p><p>We believe that CTDCG is useful in the assessment ofcomplex lacrimal problems such as in patients with medialcanthal tumors, mid-face trauma or following sinus or lacrimalsurgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Instillation technique is noninvasive, obviating theneed for cannulation of the lacrimal passage and its attendantrisks, thereby enhancing the safety and usefulness of thisinvestigative modality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CTDCG is a useful diagnostic tool in clinically challenging casesof lacrimal system abnormality. It defines the lacrimal systemanatomy accurately, facilitates preoperative planning andintraoperative decision-making. Instillation of nonionic, water-soluble contrast in the conjunctival cul de sac is a physiologic,simple and sensitive method to evaluate lacrimal obstruction.We propose it as a first step, catheterization being used only inthe absence of opacification after instillation. Helical CT withits volume data acquisition capability, shorter acquisition time,with high-resolution coronal, sagittal and 3D reconstructionoffers advantage over conventional CT scan.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Source of Support: Nil</p></fn><fn><p>Conflict of Interest: None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation
