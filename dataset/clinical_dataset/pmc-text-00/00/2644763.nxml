From this point of view, virulence biomolecules, in particular those secreted or ecto-localized at the parasite's plasma membrane seem to be good targets. The concentrations of extra cellular nucleotides and their derivative molecules, such as adenosine and inosine are linked to ecto-nucleotidase activities of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Matsuoka1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-DiVirgilio1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of ecto-nucleotidases as the major biomolecules involved in the control of purinergic signaling were demonstrated in various models, such as the dominant role of CD39 in the modulation of inflammation and immune response in the Langerhans cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Mizumoto1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and in cardioprotection and protective responses to hypoxia/ischemia in murine model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Kohler1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Eltzschig1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

Parasites (trypomastigotes) that completed this passage presented 2.5-fold higher levels of ecto-ATPase activities when compared with amastigote-like parasites that could not penetrate into VERO cells. These data reinforce that a high ecto-ATPase activity is important for infectivity and suggest that the absence of host factors leads to loss of infectivity factors from <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. Similar suggestion was made by B&#x000ea;rredo-Pinho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-BerredoPinho1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> when the ecto-ATPase activity was assayed on promastigotes from <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> and showed that higher passages in acellular medium lead to low ecto-ATPase levels and avirulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-BerredoPinho1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as we have used a single strain (Y) in our experiments, verification of correlation between infectivity and Ecto-ATPDase activity in other strains may provide further support to our hypothesis.</p><p>In order to evaluate the importance of Ecto-NTPDase activity in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infectivity we performed experiments with three known enzyme inhibitors. Analyzing Ecto-ATPDase inhibitory effects of these compounds we observed that all were able to partially inhibit both ecto-ATPase and -ADPase on live parasites, but the effect of ARL67156 and Gadolinium on the ecto-ATPase was lower than that observed for Suramin. In parallel, we observed that P1 trypomastigotes treated with ecto-nucleotidase inhibitors showed significant decrements of <italic>in vitro</italic> infectivity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0000387-t001">Table 1</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0000387-g006">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting the importance of Ecto-ATPDase activity in these processes. We cannot exclude the possibility that inhibitors used in this work had an additional action on other molecular targets. It has been shown that P2 receptors are susceptible to blockage by Suramin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-vonKugelgen1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, but even if that is the case our data would still point out the importance of the extracellular nucleotide metabolism for <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, as demonstrated for other parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-deAlmeidaMarquesdaSilva1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Further studies including the use of more selective ENTPDase inhibititors, such as Polyoxometalates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Muller1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and anthraquinone derivatives from bromaminic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Baqi1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, are still necessary to determine the exact molecular mechanism inducing the loss of infectivity and virulence observed in our experiments.</p><p>Parasites have been incubated with high concentrations of inhibitor, but the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments were performed in drug-free medium after the centrifugation of parasites. The persistence of effects from drugs on the parasite even after their removal suggests that the drugs might have triggered persistent changes in the parasite's metabolism that had a very slow recovery rate.</p><p>Considering the important roles of ATP, ADP and Adenosine as extracellular molecules in modulating the inflammatory process and platelet aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Mizumoto1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Hasko1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Daniel1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> and the proposed role of NTPDases in host pathogen interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Sansom3">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible to speculate that some of the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects observed might be correlated to the impairment of the parasites' ability to modulate the levels of these nucleotides by inhibition of NTPDase. Further experiments are warranted to substantiate this hypothesis.</p><p>The present work shows the first biochemical demonstration of recombinant <italic>T. cruzi</italic> Ecto-NTPDase-1 activity. Enzymatic inhibition of this recombinant protein in the presence of Suramin, suggests that the effects of this drug on intact parasites, namely blockage of cell infection may be due to targeting of this inhibitor to the Ecto-NTPDase-1 on their surface. Polyclonal antiserum to <italic>T.cruzi</italic> Ecto-NTPDase also blocked infection of the cells. It should be noted that the antibodies did not display any direct inhibitory effect on enzymatic activity of the recombinant NTPDase-1, under controlled <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. Considering that during the infection process the parasite will be exposed to diverse environmental conditions, it is possible that even though the antibody was not directly targeted to the NTPDase-1 active site, it might bind to modulatory regions preventing the response of the enzyme to certain stimuli. Alternatively, antibody binding might generate a steric hindrance at the parasite surface that prevents its adhesion to host cells.</p><p>Structural studies of NTPDase-1 and its use for the rational design of inhibitors could be a relevant strategy for the development of new drugs to treat the disease. In addition, the observed effect of antibodies on the parasites suggests that an effective immune response from the host could be mounted based on vaccination using this antigen. Further immunization experiments using this protein are necessary to verify its potential as a protective antigen.</p><p>In contrast, the observed ARL 67156 and Gadolinium inhibition of hydrolytic activities on live parasites could be related with another ecto-nucleotidase target, since they caused no inhibition of purified <italic>T. cruzi</italic> Ecto-NTPDase-1; this observation suggests the existence of other enzymes with Ecto-NTPDase activity at the parasite surface. We exhaustively searched for another apyrase/CD39 gene in the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> genome public database, including the <italic>in silico</italic> screening of 67 Mb of partial genome assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-ElSayed1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> without any success. This indicates that targets for ARL 67156 and Gadolinium are either Ecto-NTPDases encoded by genes that are located in a portion of the genome not yet sequenced or are proteins with no detectable primary sequence similarity with Ecto-NTPDase. Alternatively, it is possible that Ecto-NTPDase-1 is in fact inhibited by these other compounds, but the recombinant version of this protein is insensitive due to alterations in its structure compared to the native form.</p><p>This paper shows the correlation of Ecto-ATPDase activity with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infectivity and virulence. In addition, inhibitors of such activity tested here appear to interfere with the parasite infection process and emerge as possible new clinical drugs to Chagas disease treatment. Because Suramin and Gadolinium are currently used in unrelated human chemotherapy these drugs have already been tried for safety and may provide prompt options for development and use in Chagas disease treatment. Suramin is a current drug used in the treatment of Human African trypanosomiasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Docampo1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> and exhibits toxic effects to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Bisaggio2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Bisaggio3">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Gadolinium is used as a contrast drug in magnetic resonance clinical imaging exams. (Gd)-based paramagnetic contrast agents are relatively safe when used in clinically recommended doses, however there is literature linking Gd-based paramagnetic contrast agents with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with renal failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0000387-Ersoy1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. We believe that chemotherapy studies with these compounds and their association with the currently used drug Benznidazole in lower doses is warranted and may represent an alternative to treat Chagas
