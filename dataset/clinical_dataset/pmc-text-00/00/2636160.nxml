Refractive error, as a causeof visual impairment was excluded. It was also estimated thatup to 75% of all blindness is avoidable. Glaucoma is the secondleading cause of blindness globally as well as in most regionsaccording to the WHO survey 2002. It accounts for 12.3% ofglobal blindness (Vision &#x0003c;20/200 in better eye).</p><p>Most primary glaucomas are managed by early diagnosisand treatment and secondary glaucomas differ fromprimary by the fact that, if the primary pathology is treatedproperly and the possibility of secondary glaucoma is keptin mind, glaucomatous damage can be easily prevented.Ophthalmologists need to be careful in this regard whiletreating primary pathologies which have high chance ofdeveloping glaucoma secondarily.</p><p>This chart review was undertaken to find the commoncauses, demographics and clinical characteristics of varioussecondary glaucomas.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In this retrospective chart review, 2997 patients referred withglaucoma to our tertiary glaucoma center in the year 2005 wereevaluated by glaucoma specialists. The evaluation includeda detailed history and detailed examination performedincluding vision, anterior segment examination, intraocularpressure (IOP) by Goldman applanation tonometry, andgonioscopy. Stereoscopic fundus evaluation was performedwherever possible. Visual fields were available in only a fewpatients as the rest had very poor visual acuity, so they couldnot be evaluated.</p><p>Secondary glaucoma was diagnosed when the followingcriteria were met: a positive history and ocular findings ofpathologies such as trauma, previous surgery, neovascularization,inflammation, or any other abnormal ocular or systemic findingsthat could have caused prior or current IOP elevation. Patientswith unilateral glaucoma were included as secondary glaucomaonly if the other eye had no evidence or family history of aprimary glaucoma. The other eye had IOP, gonioscopy andfundus evaluation and if required diurnal variation and visualfield to exclude primary glaucoma.</p><p>Secondary glaucoma was diagnosed in the presence ofchronically raised IOP with or without glaucomatous opticneuropathy. The main outcome measures were demographicdata, the etiology of secondary glaucoma, visual acuity, IOP,manipulation or indentation gonioscopy, glaucomatous opticneuropathy and any other positive findings.</p><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS 10 statistical software (PCversion, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Two thousand nine hundred and ninety seven patients werereferred to the glaucoma service in 2005 of which 347 werediagnosed to have no glaucoma by our specialists. Of the 2650patients diagnosed as glaucoma or glaucoma suspects, 579patients (21.84%) had secondary glaucoma.</p><p>In patients having secondary glaucoma, male female ratiowas 2.2 and the age distribution was as follows: 25% werebetween 0-20 years; 27% were between 21-40 years; 30%were between 41-60 years and 18% were &#x0003e;60 years. Commoncauses of secondary glaucoma were post vitrectomy surgery(14%), trauma (13%), corneal pathology (12%), aphakia(11%), neovascular glaucoma (10%), pseudophakia (10%),steroid-induced glaucoma (8%), uveitic glaucoma (8%), andmiscellaneous causes (14%). Miscellaneous causes includedlens-induced glaucoma, post penetrating keratoplastyglaucoma, glaucoma secondary to tumor, pseudoexfoliationsyndrome, pigment dispersion glaucoma, glaucoma secondaryto retinopathy of prematurity, aniridia, iridocorneal endothelialsyndrome and chemical injury. The etiology of secondaryglaucoma in the year 2005 was compared to the available pastdata of 10 years from 1970-80 from the same center [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>The distribution of glaucoma in different age groups isshown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. Young patients below 20 years of age hadtrauma as the most common cause of secondary glaucoma,whereas those between 21-40 years of age had glaucomafollowing vitreoretinal surgery with or without vitreoussubstitute as the leading cause. Between 41-60 years of age,neovascular glaucoma followed by glaucoma secondary tocorneal pathology was common. In the older population above60 years of age, pseudophakic glaucoma was the commonestcause, followed by aphakic and neovascular glaucoma. Thesex distribution of various glaucomas is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, withmale preponderance in all, except uveitic glaucoma.</p><p>We performed further analysis to look for distribution ofsecondary juvenile glaucomas (below 35 years) and comparedwith 164 cases in 1984 and 100 cases of juvenile secondaryglaucoma in 1988 presented to the same center.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Secondaryjuvenile glaucomas constituted 50% of secondary glaucomasof all ages (277 cases). Common causes of secondary glaucomawere trauma 28%, post-vitrectomy 15%, corneal pathology 12%,steroid-induced 10% [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].</p><p>We further analyzed each type of glaucoma for their clinicalcharacteristics and risk factors, summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>.</p><p>Glaucoma following vitreoretinal surgery accounted for14% of secondary glaucomas. It was the most common etiologyin the 21-60 years age group. Males were more frequentlyaffected (M:F ratio = 4:1). A vitreous substitute was used in83% cases, of which 73% cases had silicone oil. Sixty-six percent eyes had retained silicone oil (1,000 centistokes viscosity)for &#x0003e;three months. Other associated risk factors found weretrauma in 23%, myopia in 9% and others such as diabetes,vascular occlusion, and steroid use. A vision of &#x02264;20/200 waspresent in 63% eyes and 57% eyes had an IOP &#x02265;30 mm Hg aftervitrectomy. Glaucomatous optic neuropathy (CD ratio &#x02265; 0.7)was found in 65% cases and 42% cases had CD ratio &#x02265; 0.9.</p><p>Traumatic glaucoma was the second most common causeof secondary glaucoma in all age groups and the leading causein 0-20 years age group. Of all traumatic glaucoma patients,71% were below 30 years of age, and male 90%. Blunt traumawas the mode of injury in 85% of cases, play-related - cricketball, tennis ball, gilli-danda, hockey stick, bamboo stick andstone in 30% cases; fire cracker injury in 20% cases and 50%were work-related, assaults or accidental injury. Gonioscopycould be performed in 78% of eyes, with 66% eyes showingangle recession. In eyes having angle recession, two or morequadrants were involved in 87% cases. Other features oftrauma like sphincter tear, hyphema, iridodialysis, subluxation,dislocation, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, andcataract could be seen in various combinations in about 95%cases. Fifty per cent of traumatic glaucomas had an IOP of&#x02265;30 mm Hg and 56% had a vision &#x02264;20/200. Optic nerve headcould be assessed in 50% of eyes, of which 50% showedglaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON). Protective glasseswere not worn by the individuals at the time of vulnerableplay activities.</p><p>Glaucoma secondary to corneal pathologies was also frequent.Fifty per cent of these cases were less than 40 years of age.Bilateral opacities were present in one-fifth of the cases. The mostcommon etiology was a healed corneal ulcer (50%); 10% were posttraumatic. All eyes had a vision of &#x0003c;20/200, and fundus evaluationwas not possible due to the presence of the opacity.</p><p>Aphakic glaucoma affected the two extremes of age.Twenty-five per cent of cases were under 15 years of age, 85%were after congenital cataract and 15% were post traumatic.</p><p>Fifty-eight per cent cases were over 50 years of age after cataractextraction. Forty per cent cases of aphakic glaucomas werebilateral. Forty-five per cent of aphakic glaucomas had an IOPof &#x02265;30 mm Hg and 37% had a vision of &#x02264;20/200. Glaucomatousoptic neuropathy (CD ratio &#x02265;0.7) was found in 58% cases and26% of cases had CD ratio &#x02265; 0.9.</p><p>Neovascular glaucoma constituted 9% cases of all secondaryglaucomas. Common causes of neovascular glaucoma werecentral retinal vein occlusion (22%), proliferative diabeticretinopathy (22%) and vasculitis (22%). Ninety-five per centeyes had vision &#x0003c;20/200. An IOP &#x0003e; 30 mm was present in 78%cases. Optic nerve head could be assessed in 38% eyes of which75% showed GON (CD ratio &#x02265; 0.7) and 50% of cases had CDratio &#x02265; 0.9. In this group we saw some of the end stage chronicprimary angle closure glaucoma cases (10%) presenting withneovascular glaucoma.</p><p>Steroid-induced glaucoma was present in 8% of all cases.Of all cases of steroid-induced cases, 50% were avoidableand were due to the use of treatment for ocular allergiesor postoperatively or drops used over the counter withoutprescription. The rest were due to treatment for systemicconditions such as sarcoidosis, scleroderma, primarysclerosing cholangitis, polymyositis, ulcerative colitis,nephritic syndrome and uveitis. These could also have beenavoidable if the concerned physicians treating them forthese systemic diseases were educated on the possibility ofsteroid-induced IOP elevation and glaucoma and had eitherwarned the patients or had referred them to ophthalmologistsfor interventions. Bilateral involvement was seen in 68% ofcases. A vision of &#x02264;20/200 was present in 20% eyes, 50% eyeshad an IOP &#x02265; 30 mm Hg. Glaucomatous optic neuropathy(CD ratio &#x02265; 0.7) was found in 50% cases.</p><p>Uveitic glaucoma followed attacks of anterior uveitis in90% cases, and the rest were seen in panuveitis. Bilateralinvolvement was seen in 50% of cases. Vision of &#x02264;20/200 waspresent in 70% eyes, 60% eyes had an IOP &#x02265; 30 mm Hg reachingup to 59 mm of Hg. Optic nerve head could be assessed in 45%eyes of which 40% showed GON.</p><p>Pseudophakic glaucoma affected the older population, 80%of patients being above 40 years of age. Most cases were unilateral(93%). A large number of eyes (37%) had either anterior chamberintraocular lens (IOL) or a posterior chamber IOL placed in theanterior chamber or a pupillary capture of IOL. Ninety per centcases had undergone a complicated cataract surgery. Sixty percent of pseudophakic glaucomas had an IOP of &#x02265;30 mm Hg and50% had vision &#x02264;20/200. Optic nerve could be evaluated in 50%cases of which 50% showed GON (CD ratio &#x02265; 0.7).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this institution-based retrospective chart review, secondaryglaucomas were seen in 22.07% of all newly diagnosedglaucomas. We have ascertained a demographic and clinicalprofile of all secondary glaucomas over a year. It is one of thelargest series of secondary glaucoma studied.</p><p>Secondary glaucoma results from numerous ocular orsystemic disorders and shows a poor IOP control with ocularhypotensive agents or filtering surgery in its late stages. Thus,early detection is important to maximize the chance of atherapeutic response. The causative lesion overshadows anysymptoms or signs of the secondary glaucoma, so that thediagnosis is often missed and almost invariably delayed. This,we feel, is largely due to the lack of knowledge regarding therelative frequency of the various causes of secondary glaucoma.Since it is secondary to other ocular or systemic pathology,primary prevention is possible by keeping in mind risk factorsassociated with the development of glaucoma.</p><p>Despite its public health significance, there is limited dataavailable on the prevalence of secondary glaucoma and thepossible risk factors for secondary glaucoma. The population-based Aravind comprehensive eye survey from south India<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>reported a 0.7% incidence of secondary glaucomas wherethe total prevalence of glaucoma was 2.6%, i.e. a third of allglaucoma cases. The total number of cases in this study wasvery small for any further analysis. In another population-based study in the Japanese population,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> secondary glaucomaand primary angle closure glaucoma had an almost equalincidence of 0.6% and 0.5% respectively among a totalincidence of glaucoma of 5%. This amounts to 10% of all casesof glaucoma.</p><p>A similar study in the past from the same center has reportedsecondary glaucoma cases of 10 years (1970-80) from theretrospective review chart.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Study from north India reports a6.72% diagnosis of secondary glaucoma out of all glaucomareferrals in a five-year hospital-based retrospective analysis(1995- 99).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Other studies from Finland<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> andPakistan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> foundan incidence of 33% and 35% respectively.</p><p>Secondary glaucomas had very poor vision of &#x0003c;20/200 atpresentation in almost all types except steroid-induced andaphakic glaucomas. An IOP of &#x02265;30 was present in &#x02265;50% cases inalmost all types except the aphakic group. Glaucomatous opticneuropathy (cup disc ratio &#x02265; 0.7) was found in &#x02265;50% of the caseswhere fundus could be visualized. Such figures should alert theophthalmologists treating the primary pathology regarding theneed for early initiation of anti-glaucoma medications.</p><p>There has been an increase in the total number of cases ofsecondary glaucoma referred to our center over time. Totalnumber of cases were 1065 in the decade from 1970-1980,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>while in one year (year 2005) the number was 585. In thiswork, post-vitrectomy glaucoma was the most common causeamong the secondary glaucomas in the year 2005. Thirty yearsearlier the commonest cause was aphakic glaucoma, which hasdramatically reduced with advancements in cataract surgery.Aphakic glaucoma and glaucoma secondary to senile cataractaccounted for nearly 50% of all causes of secondary glaucoma.Lens-induced glaucoma has also shown a decline due togreater awareness in the population about cataract extractionand better surgical facilities. Traumatic and post-vitrectomyglaucoma have shown a dramatic increase in number in thecurrent study. Traumatic glaucoma has increased in incidencefrom 8.4% to 13%. Other causes maintain an almost similarprevalence as in the past.</p><p>In the age group of below 20 years, trauma remains the mostcommon cause, as was seen earlier in a study of secondaryjuvenile glaucomas.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> This study shows the emergence of post-vitrectomy glaucoma with or without vitreous substitute as thesecond most frequent cause of juvenile secondary glaucoma.Juvenile aphakic glaucoma has increased in incidence from4% to 8.3% this time.</p><p>As the most common causes were post-vitrectomy andtrauma which were more common in males, they accounted for ahigher incidence of secondary glaucoma in males. Also, in India,men are more likely to reach a tertiary center than women.</p><p>In post-vitrectomy glaucoma, silicone oil seemed to be avery important factor, especially when retained for more thanthree months. Honavar <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> in their study on glaucoma aftervitrectomy in Indian patients has shown silicone-inducedglaucoma in 70% cases of all glaucoma. Other causes werepreexisting glaucoma, neovascular glaucoma and traumaticglaucoma (5%) in their series. In our cases too silicone oil wasused in a majority of cases and other factors were trauma,myopia, diabetes. Silicone oil-filled eyes need to have frequentIOP measurements, and oil should be removed as soon as thetamponade effect is no longer required.</p><p>Traumatic glaucoma was associated with angle recessionand other features of trauma in 95% cases. Ellong <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> havereported a incidence of 4.2% compared to 2.9% in our study, oftraumatic glaucoma out of all glaucoma cases. In their studytoo, monocular blindness was seen in 61.9%, mean IOP was36.9 &#x000b1; 13.8 mm Hg and mean recorded C:D ratio was 0.8 &#x000b1; 0.2.Irido-corneal angle recession was seen in 61.9%. Damage tothe iris or lens, vitreous hemorrhage, and inflammation onbaseline examination has been shown to be associated witha significantly greater risk of developing glaucoma afterpenetrating ocular involvement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Penetratinginjuries were followed by a secondary glaucoma if an adherent leucoma and/or evidence of lenticular damage or displacement were seen.</p><p>In corneal pathologies secondary to infective etiologythere may be inflammation and a higher incidence of rise ofIOP. However, accurate measurement of IOP is difficult, andpneumotonometry if available, may be of value in these cases.Glaucoma secondary to an improperly managed or non-responsive bacterial or fungal ulcer with subsequent formationof adherent leucoma was common.</p><p>It is important to mention that steroid-induced responsedepends on the duration of therapy, type of steroids used,as well as genetic influence of a person. Most of the casesincluded in this study had GON due to long-term use ofsystemic and/or local steroids, indicating their late presentationto this hospital. In this respect, general physicians should beeducated regarding the side-effects of systemic steroids andthe importance of regular follow-up starting from initiationof steroid therapy with an ophthalmologist. Over the counterissue of topical corticosterids should be strongly discouragedin this regard.</p><p>This analysis of secondary glaucomas helps identify thefive common primary pathologies as trauma, post vitrectomy,adherent leukomas, pseudophakia and aphakia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Source of Support: Nil</p></fn><fn><p>Conflict of Interest: None
