Within rod cells, photo-isomerization converts 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal of rhodopsin to all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal, which is then reduced to all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinol by NADPH. All-<italic>trans</italic>-retinol diffuses across the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) and enters the RPE cells. Within RPE cells, all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinol is esterified with a fatty acid and the resultant all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinyl ester is isomerized to 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinol with hydrolysis of the ester bond. 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinol is subsequently oxidized by NAD(P) to 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal, which leaves the RPE apical surface, diffuses to photoreceptor cell outer segments, and binds to opsin to regenerate rhodopsin. Several reviews have described the chemistry and enzymology of the visual cycle in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>Esterification of all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinol in RPE is due primarily to lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), with minor contributions from acylCoA:retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Isomerization and simultaneous hydrolysis of all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinyl ester to 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinol can be attributed to the activity of RPE65 (isomerohydrolase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. RDH5 plays a major role in the oxidation of 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinol to 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal based on the delayed dark adaptation displayed by humans with mutations in the gene for this enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. In <italic>Rdh5</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the rate of rhodopsin regeneration is normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]; however, 13-<italic>cis</italic>-retinoids accumulate, indicating that visual cycle metabolites are not metabolized normally.</p><p><italic>Rdh11<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> is another candidate for this activity in mice, but some results suggest it plays a minor role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. The dehydrogenase(s) responsible for reduction of all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal in rod photoreceptor cells of mice has not been identified. Targeted disruption of individual candidate genes failed to have a major effect on rhodopsin regeneration rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinyl ester hydrolase (REH) activity has been detected in RPE extracts but not yet assigned to a molecular entity.</p><p>Three water-soluble retinoid-binding proteins have been demonstrated to play roles in the rod visual cycle. CRALBP binds <italic>cis</italic>-retinoids with high affinity. Delays in dark adaptation resulted from mutations of its gene in humans (<italic>RLBP1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] and from disruption of its gene (<italic>Rlbp1</italic>) in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Analysis of visual cycle retinoids in <italic>Rlbp1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice retinas localized the impairment in the visual cycle to the isomerase reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>], which reinforced the proposed role for CRALBP as an acceptor for 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinol from the isomerohydrolase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic>CRBP1</italic> gene have not been associated with retinal diseases. Mice deficient in this protein have reduced amounts of hepatic and RPE retinyl esters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], consistent with the role proposed for this protein from in vitro studies as a carrier of all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinol for enzymatic esterification by LRAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) is present in the interphotoreceptor matrix, where it can solubilize and protect retinoids. No mutations have been reported in the <italic>IRBP</italic> gene in humans. <italic>Irbp</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have been shown to display slow photoreceptor degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. However, the rate of rhodopsin regeneration was normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the known enzymes and retinoid-binding proteins of RPE, two scaffold proteins are associated with the visual cycle because of their interactions with CRALBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. EBP50/NHERF1 is a scaffold protein with two Post-synaptic density 95/Discs Large/Zonula Occludens 1 (PDZ) domains and a C-terminal domain that binds ezrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. At least one of these PDZ domains binds CRALBP via a conserved C-terminal PDZ-motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. Ezrin is an indirect interaction partner of CRALBP by virtue of its affinity for a C-terminal domain of EBP50/NHERF1. Ezrin, in turn, can bind to F-actin via a C-terminal domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>].</p><p>The RPE consists of a single layer of hexagonal cells that exhibit a striking polarization of plasma membrane components. As in other epithelial cells, regional specializations of cellular structure reflect the different roles of the apical, lateral, and basal surfaces of the cells. Basal RPE surfaces are characterized by pronounced infoldings, which abut the basement membrane separating the cells from the choroidal blood supply. Presumably this specialization reflects the need to maximize surface area for uptake of nutrients from and delivery of wastes to choroidal blood. Proteins of tight junctions, such as occludin and claudin, characterize the lateral surfaces of RPE cells. Apical surfaces of RPE cells elaborate long processes (approximately 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m), which extend to envelope outer segments of adjacent photoreceptor cells. This intimate association of RPE apical processes and photoreceptor outer segments has long been associated with nutritional exchange between these two cell types, including retinoid exchange during regeneration of visual pigment as described in the previous section. Regions of the apical surface are also involved in phagocytosis of shed portions of distal outer segments in the process of outer segment membrane renewal. Many proteins show a restricted distribution to one or another of these plasma membrane surfaces or regions of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>].</p><p>Several enzymes of the rod visual cycle have been localized to RPE cells, but their regional distributions within these cells have not been examined in the context of rod visual cycle function. In addition, pigmented animals or older animals with lipofuscin accumulations were used for many of the localizations. The presence of pigment granules within the somata can mask or diminish fluorescence in this area, whereas the bright yellow fluorescence of lipofuscin can obscure weaker fluorescent signals. Here, we demonstrate that three enzymes of the visual cycle (LRAT, RPE65, and RDH5) are confined to somata of rodent RPE cells and restricted from the apical processes. This localization, when taken with the known pan-retinal localization of the retinoid-binding proteins and the predominantly apical localization of associated proteins, is likely to be important is generating the directed flows of retinoids characteristic of the visual cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>This study used 2-month-old female albino BALB/c mice and 10-week-old female albino Sprague Dawley rats.

Fluorescence intensity with anti-LRAT was above background over the nucleus in the image shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2I</xref>); however, this labeling was not always seen. A similar labeling pattern (soma but not apical processes) was observed with albino rat retina with anti-RPE65 and anti-RDH5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E,F</xref>, respectively). Soma, but not apical processes, were also labeled with bovine retina using a monoclonal anti-RPE65 (mAb 9&#x02013;22) and with a polyclonal anti-RDH5 (results not shown). mAb 9&#x02013;22 did not recognize rodent RPE65.

The different distributions reported in this study led to a model for visual cycle function. all-<italic>trans</italic>-Retinol, released from rod photoreceptor cells during illumination, is taken up via the apical surface of RPE cells. In turn, 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal is released from the apical surface for regeneration of rhodopsin. Visual cycle enzymes convert all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinol to 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal within the cell body. The presence of CRALBP and CRBP in both the cell body and apical processes allows these retinoid-binding proteins to facilitate diffusion of 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal and all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinol from sites of release and uptake, respectively, in the apical processes to and from enzymatic processing in the cell body. Within the apical processes, NHERF1, ezrin, and actin interact with CRALBP. Release of 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal occurs by an unknown mechanism but may be related to complex formation of interaction of CRALBP, ezrin, and EBP50/NHERF1 in the apical processes. Release and uptake of retinoids occurs along the whole apical membrane. It is depicted only from the apical processes for clarity. CRALBP and CRBP facilitate diffusion by providing binding sites for retinoids, whose diffusions are driven in either scleral or vitreal directions by concentration gradients generated by esterification of retinol by LRAT and perhaps affinity of opsin for 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mv-v15-223-f6"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we determined the localization of three enzymes of the rod visual cycle in albino rodent RPE and compared these to the known localization of other components of the rod visual cycle. The striking finding that emerged is that localizations fell into three distinct patterns: somata only, apical processes only (or mainly), and pan-RPE. Restriction of the enzymatic reactions to the somata could provide concentration gradients to drive diffusion of the all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinol toward the somata and 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal toward the apical processes. The pan-RPE localizations of CRALBP and CRBP1 reinforce their proposed roles in mediating diffusion of retinoids between the apical membranes, where release and uptake of retinoids must occur, and the somata where the visual cycle reactions take place. Finally, components largely confined to the RPE apical processes are well placed to mediate release of 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal from CRALBP and ultimately from RPE.</p><sec><title>Actin</title><p>Numerous investigators have localized f-actin to RPE apical processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>] and other regions of the RPE cell. Fluorescence was particularly intense over both RPE and M&#x000fc;ller cell apical processes and along the basal border of RPE cells. The presence of actin in these processes provides a rationale for localization of ezrin, an actin-binding protein. Others have noted ezrin localization near the basal side of RPE cells.</p></sec><sec><title>CRALBP</title><p>A pan-RPE distribution of CRALBP was suggested in the first published immunocytochemical studies with bovine and primate retinas in which somata were heavily labeled by anti-CRALBP and apical processes appeared as a fluorescent fringe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed a uniform distribution of CRALBP in the cytoplasm of squirrel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>] and bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>] RPE cells. Subsequent studies of retinas with conventional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] and laser scanning confocal microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>] confirmed this pan-RPE localization. The only exception to this observation is the rat retina shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> where the somata appeared less heavily labeled than the apical processes. CRALBP was also noted to outline the profile of M&#x000fc;ller cells, including their apical processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>CRBP1</title><p>CRBP1 was localized to RPE and M&#x000fc;ller cells of rat and bovine retinas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>], and its presence in RPE apical processes was noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. The pan-RPE distribution was particularly evident in the images we obtained with confocal microscopy. CRBPI was also observed in M&#x000fc;ller cells of rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. In our studies, M&#x000fc;ller cells were less heavily labeled with anti-CRBP1 than RPE cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Ezrin</title><p>Ezrin displayed a striking localization to apical processes of RPE, as noted in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>]. Labeling of apical processes of M&#x000fc;ller cells was much lighter and not always apparent unless the fluorescence intensity of RPE cells was allowed to saturate. The apical localization of ezrin likely has its origin in the affinity of ezrin for filamentous actin, which is found within the RPE apical processes. Ezrin has an actin-binding domain at its C-terminus. A compound FERM (Band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, and moesin) domain at its N-terminus has an affinity for EBP50/NHERF1, a scaffold protein with two PDZ domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>EBP50/NHERF1</title><p>EBP50/NHERF1 was clearly evident within the apical processes of rat and mouse RPE cells and also evident within the somata, where it had been noted previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>]. In rat RPE cells, EBP50/NHERF1 appeared in a band near the basal surface. The punctate character of EBP50/NHERF1 staining in M&#x000fc;ller and RPE apical processes was particularly striking and was present regardless of efforts to minimize nonspecific aggregation. A punctate distribution of moesin, a related protein, was noted in retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>]. Recent studies demonstrated that CRALBP has a PDZ motif at its C-terminal sequence (N/DTAL/F) and in vitro binds to at least one of the PDZ-domains of EBP50/NHERF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. As we have mentioned, it also has affinity for ezrin. It is possible that the punctate foci represent complexes of ezrin, EBP50/NHERF1, CRALBP, and perhaps actin. However, we have no evidence to support this contention at present.</p></sec><sec><title>LRAT</title><p>LRAT was localized to RPE cells in previous studies, but it was unclear from published images if the protein was expressed in RPE apical processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. Our results with albino mouse retina indicate that the enzyme is expressed in the cell bodies of RPE cells but not in the long apical processes. Expression was not observed in inner retina in our studies.</p></sec><sec><title>RPE65</title><p>RPE65 was originally identified as p63, a putative membrane receptor for retinol-binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. Immunocytochemistry with anti-p63 and bovine retina revealed relatively exclusive labeling in the RPE layer of bovine retina with apparent labeling of apical processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>]. However, subsequent immunocytochemical localization with confocal microscopy and the same antibody did not show evidence of labeled apical processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that the enzyme is in the somata and not in the long apical processes.</p></sec><sec><title>11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase</title><p>Anti-RDH5 labeled RPE somata heavily. Long apical processes were not labeled. RDH4, the mouse ortholog of RDH5, was previously localized to the RPE layer of mouse in the initial report of its expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>]. RDH11, another dehydrogenase with <italic>cis</italic>-retinol dehydrogenase activity, was previously localized to the RPE layer of monkey and bovine retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. Apical processes do not appear to be labeled in these studies; however, fine anatomic localization was not the primary aim of either study.</p></sec><sec><title>Endoplasmic reticulum</title><p>The known enzymes of the rod visual cycle are membrane-associated as noted in studies of the isomerohydrolase (RPE65) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r59">59</xref>], LRAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>], and <italic>cis</italic>-RDH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>]. Membranes bearing these enzymes have not been extensively characterized; however, it is likely that they are derived from the ER. The restriction of these enzymes to RPE somata suggests that the ER doesn&#x02019;t extend into the apical processes. Restriction of calreticulin to RPE somata is consistent with this suggestion. Calreticulin is an ER-resident lectin involved in the quality control of nascent glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. However, tubular structures are evident in the apical processes in some [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r64">64</xref>] but not all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r65">65</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r67">67</xref>] high-resolution electron microscopic studies. The mechanism for restriction of enzymes of the visual cycle to RPE somata awaits more extensive studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Light and dark effects</title><p>The exposure to light for 60 min did not affect the distribution LRAT, RPE65, or RDH5, relative to the dark-adapted retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>), nor were there major changes in the distributions of CRALBP and CRBP1 (results not shown). Determining whether there was a quantitative change in the punctate character of EBP50/NHERF1 label will require a more extensive study.</p></sec><sec><title>Model</title><p>The distribution of visual cycle components documented in this study led to a model for compartmentalization of reactions and processes of the visual cycle within RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). During active cycling of visual pigment, the anatomy of the outer retina dictates that both release of 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal and uptake of all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinol must occur via the RPE apical plasma membrane. Based on our localization of LRAT, RPE65, and RDH5, transformation of all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinol into 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal must occur with the somata of the RPE cells. The two retinoid-binding proteins CRALBP and CRBP1, which are found throughout the RPE cells, overlap these two locations, allowing the binding proteins to facilitate transport of retinoids between the cell bodies and apical membranes.</p><p>We do not suggest that CRALBP and CRBP1 undergo massive displacements within the RPE cell with their retinoid cargos. It is more likely that the proteins provide binding sites for the retinoids, which then diffuse through the aqueous phase via multiple cycles of binding and dissociation. A concentration gradient to drive sclerad diffusion of all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinol would be generated by the powerful LRAT activity in the cell body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], which would immediately esterify the vitamin and reduce its concentration. Similarly, multiple cycles of binding and dissociation of 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal and CRALBP would facilitate the diffusion of this retinoid from the site of its production in the cell body to sites of its release in apical membranes. The driving force for vitreal diffusion of 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal is unknown but could be its release from CRALBP as well as from the RPE cell, and ultimately conjugation with opsin.</p><p>There is ample published evidence that CRALBP can be loaded with 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal by enzymes of the visual cycle. Apo-CRALBP stimulated the rate of 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinol formation by isomerohydrolase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>] and is routinely added to in vitro assays of this enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. RPE microsomes catalyzed the oxidation of 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinol bound to CRALBP by NAD(P) and the product of the reaction, 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal, was found associated with the binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r69">69</xref>]. Analysis of visual cycle retinoids in <italic>Rlbp1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice demonstrated that the flow of retinoids was impaired at the isomerization reaction, consistent with the proposed role of CRALBP as an acceptor of 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].

However, 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal is tightly bound to CRALBP (K<sub>d</sub> approximately 15 nM) and its functional group is sequestered from water-soluble carbonyl reagents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r69">69</xref>]. To date, no high-affinity acceptor for 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal has been found. The presence of CRALBP, ezrin, and EBP50/NHERF1 in RPE apical processes suggests that they could interact to form a multiprotein complex, which might be transient given the potential for regulation of ezrin reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Complexes of CRALBP and EBP50/NHERF1 have been demonstrated in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. The functional significance of these multiprotein complexes is unknown at present. However, they could increase the residence time of CRALBP in the vicinity of the apical plasma membrane where it could come in contact with acidic glycerophospholipids of the cytoplasmic leaflet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r70">70</xref>].
