We showed that the imbalance of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) uncoupling contributed to renal dysfunction in the diabetic nephropathy. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of ARB on uncoupled eNOS in rat diabetic nephropathy.</p><p><bold>Methods</bold>. Diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats with streptozotocin (65 mg/ kg body weight). After 6 weeks, rats were divided into saline (DM; <italic>n</italic> = 11) and ARB, losartan groups (DM+Los; <italic>n</italic> = 11). After 2-week treatment, glomerular ROS production was assessed by 2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA)-derived chemiluminescence. Renal NO and ROS production were imaged by confocal laser microscopy after renal perfusion with DCFH-DA and diaminorhodamine-4M acetoxymethyl ester with <sc>l</sc>-arginine. The dimeric form of eNOS was measured by low-temperature sodium dodecyl sulfate&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Serum tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Protein and mRNA expression of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GTPCH1), key enzyme of BH4 synthesis, were examined.</p><p><bold>Results</bold> Losartan attenuated glomerular ROS production in DM.

Because superoxide rapidly scavenges NO within the endothelium, a reduction in bioactive NO might occur despite the increase in NO generation. Among many enzymatic systems that are capable of producing superoxide, the NAD(P)H oxidase and the uncoupled endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) are the main sources of superoxide in vascular wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>] in diabetic patients. We also reported that in rat diabetic kidney, NAD(P)H oxidase and uncoupled eNOS were major sources of glomerular superoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Accordingly, these mechanisms are potential key targets for therapeutic interventions in endothelial dysfunction.</p><p>It was demonstrated that administration of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers (ARBs) slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>] and the development of proteinuria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] in patients with type 2 diabetes. This effect is specific and independent of their blood pressure lowering effect. Inhibition of the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor in diabetic patients reverses endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, long-term treatment with the ARB normalizes the structure of subcutaneous small arteries of hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Thus, the control of Ang II signalling by ARB could be potentially effective in improving endothelial function in diabetes. However, it is not clear whether ARB could improve eNOS uncoupling in hyperglycaemia-induced diabetic nephropathy. Accordingly, it was decided to examine whether short-term blockade of the AT1 receptor using losartan would have favourable effects on uncoupled eNOS in the diabetic glomeruli of rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes by lowering oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Experimental protocol and tissue preparation</title><p>The experimental protocol (No. 06-029) was approved in advance by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of the Kawasaki Medical School (Kurashiki, Japan). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (6&#x02013;7 weeks old) weighing 190 to 220 g were purchased from Charles River Japan Inc. (Kanagawa, Japan). Diabetes was induced by a single tail vein injection of STZ (65 mg/kg body weight; Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan) diluted in a citrate buffer, pH 4.5 [diabetes mellitus (DM); <italic>n</italic> = 22]. Age-matched non-diabetic control rats (Cont; <italic>n</italic> = 22) were each injected with an equal volume of citrate buffer. Six weeks after induction of DM, 11 rats from each group were provided over a period of 2 weeks with drinking water containing losartan (Banyu Pharmaceutical, Japan; 30 mg/kg/day, Cont+Los and DM+Los group). During the experimental period, body weight and blood glucose were measured weekly in each rat. At 8 weeks after induction of DM, the mean blood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method, and 24-h urine samples were obtained by using metabolic cages. Albumin concentrations in 24-h urine samples were measured by an ELISA kit (Exocell, Philadelphia, PA, USA). Eight weeks after induction of DM, the rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight) and serum was isolated and assayed for creatinine. From six rats in each group, the cortical tissue of the left kidney was cut into small pieces and the glomeruli were isolated by the mechanical graded sieving technique. The suspension of the glomeruli was then used for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production assay and protein isolation. The right kidney was used for immunohistochemistry. Five rats in each group were used for the <italic>in situ</italic> detection of NO and ROS.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Fluorescence spectrometric assay for production of ROS in isolated glomeruli</title><p>Production of peroxides, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and peroxynitrite, was measured in isolated glomeruli using the 2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorodihydrofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) method, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].

Our data demonstrated that blockade of Ang II signalling in diabetic glomeruli reduced ROS production and improved the eNOS coupling statement, and indeed restored NO bioavailability in glomeruli.</p><p>In the present study, we used an STZ-induced type 1 diabetes model to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of losartan on glomerular eNOS uncoupling in early diabetic nephropathy. But some of the characteristic early alterations in human diabetic nephropathy such as increased albuminuria, the development of glomerular hyperfiltration and some of the characteristic histopathological changes can be observed in the STZ-induced diabetic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Moreover, studies in the STZ-induced diabetic rat model have shown increased renal oxidative stress induced by hyperglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11">10,11</xref>]. So we have used this model for the study of glomerular endothelial dysfunction induced by hyperglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. In the present study, we also used this STZ model for the investigation of hyperglycaemia-induced eNOS uncoupling and the effects of losartan.</p><p>It has been reported that ARB have anti-oxidative effects in human essential hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], hypertensive diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and mouse type 2 diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Data of the present study also indicated that ARB treatment suppressed ROS production in diabetic glomeruli. It is known that Ang II mediates ROS generation through activation of NAD(P)H oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. As we reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], activation of NAD(P)H oxidase is also involved in ROS production in the diabetic glomeruli. We confirmed by direct observation that ARB reduced ROS production through the reduction of NAD(P)H oxidase activity. These finding are consistent with the previous reports that ARB attenuated NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent ROS production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p>In addition, using two different methods, we confirmed uncoupled eNOS in diabetic glomeruli. ARB improved the eNOS coupling state in diabetic glomeruli and recovered NO production to normal levels. The uncoupled NOS in diabetic glomeruli was confirmed by the decrease of eNOS dimer form and by <italic>in situ</italic> NO imaging. The <italic>in situ</italic> NO imaging method is useful for detecting NOS dysfunction. We used a kidney perfusate containing <sc>l</sc>-arginine and Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enhance NO production. Under normal conditions, coupled NOS converts <sc>l</sc>-arginine into <sc>l</sc>-citrulline and produces NO. However, when NOS cofactor BH4 is at suboptimal concentrations, <sc>l</sc>-arginine produces superoxide rather than NO through uncoupled NOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. This ROS production could be detected by the ROS fluorescent indicator, DCFH, in our <italic>in situ</italic> imaging method. Administration of ARB improved NOS function, as determined by increased glomerular NO production and decreased glomerular ROS production. These results also suggest that ARB can improve uncoupled NOS in the diabetic glomeruli.</p><p>BH4 serves as a critical co-factor for eNOS and deficiency of BH4 results in eNOS uncoupling, which is associated with increased superoxide and decreased NO production. We found that serum levels of BH4 in the diabetic rats were lower than those in control rats, and ARB restored BH4 bioavailability in diabetic nephropathy by reduced catabolism for oxidation to BH2. The reduced BH4 oxidation by ARB leads to eNOS recoupling and results in increased NO and reduced ROS production by the enzyme. BH4 bioavailability is potently influenced by oxidative stress, by the downregulation of GTPCH1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] and by oxidation to inactive BH2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Recently, Chalupsky <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] demonstrated the role of dihydrofolate reductase in the regulation of BH4 and NO bioavailability in the endothelium. Endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase-derived hydrogen peroxide downregulated dihydrofolate reductase expression in response to angiotensin II, resulting in BH4 deficiency and uncoupling of eNOS. Moreover, Xu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>] demonstrated that diabetic hyperglycaemia activates the 26S proteasome via peroxynitrite and results in the ubiquitination and degradation of GTPCH1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme for BH4 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. We confirmed that nitrotyrosine formation, peroxynitrite indicator, was elevated in diabetic glomeruli and attenuated by losartan treatment. Moreover, we confirmed that GTPCH1 protein expression levels were decreased in diabetic glomeruli and attenuated by losartan treatment without affecting mRNA expression, so it may influence the GTPCH1 activity. As a result, losartan may improve eNOS uncoupling in STZ-induced diabetic glomeruli.</p><p>On the other hand, statins are reported to potentiate GTPCH1 gene expression and BH4 synthesis, thereby improving eNOS function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Administration of the calcium channel blocker, benidipine, is also reported to be effective in preventing BH4 deficiency by activating GTPCH1 in type II diabetic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. GTPCH1 is also subject to posttranslational modification by phosphorylation. In rat mesangial cells, Ang II and platelet-derived growth factor are reported to increase GTPCH1 activity by phosphorylation via a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>]. However, the role of GTPCH1 phosphorylation in ECs has not been determined.</p><p>The 2-week ARB treatment did not cause significant pathological changes in the kidneys of STZ rats. However, ARB treatment resulted in a significant reduction of albuminuria. It is possible that this effect is the result of improvement of endothelial function. Improvement of eNOS uncoupling including BH4 by ARB treatment leads to increased NO viability and maintenance of endothelial function; then ARB would reduce microalbuminuria in STZ rat. Recently, the usefulness of microalbuminuria in predicting increased risk of cardiovascular and renal diseases is well established in diabetic patients, as well as in essential hypertensive patients and in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Thus, the reduction of microalbuminuria could then be a relevant therapeutic strategy for reducing or preventing cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes and essential hypertension.</p><p>Changes of NO production have been associated with glomerular hyperfiltration, vascular permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. ARB including losartan can induce glomerular haemodynamics improvement by reducing efferent artery resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. So losartan may improve the eNOS&#x02013;BH4 coupling by improving glomerular hyperfiltration and/or endothelial function. In renal diseases, glomerular haemodynamic improvement reduces oxidative stress. We have demonstrated that, in a subtotal nephrectomized rats model that shows increased glomerular hyperfiltration, glomerular superoxide production was increased and ARB ameliorated superoxide production by attenuating NAD(P)H oxidase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. On the other hand, in aorta of the rat STZ model, ARB has been reported to improve eNOS uncoupling by inhibiting NAD(P)H oxidase activity, so losartan may improve eNOS uncoupling by direct action to the glomerular endothelium. So, losartan may demonstrate its anti-oxidative effects by both reducing glomerular hypertension and direct endothelial protection.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated in the present study that the imbalance between NO and ROS contributes to renal dysfunction in diabetic nephropathy. ARB improved eNOS uncoupling by increasing serum BH4 level, which contributed to the reduction in diabetic glomerular ROS production. These mechanisms add a new dimension to the renoprotective effects of ARB in diabetic nephropathy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mrs Sawako Tsujita for the animal care.
