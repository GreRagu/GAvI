In the current study, we have experimentally demonstrated that, the potent inhibition we obtained previously for one of these enzymes (i.e. sirtuin type 1 (SIRT1)) by simply replacing N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-thioacetyl-lysine for N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-acetyl-lysine in its peptide substrate, represented a general and efficient strategy to develop potent and selective inhibitors of human NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylase enzymes. Indeed, by using this simple inhibition strategy, potent (low-micromolar) and selective (&#x02264;40-fold) SIRT2 and SIRT3 inhibitors, which were either comparable or superior to currently existing inhibitors, have also been quickly identified in the current study.

Introduction</title><p>Reversible lysine N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-acetylation on proteins has been increasingly recognized to play critical roles in regulating multiple pivotal cellular processes such as gene transcription, cell-cycle progression, and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-1-001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-1-001">13</xref>]. This reversible lysine N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-acetylation is coordinated by protein acetyltransferases and protein deacetylases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-1-001">Figure 1</xref>). As such, chemical modulation of these enzymes could offer therapeutic benefits for treating human diseases including metabolic and age-related diseases and cancer. This modulation could also be a chemical biological approach to further deciphering the biology of these enzymes.</p><p>Human protein deacetylases have been categorized into class I, II, III, and IV subfamilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-9-1-001">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-1-001">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-9-1-001">15</xref>]. Class I, II, and IV (also collectively known as classical) enzymes include the 11 HDACs, i.e. HDAC1-11 (HDAC is the abbreviation for histone deacetylase that is named after the first discovered protein substrate histone), and they all require a catalytic zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>). Class III enzymes include the 7 human sirtuins, i.e. SIRT1-7 (sirtuin type 1&#x02013;7). However, among the 7 human sirtuins, only SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT5 have been demonstrated to be <italic>bona fide</italic> protein deacetylases, and they all require coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) for activity. SIRT4 and SIRT6 are ADPribosyltransferases, whereas an enzymatic activity for SIRT7 has not been identified.</p><p>As compared to the long-standing active pursuit of inhibitors of Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent classical enzymes, the development of inhibitors/activators of the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylases has only gained pace recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijms-9-1-001">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-1-001">13</xref>]. Regarding the inhibitor development for these latter enzymes, up to this date, there have been only two research reports disclosing the discovery of not only potent but also selective inhibitors, i.e. an indole-based SIRT1 inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0223c;98 nM) reported by Napper, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-9-1-001">16</xref>] and a SIRT2 inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0223c;3.5 &#x003bc;M) reported by Outeiro, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-9-1-001">17</xref>]. Weak (micromolar level) and/or nonselective (inhibiting multiple deacetylases within the class III subfamily and/or also inhibiting enzymes outside of this subfamily) inhibition was observed for all the other currently reported inhibitors whose potency and selectivity have been sufficiently addressed. Therefore, developing novel inhibition strategies and inhibitors for human NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylases is expected to constitute an active research area in years to come.</p><p>By evaluating human p53 tumor suppressor protein C-terminal peptides (amino acid residues 372&#x02013;389) containing N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-thioacetyl-lysine (peptide <bold>1a</bold>) or N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-acetyl-lysine (Peptide <bold>1b</bold>) at the 382 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1-001">Figure 2</xref>), we previously demonstrated that, whereas the two peptides were comparably de(thio)acetylated by HDAC8, peptide <bold>1a</bold> was a potent inhibitor for SIRT1 with an IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0223c;2 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-1-001">18</xref>], only secondary to the indole-based SIRT1 inhibitor reported by Napper, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-9-1-001">16</xref>]. Our previous experimental data further suggested that the observed potent SIRT1 inhibition by peptide <bold>1a</bold> could be conferred by its processing by SIRT1, but with the formation of a longer-lived catalytically less competent intermediate following the nicotinamide cleavage step, as compared to the normal processing of peptide <bold>1b</bold> by SIRT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-1-001">18</xref>]. Because the catalytic domains were predicted to be highly conserved among the four currently known human NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylases, i.e. SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-1-001">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-9-1-001">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijms-9-1-001">19</xref>], we hypothesized that the potent SIRT1 inhibition by peptide <bold>1a</bold> has defined a simple yet general and effective inhibition strategy for all human NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylases, i.e. the transformation of peptide substrates to potent peptide inhibitors by simple replacement of N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-thioacetyl-lysine for N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-acetyl-lysine. Because physiological substrates have been identified for SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3, but not yet for SIRT5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-9-1-001">6</xref>], we chose SIRT2 and SIRT3 to test our hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results|discussion"><title>2.

Peptides <bold>3b</bold> and <bold>3c</bold> were used, respectively, as the substrate and the synthetic authentic deacetylation peptide product for the HPLC-based SIRT3 inhibition assay. Peptide <bold>1b</bold> was also employed as an <italic>in vitro</italic> substrate in our HPLC-based SIRT2 inhibition assay because we found that, albeit being &#x0223c;8-fold less efficiently processed by SIRT2 as compared to by SIRT1, peptide <bold>1b</bold> still gave rise to reliable signal when longer reaction times were used.</p><p>All the inhibition assays with SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3 were performed under initial conditions (turnover of the limiting substrate was maintained at &#x02264;12%) (see Experimental Section). Linear Dixon plots (1/v<sub>0</sub> vs. [inhibitor]) were obtained from all the assay data, and were used to estimate IC<sub>50</sub> values as an indication of the inhibition potency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-1-001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>It is apparent from <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-1-001">Table 1</xref> that peptides <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3a</bold> also turned out to be potent inhibitors for SIRT2 (IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0223c;11 &#x003bc;M) and SIRT3 (IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0223c;5 &#x003bc;M), respectively. Indeed, peptide <bold>3a</bold> represented the very first potent SIRT3 inhibitor ever identified. These data strongly supported our hypothesis that the potent SIRT1 inhibition by peptide <bold>1a</bold> has defined a simple yet general and effective inhibition strategy for all human NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylases, i.e. the transformation of peptide substrates to potent peptide inhibitors by simple replacement of N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-thioacetyl-lysine for N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-acetyl-lysine.</p><p>Peptides <bold>1a</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, and <bold>3a</bold> were further evaluated for their possible selective inhibition among SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-1-001">Table 1</xref>: i) peptide <bold>1a</bold> was found to have a comparable inhibition potency against SIRT2 to that against SIRT1, but a &#x0223c;35-fold weaker inhibition potency against SIRT3; ii) peptide <bold>2</bold> was found to be a &#x0223c;10-fold and &#x0223c;40-fold weaker inhibitor for SIRT1 and SIRT3, respectively, as compared to its inhibition against SIRT2; iii) peptide <bold>3a</bold> was found to be a comparably potent inhibitor for both SIRT2 and SIRT3, but a &#x0223c;5-fold stronger inhibitor for SIRT1. The rationale behind our decision to evaluate the relative inhibition potencies of peptides <bold>1a</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, and <bold>3a</bold> among SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3 was that, if the amino acid residues surrounding the &#x0201c;warhead&#x0201d; (i.e. N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-thioacetyl-lysine) in these peptides defined different &#x0201c;addresses&#x0201d; that were to be recognized by different enzymes, selective inhibition ought to be obtained. That we indeed observed different degrees of selective inhibition supported this rationale. However, several findings in our current study need further discussion, most notably the strong inhibition of peptide <bold>1a</bold> against SIRT2 and peptide <bold>3a</bold> against both SIRT1 and SIRT2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-1-001">Table 1</xref>), because peptides <bold>1a</bold> and <bold>3a</bold> were based on peptide templates derived from the SIRT1 physiological substrate human p53 protein and the SIRT3 physiological substrate human AceCS2, respectively. These results could imply that, under certain <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, SIRT2 could also accept human p53 protein and AceCS2 as its substrates and SIRT1 could also accept AceCS2 as its substrate. Alternatively, these <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental data with purified recombinant enzymes may not fully account for the substrate selection by these enzymes <italic>in vivo</italic>, which could also be regulated by both spatial and temporal mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 Possible HDAC8-catalyzed dethioacetylation of peptide-based inhibitors</title><p>Our previous demonstration that peptides <bold>1a</bold> and <bold>1b</bold> were comparably de(thio)acetylated by HDAC8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-1-001">18</xref>] suggested that, when placed within an appropriate amino acid sequence, the thioacetyl group can serve as a functional mimic for the acetyl group for the enzymatic deacetylation reaction catalyzed by HDAC8. In a subsequent set of experiments employing the HeLa nuclear extracts enriched in HDAC1 and HDAC2 as well as the purified recombinant HDAC1 and HDAC2 as enzyme preparations, we previously further demonstrated that the replacement of N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-thioacetyl-lysine for N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-acetyl-lysine conferred resistance to HDACs other than HDAC8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijms-9-1-001">25</xref>]. Taken together, these previous experimental results argued for the notion that, when placed within an appropriate amino acid sequence, the thioacetyl group can serve as a functional mimic for the acetyl group only for HDAC8-catalyzed reaction. Therefore, in the current study, we sought to determine if peptides <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3a</bold> could also be dethioacetylated by HDAC8, because the lability of a N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-thioacetyl-lysine-containing peptide toward HDAC8 is expected to diminish its value as a chemical biological research tool or a potential therapeutic agent.</p><p>In a HPLC-based HDAC8 assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-1-001">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-9-1-001">20</xref>], peptides <bold>1b</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, and <bold>3a</bold> were allowed to be incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the HDAC8 assay buffer. While &#x0223c;10% substrate turnover from peptide <bold>1b</bold> was observed, no detectable formation of the dethioacetylated peptide products was observed from both peptides <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3a</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-1-001">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that, unlike peptides <bold>1a</bold> and <bold>1b</bold>, peptides <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3a</bold> could not be dethioacetylated by HDAC8 under the same experimental conditions.</p><p>Taken together with section 2.1, we have experimentally demonstrated that, the potent inhibition we obtained previously for SIRT1 by simply replacing N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-thioacetyl-lysine for N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-acetyl-lysine in its peptide substrate, represented a general and efficient strategy to develop potent and selective inhibitors of human NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylase enzymes. Furthermore, we have identified a potent and selective SIRT2 inhibitor (peptide <bold>2</bold>) and a potent pan-sirtuin (among SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3) inhibitor (peptide <bold>3a</bold>) that showed resistance to enzymatic dethioacetylation by classical HDAC enzymes. Peptides <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3a</bold> will thus be expected to be valuable as chemical tools for deciphering the biology of these human sirtuins. Even though these peptide-based inhibitors might not be cell permeable, they could be ferried inside a cell by their conjugation (e.g. <italic>via</italic> a disulfide linkage) to various types of protein transduction domain (PTD) peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijms-9-1-001">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijms-9-1-001">30</xref>]. Once a PTD peptide carries an inhibitor as cargo across cellular membranes, the cargo can be released inside a cell (e.g. following the cleavage of a disulfide linkage due to a reductive intracellular environment). Peptides <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3a</bold> shall also be valuable lead compounds for developing inhibitors with enhanced potency, selectivity, metabolic stability, and cellular membrane permeability. Toward this goal of developing improved inhibitors suitable for <italic>in vivo</italic> applications, the following stepwise strategy could be considered. i) To obtain structurally more manageable minimal peptide sequences <italic>via</italic> peptide truncation. The feasibility of peptide sequence truncation without drastic loss of inhibition potency could be supported by the following studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijms-9-1-001">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijms-9-1-001">32</xref>]: a) a previous X-ray structural analysis of a sirtuin enzyme with peptide <bold>1b</bold> showed that N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-acetyl-lysine and the two amino acid residues on each side of N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-acetyl-lysine were the peptide residues that made predominant binding interactions with the sirtuin enzyme used; b) multiple 5-mer peptides harboring N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-acetyl-lysine in their middle positions were identified from a combinatorial peptide library to serve as good SIRT1 substrates. This feasibility was further directly supported by our observed modest decrease (ca. 6-fold) in inhibition potency following truncation of the 18-mer peptide <bold>1a</bold> to a 5-mer peptide (i.e. H<sub>2</sub>N-HK(ThAcK)LM-COOH) (Fatkins and Zheng, unpublished results). ii) To construct and screen (against various human sirtuins) a focused peptide library in which all the library members will have N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-thioacetyl-lysine occupying their middle positions. iii) To perform further medicinal chemistry manipulations on library hits. While maintaining the potency and selectivity of hits, their metabolic stability and cellular membrane permeability could be potentially enhanced through the minimization of their peptidic nature.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>3.

No detectable formation of the corresponding dethioacetylated peptide from peptide <bold>2</bold> was also observed under the same assay conditions. All peptide stock solutions were prepared in ddH<sub>2</sub>O. IC<sub>50</sub> values were estimated from Dixon plots (1/v<sub>0</sub> vs. [inhibitor]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijms-9-1-001">36</xref>] as an indication of the inhibition potency.</p></sec><sec><title>3.3 Assay with recombinant HDAC8</title><p>The rcombinant HDAC8 (Cat. <bold>#</bold>SE145-0100) was purchased from BIOMOL International L.P. (Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA). The HPLC-based HDAC8 assay was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-1-001">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-9-1-001">20</xref>]. In brief, a HDAC8 assay solution had the following components: 25 mM Tris&#x02022;HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mg/mL BSA (SIGMA Cat. #A3803 with reduced fatty acid content), 0.3 mM peptide <bold>1b</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, or <bold>3a</bold>, and 1.5 &#x003bc;M HDAC8. An enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of HDAC8 at room temperature and was allowed to be incubated at room temperature for 2 h before quenched with the following stop solution: 1.0 M HCl and 0.16 M acetic acid. The quenched assay solutions were directly injected into a reversed-phase HPLC C18 column (100 &#x000c5;, 0.46 x 25 cm), eluting with the following gradients of ddH<sub>2</sub>O containing 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile containing 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (mobile phase B): linear increase from 0% B to 35% B (for the assay with peptide <bold>2</bold> or <bold>1b</bold>) or 40% B (for the assay with peptide <bold>3a</bold> or <bold>1b</bold>) from 0&#x02013;40 min (1 mL/min), and UV monitoring at 214 nm. Under the HDAC8 assay conditions, the deacetylated peptide (i.e. peptide <bold>1c</bold>) was formed from peptide <bold>1b</bold> as we observed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-1-001">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-9-1-001">20</xref>], however, no detectable formation of the corresponding dethioacetylated peptides from peptides <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3a</bold> was observed. The enzymatically formed peptide <bold>1c</bold> was confirmed by its comigration with the chemically synthesized authentic sample and by MALDITOF mass spectrometric analysis, and was quantified by HPLC peak integration and comparison with that of synthetic authentic sample. Under the same assay conditions, no detectable formation of peptide <bold>1c</bold> was observed for non-enzymatic reactions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>In the current study, we have experimentally demonstrated that, the potent inhibition we obtained previously for SIRT1 by simply replacing N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-thioacetyl-lysine for N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>-acetyl-lysine in its peptide substrate, represented a general and efficient strategy to develop potent and selective inhibitors of human NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylase enzymes. Due to their resistance to enzymatic dethioacetylation by classical HDAC enzymes, the potent and selective SIRT2 inhibitor peptide <bold>2</bold> and the potent pan-sirtuin (among SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3) inhibitor peptide <bold>3a</bold> identified in the current study will be expected to be valuable as chemical tools for deciphering the biology of these human sirtuins. The availability of various types of PTD peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijms-9-1-001">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijms-9-1-001">30</xref>] should promote the cellular applications of these peptide-based inhibitors by carrying them through cellular membranes. Furthermore, peptides <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3a</bold> shall be valuable lead compounds for further focused structure-activity optimization.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the James L. and Martha J.

Their conclusion that this histone H3 peptide behaved as a mechanism-based inhibitor agreed with our previous mechanistic suggestion that the observed potent SIRT1 inhibition by peptide <bold>1a</bold> could be conferred by its processing by SIRT1, but with the formation of a longer-lived catalytically less competent intermediate following the nicotinamide cleavage step, as compared to the normal processing of peptide <bold>1b</bold> by SIRT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-1-001">18</xref>]. In their paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ijms-9-1-001">37</xref>], Smith, et al. also described their discovery that the above histone H3 peptide behaved as a potent inhibitor against SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT3 with respective IC<sub>50</sub> values being 2.0 &#x000b1; 0.2 &#x003bc;M, 5.6 &#x000b1; 0.8 &#x003bc;M, and 2.3 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x003bc;M, when assayed against the sirtuin-catalyzed deacetylation of a <sup>3</sup>H-acetylated histone H3 peptide substrate. However, whether or not their inhibitor could be dethioacetylated by HDAC8 was not examined.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ijms-9-1-001"><label>1</label><citation
