To determine the appropriate time point for isolating total RNA, we first observed the morphological changes of cell surface structures in each strain along with the bacterial growth. In general, the growth of strain 17-2 was faster than that of strain 17, entering into an exponential phase at around 12 h and reaching the plateau in 24 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, open rhombus). Strain 17-2 did not show the presence of cell-associated fibrous materials at any stage of the growth cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). By contrast, strain 17 showed a slower growth rate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, hatched square) with a longer exponential growth phase. Morphological observation of cultures at different stages of growth revealed that strain 17 exhibited cell surface-associated meshwork-like structures at 12 h and the structures became denser with time (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). From these preliminary data, 12 h-old cultures of strains 17 and 17-2 were chosen for a comparison of gene expression patterns.

It is evidently shown that the slime/EPS production is critical for bacteria to exhibit the resistance to the neutrophil phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], though some EPS are not essential to bacterial adherence to host cells or for systemic virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Leid <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] have shown that human leukocytes can easily penetrate <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>biofilms but fail to phagocytose the bacteria. Though we have to carefully investigate the possibility that multiple mutations exist in strain 17-2 and lead to the observed incapability to induce abscesses in mice, it is conceivable that biofilm bacteria being held together by EPS as in this case with strain 17 might present a huge physical challenge for phagocytosing neutrophils. In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], we observed the restoration of the induction of abscess formation in mice when the purified EPS from the biofilm-forming strain of <italic>P. nigrescens </italic>was added to the cultures of a biofilm-non-forming mutant and injected into mice. As a consequence of these neutrophils being frustrated by their inability to phagocytose this bacterial mass, this might trigger the unregulated release of bactericidal compounds that could cause tissue injury as shown in the inflammatory pathway associated with lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] or chronic wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].

When we compare the microarray expression data obtained from strain 17 as bacterial cells were producing EPS to those of strain 17-2 as EPS non-producing variant, stress inducible heat shock proteins were up-regulated in strain 17 at a gene transcriptional level. We can not particularize functions of these genes in biofilm formation of <italic>P. intermedia </italic>since a genetic transfer system for having gene-targeted mutants of this organism yet remains to be developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].

We found in our earlier study that exposing biofilm-positive <italic>P. intermedia </italic>to environmental stress such as animal passages of the organism resulted in the up-regulations of HSPs at a protein level with increased production of cell surface-associated meshwork-like structures. By contrast, animal passages induced neither the production of viscous materials nor the up-regulation of HSPs in strain 17-2 (unpublished data).</p><p>When we compared the gene expression profiles of strain 17 cells plated on BAPs to those of planktonic cells in enriched-TSB, transcriptional levels of several genes including those for a levanase (ScrL: PINA0149), putative &#x003c3;<sup>E </sup>(PINA0299) and a polysialic acid transport protein (KpsD: PINA1911) were dramatically up-regulated on cells from the solid culture media.

Although plating of planktonic cells at an exponential phase itself is known to immediately induce the expression of heat shock regulons in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], we now hypothesize that, like AlgU (&#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>) in <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], <italic>P. intermedia </italic>strain 17 cells keep their stress response via one of ECF sigma factors activated; thus rendering this organism to maintain EPS production at high levels in different growth conditions. However, so far we studied, gene clusters responsible for mannose-rich EPS still remain to be elucidated.

The threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>) values were obtained for the reactions reflecting the quantity of the template in the sample. &#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>for each gene was calculated by subtracting the calibrator gene 16S rRNA C<sub>T </sub>value from each of the target values represented the relative quantity of the target mRNA normalized to the level of the internal standard 16S rRNA mRNA level. The target mRNA levels in strains 17 and 17-2 were defined and compared.</p><p>To observe how the expression levels of these genes fluctuate through the culture period, single colony of strains 17 and 17-2 grown on BAP for 24 h were inoculated into enriched-TSB and grown for 24 h as the seed culture. One hundred and fifty &#x003bc;l of this seed culture was used to inoculate 15 ml of enriched-TSB. Total RNA samples were extracted from 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 h cultures of strains 17 and 17-2 using RNeasy Midi Kit (QIAGEN) and applied to the real-time RT-PCR as described above. Changes of the target mRNA levels through the culture period were recorded by the strain.</p></sec><sec><title>Animal studies</title><p>The virulence of biofilm-forming strain 17 was compared with that of biofilm-non-forming variant strain 17-2 regarding abscess formation in mice. Bacterial strains were cultured in enriched-TSB for 24 h for strain 17-2 and 36 h for strain 17, respectively (early stationary phase; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Five hundred &#x003bc;l of bacterial suspensions (10<sup>6 </sup>to 10<sup>10 </sup>CFU/ml) was injected subcutaneously into the inguen of each BALB/c mouse (male, 4 weeks; 3 mice per strain). Changes of abscess lesions were recorded photographically using a camera (Nikon FIII, Nikon, Japan) set at a fixed magnification for five consecutive days.</p></sec><sec><title>Phagocytosis assay</title><p>To compare anti-phagocytic activity of strain 17 with that of strain 17-2, bacterial cells were co-cultured with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) obtained from healthy human volunteers (n = 3; age 20&#x02013;23 years) in accordance with institutional approved procedures. PMNLs were purified by a PolymorphprepTM (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) gradient and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (MultiSer, Trace Scientific Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Bacterial cell suspensions (1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>CFU/ml) were prepared from strains 17 and 17-2 cultures as described in the animal studies. Three hundred &#x003bc;l of PMNLs (10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml) was dispensed into the wells of 24-well tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). To these wells, 100 &#x003bc;l of bacterial suspension of different tested strains was added. After incubation for 60&#x02013;90 min at 37&#x000b0;C, PMNLs co-cultured with bacterial cells were centrifuged at 8,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>at 4&#x000b0;C for 5 min and processed for transmission electron microscopy to determine the internalization of tested strains by PMNLs. Cell pellets were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C, post-fixed with 1% OsO<sub>4 </sub>in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C, and dehydrated through an ethanol series. Samples were embedded into Epon resin and ultrathin sections were prepared by a ultramicrotome (Ultracut, Leica, Tokyo, Japan). Ultrathin sections were placed on a copper grid, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed in a TEM (H7100, Hitachi).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TY, TF and CM carried out the phenotype characterization and microarray analysis, and drafted the manuscript.
