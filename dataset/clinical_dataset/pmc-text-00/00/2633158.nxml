A light of radiographic examination, we describe three Turkish young males with multiple impacted teeth who didn&#x02019;t possess any systemic conditions or syndromes involving both jaws. The first patient, a 21-year-old young male, had 16 unerupted teeth and 5 unerupted supernumerary teeth. The second patient with totally edentulous mandible, a 20-year-old young male, had 31 unerupted teeth. The third patient, a 21-year-old young male, had 22 unerupted teeth and 4 unerupted supernumerary teeth. Based on the clinical presentation, radiographic examination and histopathological studies, this paper discusses the differential diagnosis and management of such cases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Impacted teeth</kwd><kwd>Cleidocranial dysplasia</kwd><kwd>Gardner&#x02019;s syndrome</kwd><kwd>Supernumerary teeth</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Impaction of teeth can result firstly from local biomechanical impediments, and secondarily from childhood maxillofacial or dentoalveolar trauma, reconstructive surgery of the facial skeleton, malpositioning of an adjacent tooth, thickened overlying osseous or mucosal tissues, insufficient maxillofacial skeletal development or a low correlation between maxillofacial skeletal development and tooth maturation, eruption disturbances and owing to direct or indirect effects of cysts or neoplasm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-0020073">1</xref> A host of systemic prenatal and postnatal disorders, diseases and syndromes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-0020073">Table 1</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-0020073">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-0020073">2</xref> can also cause tooth impaction.

The circumference of the head were measured as 57 cm. None of these measurements deviated from the norm. Facially, he had a broad, flat, fleshy nose. His ears were thick and floppy. Despite the fact that the examination of the hands showed normal findings, the examination of the feet showed that the nails of his toes were hypoplastic bilaterally and the third toes were rudimentary. In addition, congenital curly (or varus) toe was noted that on left foot&#x02019;s fourth and fifth toes and right foot&#x02019;s fifth toe and was also noted that hammer toe on both of feet&#x02019;s toes were apart from first toes. No other family members were known to have similar abnormalities of the hands and feet. Radiological evaluations of the clavicles, vertebral skeleton, skull and chest proved to be normal. Ophthalmological and neurological examination of the patient revealed no pathological symptoms. Intelligence was subjectively normal. There was no pes cavus. A joint hypermobility involving the metatarsophalangeal and knee joints was noted. Liver and spleen were not palpable. The skin was dry, soft and velvety.

The oral soft tissues of our cases were unremarkable and histopathological evaluations of gingivae were normal. The clinical and radiographic examinations of our cases revealed relatively normal jaws and teeth despite the fact that some dental crown-root abnormalities were detected on case 2. Abnormalities of tooth morphology are related to inadequate space and arrested eruption. Delayed or arrested eruption is probably caused by diminished resorption of bone and of primary teeth and to the presence of multiple supernumerary teeth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-0020073">3</xref> Conditions which cause lacking of eruptive force in such cases could be due to either general, endocrinal, neurogenic or mucosal and bone disorder. Especially, at the case 2 operation dense compact bone in the mandible was observed. Conditions where we find retained teeth are: hemifacial atrophy, hypopitutarism, hypothyroidism, cherubism, gingival fibromatosis, cleft palate and preceding syndromes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-0020073">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-0020073">7</xref> On account of the fact that the medical history of our cases was non-contributory; above conditions were excluded.</p><p>Babu et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-0020073">3</xref> stated that the exact cause and the significance of multiple impacted supernumerary teeth remain an enigma to us. Multiple supernumerary teeth without any associated systemic conditions or syndromes are not common and often associated with various syndromes. Review of the literature revealed only a few reported cases. Leslie<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-0020073">14</xref> reported of a 25-year old black male with non-syndrome multiple impacted supernumerary teeth that resembled regular mandibulary premolar teeth. Yucel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-0020073">15</xref> and Yusof<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-0020073">16</xref> also reported similar cases in a young adult patient&#x02019;s maxilla and mandible. Yusof<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-0020073">16</xref> reviewed most of the cases reported in the English language literature from 1969 to 1990 and found that there was a predilection of non-syndrome multiple supernumerary teeth that occur in the mandible. However, in our patients (case 1 and 3) nine unerupted supernumerary teeth were noted, eight of them were in the maxillary and the other was in the mandible.</p><p>The frontal sinus is the only sinus that cannot be recognized radiologically in the neonate. The frontal diverticulum is present, but the frontal bone is not pneumatized until between the first and second years of life. The frontal sinus may assume its definite shape as early as the third year of life, but continued growth and development are carried well into puberty. The frontal sinus is capable of extremes of under and over development. Agenesis and massive pneumatization are both seen with regularity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-0020073">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-0020073">18</xref> Maxillary sinus hypoplasia is rare, with an estimated prevalence of 1&#x02013;5%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-0020073">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-0020073">20</xref> Occasionally the lumen of the maxillary sinus may be small and its bony walls thick as a result of incomplete pneumatization and development. Complete failure of development of the antral lumen and total absence of the maxillary sinus are rare.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-0020073">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-0020073">19</xref> Rhinootolaryngologycal examination of our patient (case 2) revealed no pathological symptom. But CT scan of the paranasal sinus evaluations showed frontal sinus agenesis and maxillary sinus hypoplasia. Besides, an instance of physical trauma to the left frontal region during childhood and recurrent bronchitis were detected.</p><p>To achieve optimum function and aesthetics, an interdisciplinary cooperation between the oral surgeon, orthodontist, prosthodontist and pedodontist should be based for the management of the case.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-0020073">6</xref></p><p>The concept of treatment of these cases contains serial examination of primary teeth, removal of the supernumerary teeth, assisting the eruption of the permanent teeth by orthodontic traction or surgical exposure and any impacted tooth which couldn&#x02019;t erupt after surgical or orthodontic methods needs extraction and replacement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-0020073">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-0020073">21</xref></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-0020073"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alling</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name><name><surname>Catone</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Management of impacted teeth</article-title><source>J Oral Maxillofac Surg</source><year>1993</year><volume>51</volume><issue>suppl 1</issue><fpage>3</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8419585</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b2-0020073"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gorlin</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hennekam</surname><given-names>RCM</given-names></name></person-group><source>Syndromes of the Head and Neck</source><edition>Fourth</edition><publisher-name>Oxford University Press</publisher-name><publisher-loc>US</publisher-loc><year>2001</year></citation></ref><ref id="b3-0020073"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Babu</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagesh</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name><name><surname>Diwakar</surname><given-names>NR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A rare case of hereditary multiple impacted normal and supernumerary teeth</article-title><source>J Clin Pediatr Dent</source><year>1998</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>59</fpage><lpage>62</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10023236</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b4-0020073"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name><name><surname>Flaitz</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnston</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>A natural history of cleidocranial dysostosis</article-title><source>Am J Med Genet</source><year>2001</year><volume>104</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11746020</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b5-0020073"><label>5</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kirson</surname><given-names>LE</given-names></name><name><surname>Scheiber</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Tomaro</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Multiple impacted teeth in cleidocranial dysostosis</article-title><source>Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Path</source><year>1982</year><volume>54</volume><fpage>604</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6960316</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b6-0020073"><label>6</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A rare non-syndrome case of concomitant multiple supernumerary teeth and partial anodontia</article-title><source>J Clin Pediatr Dent</source><year>2001</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>167</fpage><lpage>169</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11314218</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b7-0020073"><label>7</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yalcin</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Gurbuzer</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Multiple impacted teeth in the maxilla</article-title><source>Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol</source><year>1993</year><volume>76</volume><fpage>130</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8351111</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b8-0020073"><label>8</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dayal</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name><name><surname>Chaudhary</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Desai</surname><given-names>KI</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Aarskog syndrome.
