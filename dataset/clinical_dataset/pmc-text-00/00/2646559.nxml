As the central hub of the secretory pathway, the Golgi receives newly synthesized proteins from the ER and sorts them into their correct cellular destinations. The orientation of the Golgi ribbon directs exocytosis toward a particular area of the plasma membrane and thereby facilitates the establishment of cell polarity, for instance, during wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>), neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Horton et al., 2005</xref>), and immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Stinchcombe et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>During cell division, the single Golgi ribbon needs to be segregated into the two daughter cells. To achieve partitioning, the Golgi fragments at the onset of mitosis, and later reforms in each daughter cell (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lowe and Barr, 2007</xref>). Two different mechanisms have been proposed for the partitioning of the Golgi. In one view, Golgi membranes are absorbed into and partitioned with the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zaal et al., 1999</xref>). The second view argues that the Golgi remains distinct from the ER and that the two compartments are inherited independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartz and Seemann, 2008</xref>). In this scenario, the spindle has been proposed as the machinery responsible for Golgi partitioning based on the observed accumulation of Golgi membranes at the spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Shima et al., 1998</xref>), although a pool of membranes is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jesch et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>To elucidate the role of the spindle in Golgi partitioning, we established an assay in which the entire spindle is segregated into only one daughter cell. Upon division, a Golgi ribbon reformed in the karyoplasts, whereas the stacked cisternae were scattered throughout the cytoplasts. We could rescue ribbon assembly in the cytoplasts by microinjecting the Golgi extract together with tubulin or by lowering the division temperature, at which partial spindle materials were transferred into the cytoplasts. We propose that Golgi factors required for ribbon assembly rely on the spindle for partitioning, but functional stacks are inherited independently. This reveals two levels of regulation underlying Golgi inheritance. Coupling of these factors with the spindle would ensure that daughter cells receive the information to assemble the Golgi ribbon, which is vital for cellular functions that require polarized secretion and directional migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To evaluate the role of the spindle in Golgi partitioning, we first examined the spatial correlation between Golgi membranes and the spindle. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Shima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jokitalo et al., 2001</xref>), we found Golgi membranes concentrated in metaphase around the two spindle poles in a variety of cell lines, including HeLa, Vero, LLC-PK1, normal rat kidney, and PtK1 (unpublished data). The association was prominent in PtK1 cells and was observed for both the stably expressed GFP-tagged Golgi enzyme <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyl transferase I (NAGT I) and the endogenous Golgi matrix protein GM130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). We occasionally observed aberrant monopolar, tripolar, and tetrapolar spindles and Golgi membranes clustered at the spindle poles as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D&#x02013;F</xref>). Moreover, accumulation of Golgi at the spindle poles was still evident when PtK1 cells were treated with the Eg5 inhibitors monastrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mayer et al., 1999</xref>) or trityl-cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Skoufias et al., 2006</xref>) to induce monopolar spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, G and H</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest a robust association of mitotic Golgi membranes with the spindle apparatus.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Mitotic Golgi membranes accumulate at the spindle poles.</bold> (A&#x02013;H) PtK1 cells were stained for the Golgi resident enzyme NAGT I&#x02013;GFP (A and B) or the Golgi matrix protein GM130 (C&#x02013;H; green), tubulin (red), and DNA (blue). Upon entry into mitosis, the Golgi ribbon (A) was disassembled into vesicles that clustered around the spindle poles in metaphase (B and C). Mitotic Golgi membranes concentrated at the spindle poles in cells containing monopolar (D), tripolar (E), or tetrapolar (F) spindles as well as in cells with monopolar spindles induced by an Eg5 inhibitor, either monastrol (G) or trityl-cysteine (H).

PtK1 cells stably expressing NAGT I&#x02013;GFP were treated with an Eg5 inhibitor, either monastrol or trityl-cysteine. Upon entry into mitosis, inhibition of the kinesin Eg5 blocks centrosome separation, leading to the formation of monoasters and the arrest of cells in M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mayer et al., 1999</xref>). Monoasters consist of microtubules emanating from nonseparated centrosomes and are surrounded by condensed chromosomes. Because PtK1 cells remain relatively flat during mitosis, monoasters are often asymmetrically located at one side of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canman et al., 2003</xref>). We induced cell division by two independent methods. We microinjected recombinant Mad1 to sequester Mad2 from the kinetochores, which silences the spindle checkpoint and allows progression through mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canman et al., 2003</xref>). We also found that asymmetrical cell division could be induced by inhibition of Cdk1 with roscovitine or purvalanol A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Niiya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hu et al., 2008</xref>). Both approaches generated a cytoplast without a nucleus and a nucleated karyoplast. Daughter cells were either identified by the injection marker (Mad1 injection) or monitored by time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy (Cdk1 inhibition).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>The Golgi in the karyoplasts but not in the cytoplasts reforms a ribbon.</bold> (A) Diagram of the assay. PtK1 cells stably expressing NAGT I&#x02013;GFP were treated with an Eg5 inhibitor (monastrol or trityl-cysteine) for 2 h to induce asymmetrically positioned monoasters. Cell division was triggered either by microinjection of Mad1 or by addition of a Cdk1 inhibitor (purvalanol A or roscovitine), leading to a karyoplast that received the entire spindle (centrosomes, chromosomes, and spindle microtubules) and a cytoplast that lacked all of these. (B&#x02013;I) Divided cells were either identified by the injection marker (B; Mad1 injection) or followed by time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy (F; Cdk1 inhibition). Cells were stained for GFP (C and G), tubulin (D and H), and DNA (E and I). The Golgi in the karyoplasts (arrows) reformed a characteristic ribbon in the perinuclear region, whereas the Golgi in the cytoplasts (asterisks) was scattered throughout the cytoplasm (C and G). In addition, no microtubule (MT) network was present in the cytoplasts (D and H). Bar, 10 &#x000b5;m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200809090_RGB_Fig2"/></fig><p>After division, the karyoplasts received the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and I</xref>), centrosomes (unpublished data), and microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, D and H</xref>), whereas the cytoplasts lacked all of these. Intriguingly, Golgi markers, including NAGT I&#x02013;GFP and GM130, were detected in both cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and G</xref>), suggesting that parts of the Golgi were partitioned independently of the spindle (<italic>n</italic> = 29 for Mad1 injection; and <italic>n</italic> &#x0003e; 50 for Cdk1 inhibition). However, the organization of the Golgi in the two daughter cells was very different. We analyzed the Golgi distribution in each daughter cell, where the Golgi was determined as a ribbon if 90% of the fluorescence resided in no more than three continuous structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>). The Golgi in the karyoplasts localized to the perinuclear region and exhibited the characteristic ribbon structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and G</xref>). In contrast, the Golgi in the cytoplasts was spread throughout the cytoplasm and failed to reform a ribbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and G</xref>). This indicates that the spindle has a direct role in inheritance of the Golgi ribbon.</p><p>To eliminate the possibility that the scattered Golgi in the cytoplasts might be caused by cell death, we followed both karyoplasts and cytoplasts by video microscopy. The cytoplasts survived on average 36 h after division and, in some cases, were still alive and seemingly healthy when corresponding karyoplasts underwent a second round of cell division.</p><p>The scattered Golgi and the absence of microtubules in the cytoplasts are reminiscent of cells treated with nocodazole, which causes the Golgi ribbon to fragment into stacks that are dispersed throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Shima et al., 1998</xref>). Our EM analysis revealed that the Golgi in both karyoplasts and cytoplasts was stacked with an average of 3.4 &#x000b1; 0.7 (karyoplast; <italic>n</italic> = 22) and 3.3 &#x000b1; 0.6 (cytoplast; <italic>n</italic> = 23) cisternae per stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). The cisternae were stacked to a comparable extent and separated by 11.8 &#x000b1; 3.8 (karyoplast) and 12.9 &#x000b1; 3.7 nm (cytoplast). To determine whether the stacks were polarized, we took advantage of a well-established fluorescence microscopy method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Shima et al., 1997</xref>). PtK1 cells stably expressing the medial/trans-Golgi enzyme NAGT I&#x02013;GFP were induced to divide asymmetrically and immunolabeled for GFP and the cis-Golgi marker GM130 (<italic>n</italic> = 15). In these triple-labeled cells, the GFP fluorescence was first overlaid with the anti-GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>) and was then overlaid with the anti-GM130 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, E and F</xref>). The anti-GFP staining served as a control, showing a complete overlap with the GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). In contrast, the cis&#x02013;anti-GM130 signal in the karyoplasts was found adjacent to the medial/trans-GFP fluorescence with only a partial overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>), suggesting that the ribbon in the karyoplasts preserved a cis-to-trans polarity. A similar segregation pattern was observed in the cytoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 F</xref>). Together with our EM data, we conclude that the scattered Golgi in the cytoplasts is stacked and polarized.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>The Golgi stacks in the cytoplasts are polarized and transport cargo.</bold> (A&#x02013;F) The Golgi in the cytoplasts is composed of polarized stacks. PtK1 cells stably expressing the medial/trans-Golgi enzyme NAGT I&#x02013;GFP were induced to divide asymmetrically and followed by video microscopy. Upon division, cells were either processed for EM (A and B) or for immunofluorescence (C&#x02013;F).

The mRNA of CD8, a plasma membrane protein not expressed in PtK1 cells, was injected together with Mad1 protein into cells with asymmetrical monoasters. Cells were incubated for 4 h to allow cell division, as well as synthesis and transport of cargo, and were fixed and stained before permeabilization. CD8 was detected on the cell surface in both karyoplasts and cytoplasts (<italic>n</italic> = 22; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 H</xref>) but not in cells with impaired secretion (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809090/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809090/DC1</ext-link>), indicating that the Golgi stacks in both cells transported cargo. To rule out that CD8 might have been expressed and transported before cytokinesis, we induced asymmetrical cell division in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. After the drug was removed to allow protein expression and transport, CD8 was detected on the cell surface of both cells (<italic>n</italic> = 9; unpublished data). In another approach, we injected CD8 mRNA into the cytoplasts generated by Cdk1 inhibition. CD8 appeared on the cell surface of the cytoplasts but not on the noninjected karyoplasts (<italic>n</italic> = 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 L</xref>). Similarly, myc-tagged protein A fused to the transmembrane domain of the PDGF receptor was also delivered to the cell surface (<italic>n</italic> = 15; Fig. S1 K). These findings indicate that the Golgi stacks in the cytoplasts are functional for secretion and do not require the spindle for partitioning.</p><p>In principle, the lack of a Golgi ribbon in the cytoplasts could be explained by two different mechanisms. First, the failure in ribbon assembly might be a result of the absence of microtubules in the cytoplasts because microtubules are essential to establish a Golgi ribbon. In this case, reformation of microtubules should restore the ribbon. Alternatively, the scattered Golgi stacks in the cytoplasts might be caused by the exclusion of the factors required for ribbon assembly (i.e., ribbon determinants). Ribbon determinants may associate with the spindle and are therefore not transferred to the cytoplasts. Supplying these factors should rescue ribbon formation. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we injected the missing materials into the cytoplasts and examined the Golgi morphology. Injection of tubulin resulted in a microtubule network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>), demonstrating that the cellular environment in the cytoplasts supports microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pelletier et al., 2000</xref>). However, the overall organization of Golgi stacks remained scattered (<italic>n</italic> = 14, five independent experiments; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>), indicating that the microtubules in the cytoplasts are not sufficient to reassemble a ribbon. Therefore, additional factors might be required but were presumably segregated along with the spindle into the karyoplasts. Because these factors may associate with Golgi membranes, we extracted rat liver Golgi (RLG) membranes with the nonionic detergent <italic>n</italic>-octylglucoside and removed the detergent by dialysis. Injection of Golgi extract alone had no effect (<italic>n</italic> = 12, four independent experiments; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>), but Golgi extract together with tubulin restored a ribbon (<italic>n</italic> = 8, five independent experiments; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 J</xref>) as well as a microtubule network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 K</xref>). Thus, the factors required for ribbon assembly are located on the Golgi.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Ribbon determinants are localized to the Golgi.</bold> (A&#x02013;L) Rescue of the ribbon by coinjection of Golgi extract with tubulin. Tubulin alone (A&#x02013;D) or Golgi extract without (E&#x02013;H) or with tubulin (I&#x02013;L) were microinjected into the cytoplasts (asterisks). After 2 h of incubation, cells were stained for GFP (B, F, and J), tubulin (C, G, and K), and DNA (D, H, and L). Injection of tubulin or Golgi extract alone had no effect (B and F, asterisks), whereas Golgi extract together with tubulin reconstituted a Golgi ribbon (J, asterisk).

RLG membranes were extracted with <italic>n</italic>-octylglucoside, cleared by centrifugation (pellet [P]), and the supernatant was dialyzed to remove the detergent (S). Equal volumes of each fraction were immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. Cis-Golgi proteins were de-enriched (e.g., Golgin84, GM130, and GRASP65), whereas markers of the medial/trans-Golgi and the TGN were enriched in the extract (e.g., Golgin45, GRASP55, Vti1a, and TGN38).

The mammalian Golgi ribbon is usually formed next to the centrosomes, which depends on the minus end&#x02013;directed microtubule motor dynein. We did not detect centrosomes in serial sections of RLG membranes by EM. In addition, neither the centrosomal marker pericentrin nor cytoplasmic dynein were detectable by Western blotting in the RLG fraction, although the proteins were present in the homogenate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 N</xref>). Similarly, the ER enzyme protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and the nuclear pore protein Nup153 were absent in the RLG fraction. In contrast, the Golgi proteins GM130 and GRASP65 were highly enriched. Interestingly, we found that medial/trans-Golgi markers were enriched in the Golgi extract, whereas cis-Golgi proteins were mostly depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 O</xref>). This implies that the factors required for postmitotic ribbon reassembly might have distinct molecular compositions from the cis-Golgi proteins Golgin84, GRASP65, and GM130 shown to be required for ribbon maintenance in interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Diao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>If the ribbon determinants are partitioned with the spindle, incorporation of parts of the spindle and its associated proteins into the cytoplasts should rescue ribbon formation. We followed asymmetrical cell division induced at lower temperature (32&#x000b0;C) and found that spindle positioning was dramatically altered, presumably caused by effects on microtubule dynamics (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809090/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809090/DC1</ext-link>).

However, at a lower temperature, the spindle was positioned centrally in close proximity to the division plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref> and Video 2), which allowed partial incorporation of spindle materials into the cytoplasts, as revealed by the presence of a microtubule network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>). Furthermore, a Golgi ribbon reformed (<italic>n</italic> = 21; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref>), suggesting that ribbon determinants were segregated into the cytoplasts.

By uncoupling cytokinesis from chromosome segregation, we have demonstrated that the spindle directly partitions the factors required for Golgi ribbon assembly, thus extending the role of the spindle beyond chromosome segregation. In addition, our approach provides a potential avenue for investigating the nature of cytoplasm in vivo and free from the influence of the nucleus. In our case, the cytoplasts contained all the machinery required for protein synthesis (i.e., ribosomes) and exocytosis (i.e., ER and Golgi).</p><p>The cytoplasts received Golgi stacks capable of secretion independently of the spindle, but these stacks were not linked into a ribbon. This is in contrast to the karyoplasts, in which a ribbon reformed. Collectively, our data suggest two distinct mechanisms underlying Golgi inheritance. First, minimum functional Golgi units (stacks) are inherited in a spindle-independent manner. These stacks could be derived from Golgi that was partitioned together with the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zaal et al., 1999</xref>) or could have reassembled from the Golgi that was segregated independently of the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jesch et al., 2001</xref>). Second, the mitotic spindle plays a vital role in transmitting ribbon determinants into the daughter cells.</p><p>The appearance of the Golgi ribbon in higher organisms during evolution reflects a different mechanism for polarized secretion. In lower animals such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, Golgi stacks are scattered and localized adjacent to ER exit sites despite the presence of centrosomes. Polarized secretion is achieved by targeting mRNA to specific ER exit sites where the cargo is made and secreted locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Herpers and Rabouille, 2004</xref>). However, in mammalian cells, cargo is posttranslationally sorted from the centrally located Golgi ribbon (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bard and Malhotra, 2006</xref>). To establish cell polarity, the entire Golgi ribbon is reoriented toward the site of secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bisel et al., 2008</xref>), which is essential for a variety of cellular processes such as the outgrowth of dendrites in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Horton et al., 2005</xref>), fibroblast migration during wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>), and the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Stinchcombe et al., 2006</xref>). Because the ribbon is particularly important for more advanced functions, tight coupling of ribbon determinants with the spindle ensures that each daughter cell receives the information to assemble it. This might be the reason that mammalian cells use the highly regulated spindle apparatus to partition these factors instead of a stochastic ER-dependent process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal antibodies against GM130, Golgin84, TGN38, GS15, GS28, Vti1a (BD), CD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), &#x003b1;-tubulin (TAT1; provided by K.
