Nuclear morphology and size were estimated by DNA Hoechst staining.</p><p><bold>Results.</bold> In infected tubular cells the early and late phases of infection could be distinguished according to expression of large T-antigen or VP-1. The early phase revealed almost normal nuclear proportions, whereas in later phases nuclear size increased about 2 to 3 fold. Expression of large T-antigen was strongly associated with accumulation of p53 in the nucleus, accompanied by the activation of the cell cycle associated cell protein Ki67. In contrast, expression of BKV VP1 correlated only weakly with p53. Virus dependent cell lysis was due to necrosis, since neither caspase 3 nor nuclear nor cytoskeleton changes indicated apoptosis.</p><p><bold>Conclusion.</bold> In our selected patients with PVAN a clear distinction between early and late phases was possible, according to the protein expression patterns of BKV markers. Striking nuclear enlargement is only present in the late phase of infection. In the inflammatory setting of PVAN, BKV dependent effects appear to be mediated by the inhibition of p53, resulting in the activation of the cell cycle. We assume that in PVAN similar BKV mechanisms are operative as in certain <italic>in vitro</italic> systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>BK virus nephropathy</kwd><kwd>renal transplantation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The BK virus (BKV) is a human polyomavirus first isolated from the urine of a kidney transplant patient with ureteric stenosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. A decade ago, BKV received renewed attention as a candidate of human disease and emerged as the principal agent of polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2 R3 R4 R5">2&#x02013;5</xref>] eliciting severe dysfunction of renal allografts with progressive graft loss in &#x0003e;90% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5 R6 R7">5&#x02013;7</xref>]. The emergence of PVAN among kidney transplants coincided with the widespread use of potent immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, thus implicating severely impaired antiviral immunity as a critical factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>].</p><p>In the course of disease, initially, so-called decoy cells, i.e. urothelial or tubular cells with virus inclusion bodies, are present in the urine. Later, renal biopsies show viral cytopathic changes in tubular cells, tubular cell necroses, interstitial inflammation and finally interstitial fibrosis. The definitive diagnosis of PVAN depends on characteristic cytopathic changes such as intranuclear inclusions in tubular epithelial cells and/or detection of BKV large T antigen by immunohistochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>].</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic>, the phases of the BKV infectious cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11">10,11</xref>] and the interaction of viral proteins with host cell proteins have been studied. However, <italic>in vivo</italic> and specifically in human renal allografts with ongoing BKV nephropathy, cross-talk between the virus and infected cell has not been systematically addressed. Whether <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> phases are similar is an open question; in this respect the majority of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies focused on the transforming effects of BKV. A better understanding of the <italic>in vivo</italic> BKV infectious cycle in PVAN may be of interest for making a more precise diagnosis.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the expression of early (large T-Ag) and late (VP-1) BKV proteins in frozen biopsy sections of a selected group of patients with ongoing BKV nephropathy by immunofluorescence (IF) and compared this with expression of host cellular proteins, such as the tumour suppressor protein p53, the cell cycle-associated protein Ki67, the cytokeratin CK22, the apoptosis marker caspase 3 and the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2. From these data we estimated the time course of the viral infectious cycle <italic>in vivo</italic> and the type of virus-dependent cell death.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In the present study, two biopsies and one explanted kidney allograft from three patients, representing the three different stages of PVAN, were studied by light microscopy in paraffin and by IF in frozen tissue sections.

To overcome slide-dependent differences in expression, two to five parallel sections were analysed and the data were pooled (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). The standard deviation (SD) indicates the variability between parallel sections. The expression of BKV large T-antigen and VP1 was correlated with nuclear size measuring the numbers of pixels per nucleus. Double-labelled sections were assessed for nuclear size and expression of viral markers utilizing the KS300 program.

In the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation of PVAN in each cell, a clear distinction between early and late phase infection can be made according to the expression of large T-antigen or VP1. The early phase is associated with nearly normal nuclear size and shape, but in later phases nuclear size increases dramatically, by about two- to threefold, when the nuclear cross-section area is evaluated.</p><p>This is fully in line with the recent <italic>in vitro</italic> data obtained from BKV infection in primary cultures of human tubular kidney epithelial cells and demonstrating a clear distinction of early and late phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. The expression of VP1 correlated strongly with the viral DNA replication, thereby indicating the late phase. These data confirm earlier studies&#x02014;already performed three decades ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14 R15">14,15</xref>] investigating BKV replication in monkey-derived kidney cells (Vero), in human a embryonic kidney cell line (HEK294) or human embryonic fibroblasts, which are not host cell targets <italic>in vivo</italic>. Just recently, Acott <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] utilized Vero cells as a model cell line to establish primary and chronic BKV infection <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>In all of our three cases with PVAN (stages A, B and C), virions were released after cell necrosis and not apoptosis, since activated caspase 3 was absent in infected cells and no nuclear alterations, such as nuclear shrinkage or apoptotic bodies, consistent with ongoing apoptosis, were seen by Hoechst dye. Supporting this concept, CK22 was also strongly expressed in virus-infected cells without any evidence for degradation of the cytoskeleton, typical for apoptosis.</p><p>This appears to be in contrast to animal studies of renal-transplanted cynomolgus monkeys with reactivation of the cynomolgus polyoma virus. Here, however, apoptosis affected smooth muscle cells of the ureter and cells of the small intestine. These differences may be explained by the differences in cell type, and by species differences between host and virus.</p><p>Our results are consistent with reports by Drachenberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] and Nickeleit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], who analysed the ultra-structural features of BKV nephropathy and described BKV-dependent necrosis in tubular infected cells as the main mechanism of viral lysis.</p><p>(2) Utilizing double labelling techniques, our study with three patients in three different stages of PVAN demonstrated a remarkable overlap of large T-antigen and p53 expression. About 70% of large T-antigen positive cells co-stained with p53. In 96% of p53 expressing tubular cells, a complete overlay with T-antigen in the nucleus was detected.</p><p>Our findings are in accordance with a recent study from Weinreb <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>] showing expression of p53 in tubular cells or bladder mucosa of renal-transplanted patients within cells revealing cytopathic changes or viral intranuclear inclusions. Expression of T-antigen was demonstrated on consecutive sections, but not by double labelling. Accordingly, our study clearly confirms the association of p53 and T-antigen and provides, in addition, the precise number of cells co-expressing T-antigen and p53 in PVAN.</p><p>Furthermore and intriguingly, 60% of T-antigen positive cells co-stained for the cell cycle-associated protein Ki67. Therefore, we assume that in the course of the BKV infection first T-antigen is expressed, then T-antigen accumulates and inhibits p53 in the nucleus and finally the cell cycle is activated, as can be seen by the Ki67 expression.</p><p>Our data give rise to the hypothesis that <italic>in vivo</italic> similar viral mechanisms control the key cell cycle checkpoint at the G1 to S phase transition, via inhibition of p53 to un-couple the cell cycle. <italic>In vitro</italic>, BKV T-antigen binds readily to the p53 protein in the cell, thereby inducing growth factor independence, but is, by itself, insufficient to allow anchorage-independent growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Many studies have addressed the process of neoplastic transformation by T-antigen in rodents or human cell culture systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. In our study, we investigated the natural course of BKV infection <italic>in vivo</italic> in renal allografts and provide evidence that similar p53 accumulation mechanisms are operative utilizing most likely wild type p53. <italic>In vitro</italic> data demonstrate that BKV T-antigen binds also to the members of the retinoblastoma family of molecules, thereby affecting cellular growth control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Over-expression of a wild-type p53 has been reported in the case of metastasizing urothelial carcinoma, which was restricted to large T-antigen co-expression and presumably binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>].</p><p>(3) Irrespective of the stage, all our three selected cases revealed the same overlap of expression between T-antigen and p53 and a virtually exclusive T-antigen and VP1 expression. Based on these data, we would like to make a rough hypothetical estimate of the length of the BKV life cycle <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, this appears to be necessarily preliminary since only three cases have been investigated. Assuming that the induction and binding of p53 by T-antigen would last 3 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>], which would correspond to the biological minimal induction time of p53 by other noxae (e.g. ionizing irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]), we could calculate from the 70% overlay of p53 and T-antigen a T-antigen expression period of 10 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The 20% overlay of VP1 expression and T-antigen would correspond to 2 h co-expression of the viral proteins. Consecutively, VP1 would be expressed for an additional 8 h finally resulting in the lysis of the infected cell. All together, from the start of T-antigen expression to virus-dependent lysis, &#x0223c;16 h are estimated. Taking into account that the period between virus reception and first viral transcriptional activity would last 24&#x02013;36 h, as described by Low <italic>et al</italic>., we arrive at a virus life cycle of 40&#x02013;52 h.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Estimation of the duration of the BKV infectious cycle <italic>in vivo</italic>. Assuming that the action of BKV T-antigen of p53 binding is a direct effect, a minimal induction time of p53 of 3 h could be assumed (see the Discussion section). From the 70% overlay of p53 and T-antigen a T-antigen expression period of 10 h is assessed. The 20% overlay of VP1 expression and T-antigen would correspond to 2 h co-expression of the viral proteins. Consecutively, VP1 would be expressed for an additional 8 h resulting finally in the lysis of the infected cell. Taking into account that the time between virus reception and first viral transcriptional activity would last 24&#x02013;36 h as described by Low <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] we arrive at a virus life cycle of 42&#x02013;54 h.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gfn470fig4"/></fig><p>Intriguingly, this time frame is fully in line with the data from Low <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] when infecting <italic>in vitro</italic> renal tubular epithelial cells with BKV and detecting progeny virus after 48 h. It is noteworthy, strictly speaking, that the time frame between virus uptake and transcriptional activity given by Low <italic>et al</italic>. is only valid for the primary infection and could differ in cases of reactivating BKV. Our data, however, support the view that, after expression of T-antigen and activation of the virus transcriptional machinery, BKV is released within the same time limits as for the primary infection, also indicating that novel infection of tubular cells after reactivation occurs within similar time frames.</p><p>(4) The Ki67 staining was found in tubular epithelial cells with and without large T-antigen expression. Although the presence of episomal viral DNA in these cells cannot be excluded (BKV infected), significant virus replication does not occur in these cells. Most likely, these proliferating cells correspond to cells repopulating the virus-mediated denudation zones as seen under the light microscope. Ki67-positive cells also staining positive for large T-antigen could either be a subpopulation previously infected or now preferentially infected upon Ki67 expression, which now enter the early phase of the viral replication cycle. Alternatively, Ki67 is actually recruited by, and thus a consequence of, large T expression.</p><p>(5) Neither the expression of large T-antigen nor of VP-1 was associated with the apoptosis-associated marker caspase-3, indicating that virus-mediated cell loss in PVAN was due to cytopathic replication and cell lysis and not due to apoptosis. Therefore, necrosis with the corresponding inflammatory response seems to be a primary cytopathologic effect. It is not clear whether T-antigen expression <italic>in vivo</italic> is sufficient to mediate anti-apoptotic effects. The negative staining results with bcl-2 suggest that the lack of apoptosis might not be due to over-expression of bcl-2 that is seen in certain malignancies.</p><p>In summary, the data from our group of selected patients show that, also in human renal transplants with ongoing PVAN, a clear distinction between early and late phase BKV infection can be made according to the expression of large T-antigen or VP1 protein. Virus-dependent effects appear to be mediated by T-antigen inhibiting p53 and thereby uncoupling the cell cycle. Nuclear enhancement goes hand in hand with the progression of the infectious cycle. Finally, virus-dependent cell death of tubular epithelial cells is necrosis and not apoptosis. Accordingly, we assume that in the inflammatory setting of PVAN, similar BKV mechanisms are operative as in certain <italic>in vitro</italic> systems.</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
