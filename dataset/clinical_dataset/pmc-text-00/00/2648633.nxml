It is known that they can inhibit cyclooxygenases, and some studies have shown that they can induce apoptosis. Our objective in this study was to investigate the mechanism by which aspirin exerts its apoptosis effects in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. The effect of aspirin on the gene expression was studied by differential mRNA display RT-PCR. Among the isolated genes, mu-type calpain gene was upregulated by aspirin treatment. To examine whether calpain mediates the antitumor effects, HeLa cells were stably transfected with the mammalian expression vector pCR3.1 containing mu-type calpain cDNA (pCRCAL/HeLa), and tumor formations were measured in nude mice. When tumor burden was measured by day 49, HeLa cells and pCR/HeLa cells (vector control) produced tumors of 2126 mm<sup>3</sup> and 1638 mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively, while pCRCAL/HeLa cells produced markedly smaller tumor of 434 mm<sup>3</sup> in volume. The caspase-3 activity was markedly elevated in pCRCAL/HeLa cells. The increased activity levels of caspase-3 in pCRCAL/HeLa cells, in parallel with the decreased tumor formation, suggest a correlation between caspase-3 activity and calpain protein. Therefore, we conclude that aspirin-induced calpain mediates an antitumor effect via caspase-3 in cervical cancer cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="section" id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Aspirinand other agents characterized as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)are designed primarily to decrease pain and inflammation. The molecular basisfor actions of NSAIDs is believed to be their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase(COX) activity and block the production of prostaglandins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Among NSAIDs, aspirin andsulindac can prevent the development of colon cancer and act as ananti-inflammatory agent by their inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Cancerof the uterine cervix is the second leading cause of death from cancer in womenworldwide and also the most prevalent gynecological malignancy in Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We investigatedwhether aspirin induced apoptosis in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. Toinvestigate the mechanism by which aspirin exerts its apoptosis effects, theeffect of aspirin on the gene expression was studied by differential mRNAdisplay RT-PCR (DD RT-PCR). Employing DD RT-PCR methods, we identified aspirin-responsivegene and mu-type calpain, which was confirmed byreal-time quantitative PCR.</p><p>Calpainis known to possess the proteoglycanase activity in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Calpain is ubiquitousfamily of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neutral cysteine proteases. The twoisoforms are classified according to their Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirements: mu-typecalpain and m-type calpain require micromolar and millimolar concentrations ofCa<sup>2+</sup> for activation, respectively. Growing evidence suggested thatcalpain may play a central role in the execution of apoptosis via modulation ofcaspase-3 activity in  glucocorticoid-treated and irradiatedthymocytes, neuronal cells exposed to UV, or MCF-7 breast cancer cells treatedwith <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-lapachone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Furtherprogress in cancer prevention would depend on understanding the mechanismsthrough which aspirin exertsmolecular action. However, the molecular mechanisms through which aspirin alters colonic tumorigenesis are unknown. In thisreport, we describe a potential mechanism by which aspirin induces apoptosis inhuman cervical cancer cells. To examine whether mu-type calpainmediates antitumor effects in HeLa cells, HeLa cells were stably transfectedwith mu-type calpain cDNA. Tumor formation andcaspase-3 activity of stably transfected cells were measured in nude mice. Inthis paper, we suggest that aspirin has an antitumor effect via the expressionof mu-type calpain gene in cervical cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

Apoptosis Analysis</title><p>Humancervical cancer cells, HeLa, were plated in a 24-well plate at a density of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well and treated with various doses of aspirin. To detect an apoptoticbody, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 dye and assessed for morphologicalsigns of apoptosis. The proportion of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M wasdetermined by flow cytometric analysis of DNA content (Becton Dickinson, Peterson, NJ, USA). Cell suspension was stained with propidium iodide. DNA histograms were analyzedusing CELL QUEST software to evaluate cell cycle compartments.</p></sec><sec id="subsec2.2"><title>2.2. Differential mRNA Display RT-PCR and Cloning</title><p>TotalRNA was extracted from cells with TRizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif, USA), following the protocol that wasprovided. Cell monolayers were washed with PBS, and 1 mL of TRizol/10<sup>6</sup> cells with 4 units of RNase inhibitor were added. For each sample, 2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g ofRNA were treated with DNase l (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes to remove contaminating DNA. One-base-anchoredoligo-dT primers were used to reverse transcribed total RNA into first-strandcDNA, which were amplified subsequently by PCR using the arbitrary upstreamprimers.

Apoptosis in Aspirin-Treated HeLa Cells</title><p>Weperformed DNA synthesis assay to study the effects of aspirin on HeLa cells. HeLa cells were treated in 1, 2, or 3 mM aspirin. Aspirin inhibited growth of cervicalcancer cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (data not shown). HeLa cells were then assessed for apoptosis. Aspirin-induced morphologicalchanges were evident in a concentration-dependent manner (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Cellstreated with aspirin became sparse, long squared, and detached from the dishes. Cell number was also decreased. Apoptotic bodies (indicated by white arrows in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were shown after aspirin treatment. To show apoptosis in the cellstreated with aspirin, flow cytometry analysis was performed. The population ofsub-G1 phase was changed from 1.2 to 18.9% in cells treated with 1 mM aspirin for48 hours. That of sub-G1 phase at 2 and 3 mM was in the similar range.</p></sec><sec id="subsec3.2"><title>3.2. Identification of Calpain Gene in Aspirin-Treated HeLaCells</title><p>AfterHeLa cells were treated with aspirin for 48 hours, we performed differential displayRT-PCR and selected differentially expressed genes, which was expressed withabsolute difference between control and aspirin-treated cells. The genes wereidentified with DNA sequencing. One of the upregulated genes is mu-typecalpain. Expression of calpain mRNA was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Calpain gene was highly expressed in aspirin-treated HeLa cells in aconcentration-dependent manner. Calpain gene was upregulated by 4.4, 6, and 8.8folds in the 1, 2, and 3 mM aspirin-treated HeLa cells, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="subsec3.3"><title>3.3. Tumorigenicity of Calpain Gene Product</title><p>We havecloned mu-type calpain cDNA into pCR3.1vector. The vector pCR or recombinant pCRCAL was stably transfected into HeLacells (pCR/HeLa cell or pCRCAL/HeLa cell). To assess whether change of cellbiology was caused after gene transfection, we measured cell proliferation. pCRCAL/HeLa cells appeared to have a markedly different growth pattern comparedwith HeLa cells and pCR/HeLa cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>). To establish arelationship between calpain and caspase-3, caspase-3 activities were measured. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>, caspase-3 activity was elevated in pCRCAL/HeLa cells. The markedly increased activity levels of caspase-3 in pCRCAL/HeLa cellssuggest a correlation of caspase-3 activity and calpain protein. In investigationof calpain role in the tumorigenicity, we evaluated tumor progression in nudemice. 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> stably transfected cells were subcutaneouslyinjected into the flank of the mouse. When tumor burden was measured by day 49,HeLa cells and pCR/HeLa cells produced tumors of 2126 &#x000b1; 163 mm<sup>3</sup> and 1638 &#x000b1; 213 mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively,  while pCRCAL/HeLa cells producedmarkedly small tumor of 434 &#x000b1; 206 mm<sup>3</sup> in volume (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)</xref>). Theexperiment was repeated three times with similar results. Tumor growth was reducedby calpain gene expression.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Wereport that aspirin inhibited the proliferation of cervical adenocarcinomacells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This agrees with other studiesshowing that aspirin inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Aspirin has antitumoreffects in the colon through induction of quiescence and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Apoptosis was shown tobe responsible for the cell growth inhibitory effects of aspirin in HT29 humancolon carcinoma cells. Our morphological observation of nuclear condensation afteraspirin treatment suggests that aspirin increases apoptosis in cervical cancercells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These results demonstrate that aspirin is an effectiveantitumor drug that induces apoptosis in cervical cancer cells.</p><p>A few molecularmechanisms of aspirin have been proposed. One of these mechanisms isCOX-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It iswell known that activation of p53 expression is involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this study, we haveshown that aspirin induces the calpain gene and calpain gene activationinhibits the tumor formation. These results support the previous findings thataspirin induces apoptosis by the regulation of bcl-2 and caspase-3 in humancervical cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore,aspirin might play roles in the inhibition of tumor formation throughactivation of calpain gene.</p><p>Calpainis a calcium-dependent cysteine protease that is implicated in calcium-dependentcell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Calpainplays an essential role in apoptotic commitment by cleaving Bax and generatingthe Bax/p18 fragment, which in turn mediates cytochrome c release and initiatesthe apoptotic execution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Calpain activationplays a critical role in cancer cell adhesion and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; and calpain could berelated to a therapeutic strategy targeting multiple disease states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In our experiments,caspase-3 activity was increased in the calpain-transfected HeLa cells,suggesting a correlation of calpain and caspase-3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>). Theinvolvement of caspase-3 in the calpain action is in agreement with the resultsin the photoreceptor cell, where calpain executes apoptosis via modulation ofcaspase-3 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Accompanying theincreased caspase-3 activity, tumor growth was reduced by calpain gene expression,leading to the role of calpain as an apoptosis mediator (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)</xref>). Fushimiet al. have analyzed calpain release from cultured chondrocytes stimulated by aproinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> (TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The effects of NSAIDson calpain release were also examined. However, their results were in contrastto our expectation. NSAIDs examined (aspirin, loxoprofen-SRS, diclofenacsodium, indomethacin, and NS398) potently inhibited TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-induced release of calpain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, theyshowed that PGE<sub>2</sub> alone failed to stimulate, but it significantly augmentedthe release of calpain in the presence of 1 ng/mL TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in HCS-2/8 cells. Moreover, inhibition ofcalpain release by an NSAID, loxoprofen-SRS, was significantly reversed by 100 nM PGE<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, further studies are necessary to clarify the relationshipimplicated in the aspirin treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec5"><title>5.
