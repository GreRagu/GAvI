Previous work using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model system and analysis of specific mutations in human rhodopsin have uncovered a connection between rhodopsin endocytosis and retinal degeneration. In these mutants, rhodopsin and its regulatory protein arrestin form stable complexes, and endocytosis of these complexes causes photoreceptor cell death. In this study we show that the internalized rhodopsin is not degraded in the lysosome but instead accumulates in the late endosomes. Using mutants that are defective in late endosome to lysosome trafficking, we were able to show that rhodopsin accumulates in endosomal compartments in these mutants and leads to light-dependent retinal degeneration. Moreover, we also show that in dying photoreceptors the internalized rhodopsin is not degraded but instead shows characteristics of insoluble proteins. Together these data implicate buildup of rhodopsin in the late endosomal system as a novel trigger of death of photoreceptor neurons.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Irreversible loss of photoreceptor cells has been attributed as a cause of blindness in many retinal degenerative disorders. One such group of disorders is retinitis pigmentosa, which affects 1 in 3,000 individuals. Over 100 mutations in the light-sensing molecule rhodopsin have been identified in patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. These mutations affect rhodopsin transport to the outer segments of rod photoreceptor cells, rhodopsin folding, and rhodopsin endocytosis. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptors, endocytosis of a large amount of rhodopsin at a rapid rate results in cell death. To further understand the role of endocytosis in triggering cell death, we used previously characterized mutants in which lysosomal degradation is compromised. We show that retinal degeneration can also be induced in these genetic backgrounds after rhodopsin is endocytosed, suggesting that failure to degrade internalized rhodopsin in a timely manner triggers cell death of photoreceptor neurons. We also present direct cellular biological evidence of rhodopsin accumulation in the cell bodies of photoreceptors, only in mutant backgrounds that undergo retinal degeneration. We could rescue the degeneration by preventing rhodopsin endocytosis and accumulation. Thus, our results indicate the vital role of lysosomal turnover of rhodopsin in maintaining photoreceptor viability.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inherited retinal degenerative disorders in humans exhibit heterogeneity in their underlying causes and clinical outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Sullivan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Diverse causes have been attributed, including disruption of genes that are involved in phototransduction, biosynthesis and folding of the rhodopsin molecule, and the structural support of the retina. However, a clear understanding of the mechanism of photoreceptor cell death has yet to be worked out. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> phototransduction pathway, mediated by the major rhodopsin (Rh1), has served as a model system for studying retinal degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Hardie1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Zuker1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Perturbation of endocytic regulation of Rh1 has deleterious effects on photoreceptor cell physiology. This has been well documented for <italic>Drosophila norpA</italic> mutants. In <italic>norpA</italic> flies, persistent complexes between rhodopsin and arrestin are formed due to a block in light-triggered Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent phosphorylation of Arr2. Arr2 then recruits the endocytic machinery triggering massive internalization of Rh1, resulting in light-dependent retinal degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Alloway1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Orem2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Pathogenic endocytosis of Rh1 is also demonstrated in other phototransduction mutants of <italic>Drosophila</italic> such as <italic>retinal degeneration C (rdgC)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Kiselev1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>arrestin1 (arr1)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Satoh1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, formation of toxic Rhodopsin-Arrestin complexes is also reported for mutants of human rhodopsin associated with severe forms of Autosomal Dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa (ADRP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Chen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Chuang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, mutations at Arg135 are associated with severe forms of retinitis pigmentosa and exhibit a high affinity for arrestin, undergo endocytosis, and display endosomal abnormalities. These instances underscore the importance of studying Rh1 endocytosis and its relation to the photoreceptor health.</p><p>Earlier work has indicated that Rh1 internalization plays a crucial role in <italic>norpA</italic> and <italic>rdgC</italic>-mediated photoreceptor cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Kiselev1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Alloway2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Orem3">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. However the role that is played by downstream endocytic trafficking, if any, has not been addressed. Here, we investigate the effect of post-endocytic modulation of Rh1 trafficking in influencing retinal degeneration in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We show that the granule group mutants that have impaired lysosomal delivery underwent light-dependent retinal degeneration in an otherwise wild type background. In <italic>norpA</italic> as well as granule group mutants, Rh1 accumulated in the Rab7-positive late endosomes as persistent vesicles. Preventing Rh1 accumulation by vitamin A deprivation (which reduces the total Rh1 amount) or by using <italic>Rh1&#x00394;356</italic> (an Rh1-variant that cannot be endocytosed) rescued photoreceptor cell death in granule group mutants. We also observe that, in <italic>norpA</italic>, the internalized Rh1 is not degraded. Taken together, our results indicate the vital role of lysosomal turnover of Rh1 in maintaining photoreceptor viability.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Functional Late Endosomal System Is Essential for Photoreceptor Cell Viability after Rh1 Internalization</title><p>Previous work on <italic>Drosophila norpA</italic> and <italic>rdgC</italic> mutants has revealed that massive endocytosis of Rh1 following light-exposure is the underlying cause of photoreceptor cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Kiselev1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Alloway2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

We therefore, explored the fate of Rh1 after it is delivered to the late endosomes by carrying out pulse-chase experiments. After internalization, Rh1 persists in the endosomes for approximately 13 hours in wild type flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Satoh2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and data not shown). We exposed flies for 2 days of continuous light to ensure that rate of Rh1 internalization reaches a maximum level. We then shifted the light-treated flies to complete darkness for 13 hours to allow any internalized Rh1 to traffic through the endosomal system while preventing any new endocytosis. This procedure allows us to discern any changes in Rh1 trafficking past the late endosomal stage.</p><p>In wild type flies that are subjected to the light/dark treatment as described above Rh1 was found at the base of the rhabdomere and the cytoplasm is mostly devoid of any Rh1-positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000377-g004">Figure 4</xref>). There were a few Rh1/Rab7-double positive vesicles found as in dark-raised flies. Some Rh1-positive, Rab7-negative vesicles were also observed (data not shown). Thus, in the absence of any additional endocytosis, all the internalized Rh1 completely exits Rab7-positive late endosomes in 13 hours in wild type flies. On the contrary in <italic>norpA</italic> flies subjected to similar light treatment, Rh1-positive vesicles showed a very different behavior. In these flies some Rh1 immunoreactivity reappeared in the rhabdomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000377-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, Rh1-positive vesicles persisted in the cytoplasm. These vesicles took an amorphous shape uncharacteristic of the Rh1 vesicles in light-treated flies. Moreover, the persistent Rh1 vesicles stained positive for Rab7, indicating their late endosomal nature.

In wild type photoreceptors, transient interaction of the major arrestin (Arr2) with Rh1 results in the deactivation of photoresponse.

Here we demonstrate that rapid endocytosis of Rh1 in <italic>norpA</italic> leads to its accumulation in the late endosomes. It has been previously reported that Rh1 is a very abundant protein in the outer photoreceptor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-OTousa1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Zuker2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on our current data we hypothesize that sudden endocytosis of a majority of Rh1 such that the lysosomal system is saturated, results in its accumulation in the late endosomes. We can induce Rh1 accumulation by causing slower lysosomal turnover, as in the granule group mutants, and this simulates gradual, light-dependent retinal degeneration in <italic>norpA</italic>. Reducing endocytosis prevents Rh1 buildup and rescues retinal degeneration. Similarly, preventing Rh1 accumulation in granule group mutants also rescues photoreceptor cell death. These data are consistent with a model that photoreceptor cell death is induced by the accumulation of Rh1 in the endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000377-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Our results also indicate that Rh1 is not degraded in <italic>norpA</italic>; instead it becomes insoluble and undetectable on western blots, most likely due to formation of high-molecular weight aggregates.</p><fig id="pgen-1000377-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000377.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>A model for light-dependent retinal degeneration.</title><p>In wild type flies, Rh1 is endocytosed upon light-activation. The endocytosed Rh1 undergoes regular lysosomal turnover. In <italic>norpA</italic> flies, a large number of stable Rhodopsin-Arrestin complexes are formed which undergo rapid endocytosis. Massive endocytosis of Rhodopsin overwhelms the endocytic machinery and this rhodopsin fails to undergo degradation by the lysosomes and hence accumulates in the late endosomes. Endosomal accumulation of Rhodopsin triggers cell death by unknown mechanisms. This condition is simulated in granule group mutants that are defective in lysosomal delivery of endocytosed cargo. In these mutants, Rh1 internalization is similar to that in wild type but Rh1 accumulates in late endosomes as a result of defective trafficking. This accumulation of Rhodopsin also leads to photoreceptor cell death.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000377.g006"/></fig><p>The granule group mutants used in this study are mild loss-of-function alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Nickla1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and are viable.

Since null alleles of the granule group genes result in lethality, our analysis was restricted only to the available viable alleles of these genes. Our analysis of multiple genes affecting late endosomal/lysosome trafficking rules out the light-dependent degeneration as an artifact. Despite their impact on endocytosis, we believe that the photoreceptor cell death observed in the granule group mutants is specifically due to Rh1 accumulation and not because of trafficking impairment of other cargo molecules. These mutants do not display any retinal degeneration in continuous darkness&#x02014;a condition in which Rh1 endocytosis is minimal. Absence of any photoreceptor degeneration in darkness discounts the idea that cell death is due to an effect on &#x0201c;housekeeping&#x0201d; endocytosis in these mutants. We also demonstrate that the photoreceptor death is rescued when the C-terminal region of Rh1 is deleted. This prevents endocytosis specifically of Rh1 and should not affect any other cellular process. Our results of vitamin A deprivation experiments also rule out the possibility of any pleiotropic effects of these mutations as the cause of retinal degeneration. Vitamin A is solely required for visual pigment biosynthesis and does not play any role in cellular physiology in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Harris1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Rescue of light-dependent retinal degeneration of granule group mutants by vitamin A deprivation suggests that reduction of Rh1 protein level is sufficient to prevent retinal cell death.</p><p>It is also possible that a second molecule capable of triggering a pro-cell death pathway from endosomes is internalized with Rh1. Thus preventing endocytosis of Rh1 or its accumulation may prevent cell death signaling by this molecule.

Similarly, we have not been able to detect ubiquitylation of Rh1 (P.J. Dolph, unpublished data). Currently we cannot elucidate the identity (Rh1 or other protein) of the molecule that triggers cell death. Regardless of the identity of the pro-death molecule, based on our data we conclude that timely degradation of Rh1 by fully functional lysosomal machinery is essential for maintaining photoreceptor viability.</p><p>Our finding, that failure to clear accumulated Rh1 causes cell death, has relevance to human disease. Autosomal Dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa (ADRP) is a retinal degenerative disorder and is a common cause of blindness affecting one in 3000 people (RetNet, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/Retnet/">http://www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/Retnet/</ext-link>). Mutations in the human rhodopsin that affect its folding, trafficking and activity are the most commonly encountered causes of retinal degeneration in afflicted patients. Missense mutations in the opsin gene affecting the R135 and K296 residues of the protein product cause ADRP and result in accumulation of Rhodopsin-Arrestin complexes in the photoreceptor cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Chen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Chuang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The R135 mutant rhodopsin is noted to form stable complex with arrestin and undergo endocytosis resulting in aberrant endocytic vesicles in HEK cell culture system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Chuang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, the K296E rhodopsin is observed to bind the visual arrestin with high affinity. This abnormal interaction is demonstrated to have pathological consequences in the retina. Besides this, the stable rhodopsin and arrestin complexes are shown to mislocalize and accumulate in the inner segments of rod photoreceptors of the mouse model of ADRP. Thus the accumulation of rhodopsin might trigger cell death by a similar mechanism as in <italic>Drosophila norpA</italic> and granule group mutants.</p><p>In this work, using the anti-Rh1 antibody, we observe that Rh1 staining at the base of the rhabdomeres in a crescent-shaped pattern in adult flies. Similar results with adult flies have been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Satoh1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Kumar1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Chang1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. This is in contrast to earlier reports where Rh1 staining was uniformly present in the entire rhabdomere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Orem1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Orem2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Orem3">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The different results could be attributed to the differences in immunolocalization methods. Previous studies have used cryosectioning followed by immunostaining, while this study utilizes whole-mount immunostaining to localize Rh1. It is possible that the crescent-shaped staining of Rh1 in whole-mount samples is observed due to inaccessibility to rhabdomeric Rh1 as a result of highly organized and densely packed microvillar structure in adult fly eyes. The uniform distribution of GFP-tagged Rh1 throughout the rhabdomere in whole-mounted retinas supports this explanation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000377.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Regardless of the observed differences in the rhabdomeric Rh1 staining patterns, our ability to detect persistent Rh1-positive vesicles in the photoreceptor cell body leads us to propose that cytoplasmic accumulation of Rh1 in certain genetic backgrounds results in their light-dependent retinal degeneration. We also observe that Rh1 immunoreactivity is lost as a function of light-exposure on the western-blots in <italic>norpA</italic> flies. However, slot-blot analysis reveals that Rh1 persists in light-exposed <italic>norpA</italic> flies. The observed differences in the results obtained by two techniques can be attributed to the change in protein solubility, most likely due to protein aggregation and formation of high molecular weight protein complex. We demonstrate that Rh1 in <italic>norpA</italic> accumulates in late endosomes. Late endosomes are acidic compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Gruenberg1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and Rh1 aggregates under acidic conditions (P. J. Dolph, unpublished). We speculate that under extremely high concentration and acidic pH, such as those presented in <italic>norpA</italic>, Rh1 can aggregate and form a high molecular weight complex. This complex fails to traverse the gel matrix in the SDS-PAGE and hence remains undetectable on the western-blot while it can be easily detected by slot-blot analysis. A single base-substitution at the codon position 23 in the human opsin gene (P23H) is the most common cause of ADRP in American patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Dryja1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. P23H rhodopsin is extremely prone to aggregation and forms high-molecular weight complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Illing1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Saliba1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

This bears remarkable resemblance with some neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Spinocerebellar ataxias and Prion diseases, where protein misfolding, aggregation and cytoplasmic accumulation are the implicated causes of cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Forman1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been demonstrated that late endosomal accumulation of cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Maxfield1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, prion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Arnold1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> and amyloid &#x003b2;-protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> is associated with Niemann-Pick type C disease, Scrapie and Alzheimer's Disease respectively. Therefore it is tempting to speculate that protein accumulation results in neuronal death by utilizing similar pathways in <italic>norpA</italic> and neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>Our results raise one intriguing question. That is, how can vesicular accumulation of Rh1 elicit pro-cell death signaling?

But the precise mechanisms regulating the pro-cell death signaling pathways and their interconnection with endocytosis is not well understood. Conventional developmental apoptosis involving caspase-activation plays a marginal role in <italic>norpA</italic> retinal degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Hsu1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is plausible that persistent cytoplasmic presence of Rh1 activates photoreceptor cell death by a similar mechanism. We speculate that a component innate to the endolysosomal system plays a crucial role in regulating the cell death signals emanating from the endosomes. Accumulation of Rh1 is sensed by this component, which can then engage the cell death machinery to execute cell death in the retina. Failure of proper protein degradation and resultant subsequent accumulation of proteins is a well-recognized cause of cell death in many neurodegenerative disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Taylor1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cross sections (1 &#x000b5;m) were cut using a Sorvall ultra microtome MT-1 (Sorvall, CT). The sections were stained with toluidine blue and borax and observed on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope using a 63X/1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Digital images were captured using a Optronics DEI-750 camera (Optronics) and MetaVue (Universal Imaging) software.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Antibodies and Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Anti-rab7 antibody was generated in rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals, PA) against the unique C-terminal 45 amino acids of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rab7 protein. This antibody recognized a single 27 kDa protein in homogenates prepared from wild type fly heads. To further confirm the specificity of this antibody, we expressed GFP-Rab7 and GFP-Rab5 fusion proteins in separate fly lines using the GMR-Gal4/UAS system. This antibody recognized the GFP-Rab7 fusion protein but did not recognize the GFP-Rab5 protein in fly head homogenates when assayed by western blot analysis. Other reported antibodies for the late endosome-specific proteins of <italic>Drosophila,</italic> namely Anti-Dor, Anti-Hook and Anti-LBPA yield inconsitent or no signal in photoreceptors (Anti-Dor; this study) and (Anti-Hook and Anti-LBPA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Satoh2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>).

For dissections in darkness, eyes from dark-adapted flies were dissected under safelight illumination using 1A and GBX-2 filters (Kodak). Illumination with these lights did not elicit any ERG response. Isolated retinas were incubated in diluted primary antiserum overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The antibodies were diluted in 1X PBS&#x0002b;0.3&#x00025; Triton X-100 (PBX)&#x0002b;10&#x00025; Fetal Calf Serum (FCS). After 3 washes with PBX for 5 minutes each, the tissue was incubated in secondary antibodies diluted in PBX&#x0002b;FCS for 12&#x02013;14 hours at 4&#x000b0;C. After two brief washes with PBX at room temperature and a prolonged, overnight wash at 4&#x000b0;C, the eyes were rinsed with 1X PBS for 3 times. The eyes were mounted in 50&#x00025; Glycerol/1 X PBS/0.5&#x00025; n-Propyl Gallate and viewed over Leica TCS SP confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). The primary antibodies were anti-Rh1 (1:50) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa city, IA), anti-Rab7 (1:100) (this study). For visualizing rhabdomeres, F-actin was stained using Rhodamine- or Alexa-568-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) (5 U/mL) added to the diluted primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse or anti-rabbit labeled with Alexa-488 or Alexa-647 (1:300) (Molecular Probes), Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse (1:200) and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:200) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA).</p><p>The captured images were processed with NIH ImageJ and/or Adobe Photoshop. Whenever possible, the images were made colorblind-compatible. The image processing conformed to the guidelines laid down by Rossner and Yamada <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000377-Rossner1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. For whole-mount immunostaining, retinas from a minimum of five flies were isolated and processed as above. For quantifying Rh1 vesicles, cytoplasmic spherical structures staining positive for Rh1 were counted in 140&#x02013;150 ommatidia per experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Biochemistry</title><p>Fly heads were homogenized in Laemmli 1X SDS loading buffer (SDSLB).

The membrane was incubated in 0.2 N sodium hydroxide for 30 minutes and washed three times with 1X PBS&#x0002b;0.1 &#x00025; Tween-20. Blocking and antibody incubations were carried out as in western analysis. The blots were subjected to densitometry analysis using the LabWorks Imaging and Analysis software (UVP, Inc., Upland, CA). The intensity of Rh1 band for a particular time period (t) was divided by the intensity of Rh1 band corresponding to lysates prepared from dark-adapted (Rh1<sub>0</sub>) flies to arrive at the Rh1<sub>t</sub>/Rh1<sub>0</sub> value. The Rh1<sub>t</sub>/Rh1<sub>0</sub> values from three independent experiments were used for analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000377.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Rhodopsin immunostaining is detected at the base of the rhabdomere.
