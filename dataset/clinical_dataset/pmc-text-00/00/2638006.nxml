A fundamental concept is the use of gene expression as a &#x0201c;common currency&#x0201d; that links the results of <italic>in vitro</italic> controlled experiments to <italic>in vivo</italic> observational human studies. Many studies &#x02013; in cancer and other diseases &#x02013; have shown promise in using <italic>in vitro</italic> cell manipulations to improve understanding of <italic>in vivo</italic> biology, but experiments often simply fail to reflect the enormous phenotypic variation seen in human diseases. We address this with a framework and methods to dissect, enhance and extend the <italic>in vivo</italic> utility of <italic>in vitro</italic> derived gene expression signatures. From an experimentally defined gene expression signature we use statistical factor analysis to generate <italic>multiple</italic> quantitative factors in human cancer gene expression data. These factors retain their relationship to the original, one-dimensional <italic>in vitro</italic> signature but better describe the diversity of <italic>in vivo</italic> biology. In a breast cancer analysis, we show that factors can reflect fundamentally different biological processes linked to molecular and clinical features of human cancers, and that in combination they can improve prediction of clinical outcomes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microarray technology allows the capture of diverse aspects of genetic, environmental, oncogenic and other factors as reflected in global mRNA expression and opens the possibility of personalizing treatment of disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Nevins1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Pittman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Alternatively, other studies have taken a &#x0201c;bottom-up&#x0201d; approach to determine the change of gene expression caused by specific manipulations of cultured cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. In these studies gene expression serves as a common phenotype to recognize similar features in human cancers <italic>in vivo</italic> and to provide a direct linkage between the known biological perturbation and the clinical contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Chen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Lamb1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Though many such studies have shown promise in using <italic>in vitro</italic> cell manipulations to understand <italic>in vivo</italic> biology, this approach cannot fully reflect the enormous phenotypic variation seen in human cancers. From such studies, one can derive <italic>signatures</italic>. These we define to be lists of genes that are differentially expressed along with their associated levels of differential expression (which we call weights). However, there is nearly always a poor match between these signatures and expression patterns of the same genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, a conceptual framework is needed to further dissect, enhance and extend the <italic>in vivo</italic> utility of the <italic>in vitro</italic> derived signature. Here, we present a technique for achieving this purpose. We propose deriving multiple factors, based on human cancer gene expression studies, from an experimentally defined signature. These derived factors will retain their relationship to the original signature but represent distinct biological processes. Importantly, we show that different derived factors can be combined to provide much better predictive values for the clinical outcomes. Different factors also reflect different biological processes and are linked to various aspects of molecular and clinical features of human cancers.</p><p>There are a number of possible approaches to this problem. One popular approach has been to compare the identities of the differentially expressed probes to databases of pre-defined pathways. Descriptions of such approaches can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Tomlins1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Subramanian1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. While these approaches are appealing for their interpretability, they rely on the appropriately pre-defined pathways rather than the structure of the data under study. Alternatively, one may simply define the signature activity level for a sample as the weighted average of <italic>in vivo</italic> expression levels (where the genes over which to compute the weights and the weights themselves are drawn from the original signature). Although some studies have shown the power of this concept, it is clear that one can not hope to capture the heterogeneity of <italic>in vivo</italic> biology from the one-dimensional controlled biological response the <italic>in vitro</italic> signature reflects.</p><p>The inherent heterogeneity of environment and cell type in tissue samples means that the genes in a signature may potentially involve many additional activities not evident <italic>in vitro</italic>. Further, experiments on cloned cell lines of a single cell type grown under tightly controlled conditions for a fixed (and relatively short) length of time may contrast starkly with clinical samples extracted from living organisms containing multiple cell types that have been in a dynamic environment for months or years. There is no clearly &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d; method for taking what is learned by microarray experiment in culture and applying it to assess pathway activity in tissue samples. Some genes may be poorer representatives of pathway activity <italic>in vivo</italic> because they are more likely to be involved in other pathways, because they react to environmental conditions that are not present <italic>in vitro</italic>, or for a myriad of other reasons. It is, therefore, important to provide a statistical and conceptual framework which can allow us to use the <italic>in vivo</italic> expression data to further dissect, refine and enhance the <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived gene signatures.</p><p><italic>Signature Factor Profiling Analysis</italic> (SFPA), based on sparse statistical factor models, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-West2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> is a framework for mapping <italic>in vitro</italic> signatures to a collection of <italic>in vivo</italic> factors. While this sounds similar to hierarchical clustering (which has become the default method for this type of problem), there are important distinctions. First, while hierarchical clustering can be used to break a set of samples into groups, within which expression patterns are similar in some way, it does not quantify that similarity. Second, hierarchical clustering requires that each observation (gene) be a member of just one cluster. This precludes assigning clusters to biological pathways, because many combinations of pathway activity are possible. Lastly, because the factors are generated within a statistical model, it is possible to identify the levels of activity in each of the factors on a newly measured sample without redoing the statistical analysis. While there are techniques other than hierarchical clustering which address some of these issues, for example soft-clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Kumar1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and k-means clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-MacQueen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, our algorithm addresses them all within a single coherent statistical framework.

We demonstrate that multiple factors arising in a breast cancer context remain representative of the individual microenvironmental pathway responses from which they are derived. Furthermore, these factors differentiate key biological phenotypes in breast cancer, are able to improve clinical predictions across multiple cancer data sets, and retain their predictive ability even when applied to samples taken at vastly different times or at different study centers.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Context, Data and Analysis Strategy</title><p>We begin with five signatures defined by the transcriptional responses of cultured human mammary breast epithelial cells to five microenvironmental perturbations: hypoxia, lactic acidosis, hypoxia plus lactic acidosis, lactosis, and acidosis. Each of these is seen in human cancers and carries prognostic information with respect to clinical outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Chen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The signatures represent changes in expression of genes between a set of control observations and cells grown in the presence of lactic acidosis (25 mM lactic acid, pH 6.7), hypoxia (2&#x00025; O2), lactic acid plus hypoxia, lactosis (25 mM sodium lactate, neutral pH), and acidosis (pH 6.7 without lactate). Expression assays used Affymetrix U133&#x0002b; 2.0 microarrays and signatures reflecting each of the microenvironmental factors have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Chen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Chen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, hypoxia, lactic acidosis and acidosis have strong prognostic significance in several studies of breast cancers. Our aim here is to explore the various components of the original gene signatures to evaluate the opportunity for further enhancing their prognostic values and dissecting them into distinct biological pathway-relevant factors with clinical relevance.</p><p>We use Bayesian Factor Regression Modeling (BFRM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Wang1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> to define and estimate factors based on a given signature. This begins with a small collection of genes that are highly responsive to the original intervention (highly differentially expressed between control and experimental groups in cell culture) and then iteratively refines the gene set, based on co-expression in an in vivo data set, in the context of a statistical factor analysis. First, common patterns of expression (factors) are discovered within the subset of genes currently under consideration. Next, the association between these factors and the full set of genes on the array allows us to identify additional genes to be included in a revision of the factor analysis. The rationale for this is that, while evaluating factors underlying the initial selected signature genes allows us to elucidate <italic>in vivo</italic> variability that is not present <italic>in vitro</italic>, adding genes from outside the original signature can improve the characterization of these factors while providing linkages to other relevant pathways. Running SFPA on each of the five signatures independently, we obtain 11 hypoxia factors, 10 lactic acidosis factors, 20 hypoxia plus lactic acidosis factors, 17 lactosis factors and 9 acidosis factors. SFPA stops discovering factors once most of the variability in the original gene set has been explained.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Signature-Factor Relationships</title><p>We will focus, for now, on the ten lactic acidosis factors. Examining the genes in each of the factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004523-g001">Figure 1a</xref>) shows that all factors have representatives from the original signature in addition to genes added during the process of fitting the factor model. It is important to be sure that in the discovery of these ten factors, we have not lost our original signature. We check this by regressing the 10 sets of derived factor scores on the lactic acidosis signature scores. (Calculation of a signature score is described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section.) Witin a single multivariate regression model, we find that 7 of the 10 are significant at the .01 level, and that when we eliminate the remaining three factors from the multivariate regression, those seven remain significant. Thus, at least seven of the factors show a significant association to the original signature.</p><fig id="pone-0004523-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004523.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Factor associations.</title><p>(a) Connections between genes and the 10 lactic acidosis factors in the statistical factor analysis of the breast cancer data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Miller1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0004523.e001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> for this regression is high (.74), but it is possible these ten factors might be able to explain many different signatures. In order to show that this is not a spurious association, we test the hypothesis that this <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0004523.e002.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> level is independent of which genes are assigned which weights. We re-sampled the weights 10,000 times, each time regressing the signature score vector computed from these weights on the 10 lactic acidosis factors and computing an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0004523.e003.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> value. Of the 10,000 values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0004523.e004.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> so computed under the null hypothesis, the maximum was .48 ensuring that the p-value &#x0226a;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>. If we approximate the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0004523.e005.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> values by a beta distribution (calculated by method of moments) we get a very close fit (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004523.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and estimate the p-value to be &#x02248;10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup>. Because only the list of highly differentially expressed genes from the lactic acidosis signature, and not the weights, are used in the factor discovery, and because the weights are critical for the computation of the lactic acidosis signature scores, the ability to recover signature scores from factors is strong evidence of the relationship between the two.</p><p>The three factors derived from the lactic acidosis signature that were not important in the prediction of signature scores may still represent activity relevant to the presence of lactic acid, but they are not strongly predictive of the original signature. They may also simply represent the activity of biological pathways that involve very large sets of genes, and are thus discovered from many different possible starting points. Nonetheless, they represent significant structure in expression of the expanded signature gene set in tumor data, and none of these factors would be detectable from studying the signature alone as a phenotype.</p><p>Factors can reflect distinct aspects of biological activity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004523-g001">Figure 1c</xref> shows which of the 67 factors (all factors discovered from each of the five starting signatures) have high correlation with the 10 lactic acidosis factors from the Miller breast data analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Miller1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Notice that no two of the lactic acidosis factors are highly correlated, thus these factors seem to describe distinct processes. Some of the 10 factors, such as lactic acidosis factor 8 for example, are highly correlated with multiple other factors, indicating that these factors have been identified from multiple initial signatures. Most, however, show low levels of pairwise correlation. Among the 67 factors, 40 principal components are required to account for 95&#x00025; of the observed variability (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004523.s002">figure S2</xref>) implying that a relatively high biological &#x0201c;dimension&#x0201d; underlies the 67 factors &#x02013; they reflect a diverse set of biological activities, and presumably pathways altered in the cellular responses to lactic acidosis within human breast tumors. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004523-g001">Figure 1a</xref> shows the connections between genes and the 10 lactic acidosis factors in the analysis. The genes include the initial selected signature genes and those added through the iterative enrichment analysis. The SFPA-derived factors retain a high percentage of genes that have been shown to exhibit a change in expression when cells are exposed to the presence of lactic acid <italic>in vitro</italic>, showing in another way that these factors still maintain their connection with the original signature. The cross-talk between factors, in terms of genes defining more than one factor, is also evident.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Factors Predict Molecular Features</title><p>SFPA-derived factors can represent distinct aspects of biological processes associated with clinical phenotypes.

Highly scored models for p53 involve the ER factor, the PgR specific factor, and one of either Hypoxia 1 or Lactic Acidosis 3. The correlation between these latter two factors is 99&#x00025;, so we label them collectively as the p53 specific factor.

The p53 factor is significantly bimodal, and the mild correlation one can see is due entirely to this bimodality, as tumor samples with high ER factor activity are more likely to be in the second mode of the p53 factor. We theorize that this bimodality is associated with a particular subtype of the p53 mutation. However, there is no evidence of multimodality in the ER factor, and the p53 specific factor predicts ER status poorly. Because of these differences, and because cell replication is a complex process, it is likely that these two factors are related to distinct features of cell development.</p><p>We stress that, if we restrain ourselves to considering the original <italic>in vitro</italic> lactic acidosis signature, we have no ability to fit or predict any of these biological phenotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004523-t003">Table 3</xref>). Additionally, these factors were generated entirely without regard to the ER status, PgR status, or p53 status of the samples. This is in contrast to a more typical design in which signatures associated with phenotypes are defined strictly based on genes with expression profiles that match those phenotypes (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Miller1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>). This type of design is plagued with difficulties that arise from the large number of genes, out of the tens of thousands on an array, with expression patterns that match any arbitrary phenotype. With SFPA, we search for genes that are expressed together without regard to phenotype, and we are therefore much less likely to be plagued by false discovery (as proven by our out of sample predictive accuracy).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0004523-t003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004523.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Phenotype Associations with Factors and Signature.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0004523-t003-3" xlink:href="pone.0004523.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0004523-t003-3"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">LA Factors</td><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">LA Signature</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P53 Mutant</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P53 Wild</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P53 Mutant</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P53 Wild</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;50&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;50&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">174</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">169</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ER&#x0002b;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ER&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ER&#x0002b;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ER&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;50&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">202</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">212</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;50&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PgR&#x0002b;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PgR&#x02212;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PgR&#x0002b;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PgR&#x02212;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;50&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">180</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">185</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;50&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt103"><label/><p>Cross tabulation for prediction of three pheontypes by lactic acidosis factors (left) and by the lactic acidosis signature (right).

Though the 67 factors are in no way specifically targeted at Tamoxifen, we do know they are associated with relevant biological pathways. From our 67 factors, we found that Lactic Acidosis 1 is predictive of Tamoxifen resistance. It differentiates metastasis-free survival in patients who received the drug and shows no predictive ability in patients who did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004523-g004">Figure 4b</xref>; the analysis underlying this followed the same approach as for survival discussed above). Because all of the patients who received Tamoxifen were ER positive, drug resistance associated with this factor must be independent of the antagonistic action of the drug on estrogen receptors. Since none of these data sets were used in the training of the factor model, the ability of these factors to distinguish resistance to Tamoxifen is remarkable and demonstrates that they are robust to the collection biases often seen in microarray experiments. We again used GATHER to study the ontology of the genes included in this factor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004523-t004">Table 4</xref>).

Since SFPA can utilize <italic>in vivo</italic> cancer gene expression to dissect the <italic>in vitro</italic>-generated gene signature, it offers the possibility of identifying tissue and organ-specific factors associated with the same gene signatures. This application has the potential to distinguish sub-pathways that are conserved across many tissue types from those that are organ-specific. To illustrate this point, we utilize the lung cancer data set published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Bild1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and the ovarian cancer data set from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Huang4">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

We performed SFPA analysis of the same lactic acidosis signature as a starting point for factor discovery from the lung and ovarian cancer data sets.</p><p>In the case of the lung cancer, the analysis discovered 20 factors associated with lactic acidosis. When we compared the expression levels of the 10 lactic acidosis factors in the breast cancer data with the 20 lactic acidosis factors discovered in the lung cancer data, we found that several factors are highly conserved, including the tamoxifen factor, the p53 specific factor, as well as factors 7 and 8. In contrast, the ER and PgR factors are only found in breast cancers. If we look specifically at standardized raw expression levels for the genes in the ER factor in the breast data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004523.s003">figure S3a</xref>) as compared to that for the lung data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004523.s003">figure S3b</xref>) we see that there is consistent variation in the breast data which is not present in the lung data. In contrast, the standardized raw expression for the conserved tamoxifen factor shows a coherent expression pattern in both breast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004523.s003">Figure S3c</xref>) and the lung cancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004523.s003">Figure S3d</xref>). Additionally, within this data set, our newly discovered factors also possess significant prognostic value, being able to distinguish between the two types of cancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004523.s004">Figure S4a</xref>) as well as distinguish between high and low risk patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004523.s004">Figure S4b</xref>). Similar observations are also present in ovarian cancer since the model averaged survival using the 8 lactic acidosis factors discovered in the ovarian cancer dataset can clearly differentiate high versus low acuity patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004523.s004">Figure S4c</xref>).

Here, we have exemplified a statistical approach to further improve the <italic>in vitro</italic> gene signatures based on the gene expression in <italic>in vivo</italic> cancer samples.

Such links are intriguing, and open questions regarding causation as well as questions about the biological associations of the remaining factors. However, regardless of links to known biology, this strategy and analysis seem to provide an advance in our ability to obtain consistent results across many different data sets collected at different times by different groups. This is a significant advance, as data collection inconsistencies are one of the main roadblocks to the use of microarrays in a clinical setting.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for the enhancement of the prognostic values achieved with SFPA. It is possible that certain genes or pathway components in the original gene signatures are simply noise or artifact due to their <italic>in vitro</italic> origins. These genes may offer no or even negative prognostic values for <italic>in vivo</italic> biology. By using SFPA to separate different components, it is possible to enhance the prognostic value by selecting only the relevant components or genes for predictive purposes. By so doing, it is also possible to examine the genes comprising those factors with strong links to clinical phenotypes which will lead to biological insights into this association.</p><p>Another opportunity this analysis raises is the ability to uncover the pathways which would be &#x0201c;hidden&#x0201d; in the <italic>in vitro</italic> signature. In our current study, factor one was not immediately recognizable as a clinically relevant list of genes, but the ability of this factor to predict patient resistance to Tamoxifen points to an important connection which would not have been possible to discern otherwise. This observation will lead to efforts in investigating the biological roles of this factor and how it is related to Tamoxifen treatment and cellular response to lactic acidosis. For example, it is well known that tumor hypoxia negatively impacts clinical outcomes, but the actual mechanism by which this occurs is complex and may include radiation resistance, increased tumor invasion, migration, increased survival and decreased drug sensitivities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Semenza1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Although these hypoxia-induced effects occur in cancer patients, many of these events cannot be replicated or modeled in any particular <italic>in vitro</italic> setting. It is possible to uncover these processes via of the use of SFPA for the cancer gene expression. In a similar fashion, it is unclear how lactic acidosis responses are linked to good prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004523-Chen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and SFPA will allow us to explore <italic>in vivo</italic> gene expression to dissect this response and develop testable biological hypotheses. Equally importantly, the mechanisms by which hypoxia and lactic acidosis link to different clinical outcomes may vary among different cancer types, and the use of SFPA can specifically pinpoint the relevant biological processes to target or intervene to modulate clinical courses of cancer patients.</p><p>Tremendous resources continue to be expended on the discovery of biomarkers for drug susceptibility. The ability to predict susceptibility to a given drug has the potential to significantly increase efficacy while decreasing morbidity and mortality in the relevant patient population. Additionally, it opens the possibility of facilitating the process of bringing new drugs to market. We have demonstrated the efficacy of SFPA for translating signatures discovered <italic>in vitro</italic> into factors which are clearly related to specific biological processes and which can be used to assess important clinical outcomes. The factors may be applied to just one observation (an important consideration for use in a clinical setting), and remain consistent across many different data sets. We do view this as a useful step ahead in thinking about how gene expression genomics will advance us towards the goals of personalized medicine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><p>A total of five signatures were derived from two different experiments on Human Mammary Epithelial Cells (HMEC).

This reflects our belief that, for any particular intervention, there will be relatively few genes (of the over ten thousand that are measured in a microarray experiment) that are affected. For the case outlined in this paper, we argue that growing mammary epithelial cells in the presence of mild lactic acidosis has led to changes in the expression of some of the genes on the array, but that most remain unchanged. Thus our posterior distribution for each <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0004523.e030.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> will consist of a probability that the parameter is non-zero (corresponding to a probability that the gene is differentially expressed in the lactic acidosis experimental group versus the control group), along with a distribution on the magnitude of that possible change.</p><p>The prior on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0004523.e031.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is assumed to be a diffuse inverse gamma distribution (which is a standard conjugate prior), and the prior on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0004523.e032.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> is also given a point mass mixture prior, reflecting the belief that we must maintain significant mass around the extremes (zero and one) even after updating with all of the probes on the chip (50,000&#x0002b;). The precise values of all hyper-parameters are available in the parameter files in the supplementary section.</p><p>We define a signature to be a list of genes and associated weights.
