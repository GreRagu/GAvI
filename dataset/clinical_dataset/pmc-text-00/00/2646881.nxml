To explore farnesyl-mediated molecular interactions, we investigated molecular targets of a T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; analogue that was engineered to have a photoreactive farnesyl analogue, (3-azidophenoxy)geranyl (POG), covalently bound to the C-terminal cysteine of T&#x003b3;. POG-modified T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; was further subjected to modification by methylation at the C-terminal carboxyl group, which copies a complete set of the known posttranscriptional modifications of T&#x003b2;&#x003b3;. Photoaffinity labeling experiment with the photoreactive T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; analogue in its free form indicated that the POG moiety of T&#x003b3; interacted with T&#x003b2;. In the trimeric T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; complex, the POG moiety was cross-linked with T&#x003b1; in addition to concurrent affinity labeling of T&#x003b2;. When photoreactive T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; was reconstituted with T&#x003b1; and light-activated rhodopsin (Rh*) in rod outer segment (ROS) membranes, the POG moiety interacted with not only T&#x003b1; and T&#x003b2; but also Rh* and membrane phospholipids. The cross-linked phospholipid species was analyzed by ELISA employing a variety of lipid-binding probes, which revealed phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) as selective phospholipids for POG interaction in the ROS membranes. These results demonstrate that the modifying group of T&#x003b3; plays an active role in protein&#x02212;protein and protein&#x02212;membrane interactions and suggest that the farnesyl&#x02212;PE/PS interaction may support the efficient formation of the signaling ternary complex between transducin and Rh*.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi800359h</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2008-00359h</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>In vertebrate retinal rod outer segment (ROS),<xref rid="fn3" ref-type="fn">1</xref> light signals are transduced by the photoreceptor-specific G protein transducin, which links photolysis of rhodopsin to activation of cGMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). Transducin (T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3;) is comprised of three subunits: T&#x003b1; (<italic>M</italic><sub>r</sub> 37000), T&#x003b2; (<italic>M</italic><sub>r</sub> 35000), and T&#x003b3; (<italic>M</italic><sub>r</sub> 8000). T&#x003b1; contains a binding site for guanine nucleotide (GDP or GTP), whereas T&#x003b2; and T&#x003b3; form a tight complex (T&#x003b2;&#x003b3;) which associates with T&#x003b1; in its GDP-bound form (T&#x003b1;-GDP). In phototransduction, T&#x003b1;-GDP/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; forms a transient ternary complex with a photobleached active intermediate of rhodopsin, metarhodopsin II (abbreviated as Rh* in this paper). Rh* facilitates exchange of GDP bound to T&#x003b1; with cytosolic GTP, resulting in dissociation of the ternary complex into T&#x003b1;-GTP, T&#x003b2;&#x003b3;, and Rh*. A single molecule of Rh* catalyzes formation of several hundreds of T&#x003b1;-GTP. The highly amplified element, T&#x003b1;-GTP, in turn induces a release of the inhibitory &#x003b3;-subunit from the catalytic core &#x003b1;&#x003b2; dimer of PDE, resulting in its activation. The activated PDE hydrolyzes cGMP, which causes hyperpolarization of the membrane potential via an impact on cGMP-dependent cation channels in rod cells. Thus, Rh*-transducin coupling achieves remarkable amplification of the photon signal in retinal rod photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>).<fn id="fn3"><label>1</label><p>Abbreviations: T&#x003b1;, T&#x003b2;, and T&#x003b3;, the &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, and &#x003b3;-subunit of transducin, respectively; Rh*, metarhodopsin II; FTase, farnesyltransferase; ROS, rod outer segment; POG-PP, (3-azidophenoxy)geranyl pyrophosphate; Rce1, Ras converting enzyme 1; Icmt, isoprenyl carboxyl methyltransferase; AdoMet, <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PIP<sub>2</sub>, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; SM, sphingomyelin; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250; PMSF, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; &#x003b2;-ME, &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</p></fn></p><p>We and others have reported that T&#x003b3; is farnesylated at its C-terminal cysteine residue via a thioether bond and, in addition, the C-terminal carboxyl group is methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Subsequent cDNA cloning studies demonstrated that the deduced amino acid sequences of all 12 known subtypes of G protein &#x003b3;-subunits share a common C-terminal CAAX motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). It is now established that posttranslational isoprenylation of the CAAX sequence proceeds via three enzymatic steps, isoprenylation at the cysteine residue in the CAAX motif, AAX cleavage, and then carboxyl methylation. The C-terminal amino acid X is a major determinant for the modification by isoprenyl groups at the cysteine residue in the CAAX motif by either of the two cytosolic enzymes: protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) or protein geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). Farnesylation (C15) by FTase occurs when X is serine, methionine, glutamine, or alanine, while the C-terminus is geranylgeranylated (C20) by GGTase I when X is leucine or phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). After isoprenylation, the AAX sequence in the CAAX motif is removed by a site-specific endoprotease, Ras converting enzyme 1 (Rce1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), and the prenylated cysteine residue newly exposed at the C-terminus is carboxyl methylated by a specific methyltransferase, isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (Icmt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Rce1 and Icmt have been shown to be microsomal membrane-bound enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>), and hence the processing of the prenylated CAAX motifs likely occurs on the microsomal membrane surface prior to the sorting of the fully processed prenylated proteins to the plasma membranes. Isoprenylation and the subsequent carboxyl methylation each confer hydrophobic property to the proteins, and therefore the modifications are generally regarded to enhance the membrane association of the protein. In fact, G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; or Ras proteins lacking CAAX motifs are unable to localize to plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). On the other hand, several lines of evidence have suggested that the farnesyl and geranylgeranyl groups of transducin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), and rhodopsin kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>) play key roles in protein&#x02212;protein interactions. For example, mutant T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; consisting of T&#x003b3; truncated at the C-terminus, or T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; lacking the farnesyl moiety, is defective in catalyzing the GDP&#x02212;GTP exchange reaction on T&#x003b1; in the presence of Rh* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). It has also been shown that synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal region of T&#x003b3; inhibited T&#x003b1;&#x02212;T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; interaction only when the peptides were isoprenylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; has another binding partner, phosducin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), that is a soluble 33 kDa protein abundantly present in the inner region of the rod photoreceptor cells. Although phosducin is phosphorylated in the dark, it is dephosphorylated upon receiving intense light and binds to T&#x003b2;&#x003b3;, which then loses its membrane-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). The physiological roles of phosducin and its light-dependent dephosphorylation are still elusive, but one of its possible roles could be to inhibit T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; from interacting with T&#x003b1; or effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). The sequestration of T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; by phosducin may serve as a regulatory mechanism of the light signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the farnesylation, the carboxyl methylation also plays a physiological role for isoprenylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>), such as T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) and Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Our previous experiments showed that farnesylated and methylated T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; supported more efficiently the GDP&#x02212;GTP exchange reaction on T&#x003b1; catalyzed by Rh* when compared with farnesylated and nonmethylated T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). More evidently, the binding of farnesylated T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; to the ROS membranes was strongly facilitated by the carboxyl methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the farnesylation of T&#x003b3; is indispensable for transducin to couple with Rh*, and the carboxyl methylation synergistically enhances this coupling. In spite of such an important role(s) of the farnesyl group, the interacting target(s) of the modifying lipid has not yet been directly demonstrated at each step of the signaling process. In structural studies on G proteins, the exact location of the isoprenoid group has not been identified by X-ray crystallography because most of the studies have employed engineered proteins lacking the prenyl group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>).</p><p>In order to investigate farnesyl-mediated molecular interactions, several groups have synthesized photoreactive farnesyl analogues, among which (2-diazo-3,3,3-trifluoropropionyloxy)geranyl pyrophosphate (abbreviated as DATFP-GPP) was successfully recognized by prenyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). The interaction between the prenyltransferase and DATFP during the transfer reaction has been demonstrated, but possibly due to the chemical instability of DATFP, only a few labeling experiments have been performed successfully with the photoreactive compound incorporated into G protein after the transfer reaction. A single paper reported photoaffinity labeling of GDI with DATFP-modified Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). On the other hand, we previously developed another photoreactive farnesyl analogue, (3-azidophenoxy)geranyl pyrophosphate (abbreviated as POG-PP), which has the photoreactive azidophenoxy group at the distal end of the structure, and created <italic>in vitro</italic> a functional (but nonmethylated) T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; analogue in which the farnesyl was replaced by POG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). In the present study, we have generated the carboxyl methylated POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; (POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-OMe) by utilizing the processing enzymes, FTase, Rce1, and Icmt, in order to examine the mode of molecular interaction of the POG moiety in the T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; analogue having the complete set of modifications at the C-terminus of T&#x003b3;.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Materials</title><p>[<sup>35</sup>S]GTP&#x003b3;S was purchased from NEN DuPont.

When T&#x003b1;-GDP was added to the reaction mixture, the 45 kDa band of T&#x003b3;&#x02212;T&#x003b1; cross-linked product was detected in the supernatant (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, panel a, lane 3). This cross-linked product disappeared when the mixture received 10 &#x003bc;M GTP&#x003b3;S (lane 5), showing that T&#x003b1;-GDP conversion to the GTP&#x003b3;S-bound form results in the Rh*/T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; ternary complex decomposing into the three components. This observation therefore indicates a transient and stage-specific interaction between the modifying lipid of T&#x003b3; and T&#x003b1;-GDP. On the other hand, no significant effect of T&#x003b1; nor GTP&#x003b3;S was observed for T&#x003b3;&#x02212;T&#x003b2; cross-link level in the membrane pellet (panel c, lanes 2, 4, and 6), suggesting a default position of the modifying lipid of T&#x003b3; in the T&#x003b2; pocket.</p><p>In the presence of T&#x003b1;-GDP and Rh*-containing ROS membranes, a broad band of 43 kDa product was detected by anti-T&#x003b3; antibody in the membrane fraction (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, panel a, lane 4). The 43 kDa broad band was not observed in our previous study using the nonmethylated form of POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; under the equivalent experimental condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). The 43 kDa broad band was not attributable to T&#x003b3;&#x02212;T&#x003b2; cross-linked product, because the anti-G&#x003b2; blot demonstrated comparable levels of T&#x003b3;&#x02212;T&#x003b2; product in the presence and absence of T&#x003b1;-GDP (panel c, lanes 2 and 4). We concluded that the 43 kDa broad band represents a cross-linked product of POG-T&#x003b3;-OMe (8 kDa) and Rh* (35 kDa) because of its reactivity to anti-rhodopsin antibody (data not shown) and the broad shape of the band characteristic of rhodopsin having heteromultimeric carbohydrate chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). The T&#x003b3;&#x02212;Rh* interaction was eliminated by GTP&#x003b3;S disruption of the Rh*/T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; ternary complex (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, panel a, lane 6), indicating a transient interaction between Rh* and the modifying lipid of T&#x003b3; in the ternary complex. In order to explore the specificity of this cross-link, Rh*-containing membranes were replaced with opsin membranes, in which rhodopsin was converted to inactive opsin harboring the hydrolyzed chromophore, retinal oxime. In the absence of T&#x003b1;, the labeling pattern (lanes 7 and 8) was very similar to that observed with Rh*-containing membranes (lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the 43 kDa broad band was detected far more faintly by anti-T&#x003b3; antibody in the membrane fraction (lane 10). This observation supports the conclusion that the T&#x003b3;-Rh* cross-link is dependent on the activation state of rhodopsin. The faint broad band of 43 kDa product observed with opsin membranes may represent a very low intrinsic activity of opsin to form the ternary complex capable of activating transducin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). Therefore, the 43 kDa band (lane 10) is probably cross-linked product of T&#x003b3; and opsin in the opsin/T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; complex.</p><p>In addition to the cross-linked product of T&#x003b3;-Rh*, we observed another band showing the anti-T&#x003b3; immunoreactivity at the region near the gel front (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, panel b, lane 4). This product, which was found only in the membrane but not in the soluble fractions (panel b), exhibited a slightly slower mobility than that of free T&#x003b3; and was termed T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X. A faint band of the T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X product was detected in the absence of T&#x003b1; in the membrane fraction (lane 2), while the band intensity was dramatically increased by the addition of T&#x003b1;-GDP (lane 4) and markedly reduced by the addition of 10 &#x003bc;M GTP&#x003b3;S (lane 6). This dynamic change of the T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X cross-link level was mostly blunted by replacing Rh*-containing membranes with opsin membranes (lanes 8, 10, and 12). Because the T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X cross-linked product could be degraded by treatment with phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> but not with sphingomyelinase treatment (Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, lanes 6 and 8), the small molecule X was considered as a glycerophospholipid. Collectively, these results demonstrate the transient nature of the T&#x003b3;&#x02212;glycerophospholipid interaction occurring selectively at the stage of the ternary complex formation.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Characterization of T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X product.

To this aim, we performed extraction of T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X product from the membranes. Rh*-containing ROS membranes with POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-OMe and T&#x003b1; were subjected to UV irradiation, and the membranes were then washed with a hypotonic buffer including 10 &#x003bc;M GTP&#x003b3;S to eliminate T&#x003b1; and POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-OMe from the membranes (Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, lanes 5&#x02212;10). We then attempted to extract T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X from the washed membranes by adding phosducin, since phosducin is known to extract T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; from the membranes by forming a stable soluble complex with T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). The T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X product was, however, resistant to the phosducin extraction (lanes 11&#x02212;14).

The resultant extract (i.e., the soluble fraction) was applied to reverse-phase HPLC equipped with a C4 column and eluted by a linear gradient of CH<sub>3</sub>CN.

We first established the condition in which T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X was adsorbed to the well of the microtiter plate as efficiently as was retinal T&#x003b3; when they were probed by anti-T&#x003b3; antibody. Under the condition, the wells coated with T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X and retinal T&#x003b3; gave comparable signal intensities (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, panel A). Then we focused our study on PC, PE, PS, SM, and PIP<sub>2</sub>, since these lipid species comprise the major population of total phospholipids in bovine ROS membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>) and PIP<sub>2</sub> level is known to increase in the light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> (panels B&#x02212;F), each control lipid was selectively detected by the anti-lipid probes, indicating that these probes recognize their targets in this ELISA analysis. Under the condition, purified T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X showed high reactivities to both anti-PS antibody (panel C) and Ro09-0198 (panel B), a 19 amino acid tetracyclic peptide that specifically binds with PE, whereas the other lipid probes, anti-PC and anti-PIP<sub>2</sub> antibodies and SM-binding peptide lysenin, revealed extremely low signals (panels D&#x02212;F). In contrast, retinal T&#x003b3; showed no reactivities to the two probes, Ro09-0198 or anti-PS antibody (panels B and C). An additional control experiment was performed in this ELISA by immobilizing the lipid background sample derived from the UV-irradiated ROS membranes (ROS control). The wells gave negligible signals toward every probe tested (Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), indicating that the HPLC fraction containing T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X did not contain a significant amount of free lipids that are reactive to the probes. These results indicate that the positive signals observed for the fraction containing T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X toward Ro09-0198 and anti-PS antibody are derived from X. We conclude that the distal tip of the hydrophobic moiety of T&#x003b3; C-terminus is located in close vicinity of PE and PS when the Rh*/T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; ternary complex is assembled in the ROS membranes.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Characterization of T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X product by ELISA analysis.

These posttranscriptional modifications not only play important roles for the membrane interaction of the modified G proteins but also provide specific protein&#x02212;protein interaction essential for the G protein signaling. In spite of the importance, the exact sites of the farnesyl group located in the T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; trimer and the Rh*/T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; complex have remained to be determined. In the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>), we developed a photoreactive farnesyl analogue POG and demonstrated a dynamic change in molecular interaction of the modifying group depending on the steps in the light signal transduction process. In that study, however, we used a nonmethylated form of POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; because it was difficult to obtain a sufficient amount of the methylated form of POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; at the time. To circumvent this issue, we have developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> posttranslational modification procedure by enzymatic catalyses with Rce1 and Icmt. To obtain sufficient yields of POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-OMe, we have improved our previous procedures through the following modifications: (i) reduction of the NaCl concentration of the reaction buffer from 150 to 50 mM to prevent association of POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-OMe with the Sf9 cell membranes; (ii) performing the carboxyl methylation reaction at 30 &#x000b0;C to reduce the demethylation reaction. Under the modified conditions employed, we were able to obtain a form of POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-OMe in which the C-terminal cysteine residue was almost completely modified with the methyl group (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>Photoaffinity labeling of POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-OMe in the aqueous phase invariably yielded a cross-linked product of T&#x003b3;&#x02212;T&#x003b2; (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, panels a and c, lane 3), reflecting a constitutive interaction of the C-terminal farnesyl with T&#x003b2;. The observed interaction of the modifying group with T&#x003b2; is consistent with the previous structural study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>), which suggested the presence of the farnesyl-binding pocket in T&#x003b2; that is complexed with T&#x003b3; and phosducin. The second interaction between the modified group of T&#x003b3; and T&#x003b1; was observed in the aqueous phase, where the T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; heterotrimer formed (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, panels a and b, lane 4). These modes of interaction of POG with T&#x003b1; and T&#x003b2; were also observed in the previous study employing the nonmethylated form of POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). It seems likely that the farnesyl group is invariably located in or close to the propeller structure of T&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>) and plays an additional role in mediating the subunit&#x02212;subunit interaction between T&#x003b1; and T&#x003b2; when T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; couples with T&#x003b1;. Consistent with this, a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) demonstrated that the formation of the T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; trimeric complex was disrupted by the synthetic farnesylated peptide corresponding to the C-terminus of T&#x003b3;. While structural studies have suggested the N-terminal &#x003b1;-helix of T&#x003b1; may be the interacting target of the farnesyl group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>), our efforts toward identifying the POG-T&#x003b3;-linked peptide of T&#x003b1; resulted in failure due to the low yield of the cross-linked peptide. The relative content of the cross-linked product of T&#x003b3;-T&#x003b1; in total T&#x003b1; was estimated to be approximately 2% as judged from the distribution of T&#x003b1; immunoreactivities between free T&#x003b1; and the T&#x003b3;&#x02212;T&#x003b1; product (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, panel b, lane 4). The low yield is not a reflection of nonspecific interaction because (i) the labeling pattern changed dynamically depending on the signaling state (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B) and (ii) no labeling was detected for a carrier protein, soybean trypsin inhibitor, that was included in a large excess of POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-OMe in all of the photoaffinity labeling mixtures.</p><p>Under conditions in which the Rh*/T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; complex is formed in the ROS membranes, cross-linked products of POG-T&#x003b3;-OMe with Rh* and with a low molecular component X were detected in the membrane fraction (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, panels a and b, lane 4). The cross-linked product of T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X was degraded by PLA<sub>2</sub>, indicating that X is a glycerophospholipid; this third interaction is similar to that we found in our previous study employing the nonmethylated form of POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). On the other hand, the fourth interaction with Rh* is newly detected in this study, and it was not detectable when we used the nonmethylated form of POG-T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). It is likely that the interaction of Rh* with T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; mediated by the farnesyl group is significantly stabilized by the carboxyl methylation of T&#x003b3;. One possible mechanism mediating the stabilization is that the methyl esterification of the C-terminal carboxyl moiety reduces the repulsion between the carboxyl anion and the negatively charged head groups of the membrane phospholipids, which may enable the farnesyl moiety to stick into the lipid bilayer in the close vicinity of Rh*. The results are consistent with our previous observations: The carboxyl methylation of T&#x003b3; augments the ability of farnesylated transducin to bind with Rh* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), thereby enhancing the GDP&#x02212;GTP exchange reaction on T&#x003b1; catalyzed by Rh* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Interestingly, it was shown that a farnesylated (but nonmethylated) oligopeptide mimicking the C-terminal structure of T&#x003b3; interacted with Rh* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). However, the concentrations of the farnesylated peptide employed in those studies are far greater than that of T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; used in the present study. It is likely that the carboxyl methylation of the C-terminus is required for the efficient interaction of T&#x003b3; C-terminus with Rh*. Taken together, our data indicate that the modifying group of T&#x003b3; interacts with the membrane phospholipid probably as an anchor of T&#x003b1;-GDP/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; in order for the trimer to couple efficiently with Rh* in the ROS membranes.</p><p>In order to identify the molecular species of the phospholipid in the T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X product that was generated at the stage of forming the Rh*/T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; complex (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, panel b, lane 4), we extracted the T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X product and performed ELISA analysis using five different types of lipid-binding probes. The T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X product was reactive to Ro09-0198 that is the PE-binding peptide and to anti-PS antibody, but not to anti-PC, anti-PIP<sub>2</sub> antibodies nor lysenin, a SM-binding protein. These data suggest that when the ternary complex is formed, the farnesyl moiety of T&#x003b3; interacts preferentially with PE and PS in the ROS membranes. Previous studies showed that PE, PC, PS, PI, and SM make up approximately 38.5&#x02212;43.0%, 36.0&#x02212;51.7%, 7.2&#x02212;13.7%, 1.7&#x02212;5.9%, and 1.0&#x02212;3.6%, respectively, of the total phospholipids of the bovine ROS membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). The selective interaction between the modifying group of T&#x003b3; and PE/PS is explained in several ways. One possibility is that the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids between inner (intradiscal) and outer (cytoplasmic) leaflets of the disk membrane may have caused the preferential labeling of PE/PS. It was reported that the intradiscal leaflet is mainly composed of PC and cholesterol whereas the cytoplasmic leaflet is enriched with PE and PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). Because the farnesylated T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; is predominantly localized at the cytoplasmic surface of the disk membranes, the farnesylated T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; may have higher probability to interact with PE and PS rather than with PC, PIP<sub>2</sub>, and SM. However, the highly specific pattern of the labeling with PE and PS may not be explained only by this population model. An alternative possibility is that the farnesylated T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; might be localized in a membrane microdomain enriched with these particular phospholipids. A considerable number of studies suggests that Rh* in ROS membranes is localized to the distinct membrane domain surrounded by lipids with small head groups such as PE with bulky acyl chains such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6&#x003c9;3), which together produce a condensed bilayer surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). In addition, PE with DHA significantly enhances the photochemical activity of rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). It is thus possible that the preferential cross-linking observed between the modifying group of T&#x003b3; and PE/PS at the stage of forming the Rh*/T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; complex may reflect a unique lipid composition surrounding the complex in the ROS membranes. Hence, in addition to facilitating the coupling of transducin for efficient amplification of the signaling, the farnesylated and methylated C-terminus of T&#x003b3; may serve as a sensor to monitor the phospholipid microenvironment of Rh*.</p><p>Within our experimental data, it was not possible to identify the target site (atom) in the phospholipid molecule cross-linked with the POG group. In general, active nitrene derived from the azido group preferentially reacts with the electron-rich residue, such as an amino group or a double bond in the acyl chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). PE and PS have a primary amino group in the polar head and usually retain C=C double bonds in the fatty acid chains. These sites are electron-rich and hence could be good candidates for the cross-linking target with the POG group. When we turn our attention to the position of T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X, we always observed weak signals of T&#x003b3;&#x02212;phospholipid cross-link in the pellet fractions of all the labeling mixtures including those containing inactive opsin in the membranes (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, panel b, even numbered lanes). These weak signals might be partly attributable to the inherent chemical reactivity of the phospholipids such as PE and PS having the amino group in the polar head. On the other hand, in the presence of light-activated rhodopsin and transducin trimers (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, panel b, lane 4), the T&#x003b3;&#x02212;phospholipid cross-linked product gave a selectively strong signal, and this product was extracted and analyzed in detail (Figures <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Here we should emphasize that, in the ELISA analysis, the T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X was detected by cyclic antibiotic peptide Ro09-0198 and anti-PS antibody that recognize strictly the structure of PE and PS, respectively. In particular, the PE head group including the primary amine at the ethanolamine moiety is indispensable for the recognition of PE by Ro09-0198, and chemical modifications of the primary amine abolish completely the recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). It is thus likely that the distal tip of the farnesyl analogue is predominantly cross-linked with the acyl chains rather than the head group of PE and PS. When applied to the farnesyl, the distal end would stick deep into the membrane bilayer as an anchor or as an interface between Rh* and the surrounding phospholipids when the Rh*/T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; ternary complex is assembled. Importantly, the degree of this interaction with the phospholipids is not static but highly variable depending on the receptor activation (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, panel b). The weak signals of T&#x003b3;&#x02212;X cross-link constantly observed in the membrane fraction under various conditions (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, panel b) are suggestive of location of the modifying lipid of T&#x003b3; in equilibrium between the T&#x003b2; pocket and the lipid layer surface, when the receptor is in the resting state of signaling.</p><p>In summary, we have developed a novel analogue of fully modified T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; for photoaffinity labeling studies and demonstrated that the modifying group of T&#x003b3; mediates both the protein&#x02212;protein and the protein&#x02212;membrane interactions in Rh*/T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; complex formation. The farnesyl-Rh* or farnesyl-PE/PS interaction appears to facilitate transducin to form efficiently the ternary complex with Rh*. Further analysis of the cross-linked lipids may provide insight into the mechanism underlying the dynamic formation of the Rh*/T&#x003b1;/T&#x003b2;&#x003b3; complex in the ROS membranes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Dr. Yoshikazu Ohya (The University of Tokyo) for the kind gift of FTase expression vector.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="cit1"><name><surname>Arshavsky</surname><given-names>V.
