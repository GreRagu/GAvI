One recently recognized target for such intervention is adipose tissue, which secretes a variety of bioactive substances including prostaglandins. Prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) has been shown to decrease lipolysis in adipocytes, but limited studies have explored alternative mechanisms by which PGE<sub>2 </sub>might impact obesity, such as adipogenesis or lipogenesis. Studies conducted on <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+ </sup>mice indicated that selective inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 enzyme led to significant reductions in fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity in adipose tissue suggesting lipogenic effects of PGE<sub>2</sub>. To further investigate whether these lipid mediators directly regulate lipogenesis, we used 3T3-L1 adipocytes to determine the impact of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and celecoxib on PGE<sub>2 </sub>formation and FAS used as a lipogenic marker. Both arachidonic acid (AA) and EPA dose-dependently increased PGE secretion from adipocytes. AA was expectedly more potent and exhibiting at 150 uM dose a 5-fold increase in PGE<sub>2 </sub>secretion over EPA. Despite higher secretion of PGE by EPA and AA compared to control, neither PUFA significantly altered FAS activity. By contrast both AA and EPA significantly decreased FAS mRNA levels. Addition of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, significantly decreased PGE<sub>2 </sub>secretion (p &#x0003c; 0.05) versus control, and also significantly decreased FAS activity (p &#x0003c; 0.05). Unexpectedly, the combination of exogenous PGE<sub>2 </sub>and celecoxib further decreased the FAS activity compared to PGE<sub>2 </sub>alone or untreated controls. In conclusion, EPA-mediated inhibition of AA metabolism did not significantly alter FAS activity while both AA and EPA significantly decreased FAS mRNA expression. COX-2 inhibition significantly decreased PGE<sub>2 </sub>production resulting in a decrease in FAS activity and expression that was not reversed with the addition of exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub>, suggesting an additional mechanism that is independent of COX-2.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Several bioactive molecules and hormones have been reported to be secreted by adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Related to our current work, the secretion of prostaglandins such as prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) has been shown in human and rodent adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Further, the presence of prostaglandin E receptors (EP<sub>1&#x02013;4</sub>) in these tissues as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] has led to research into a possible autocrine or paracrine role for this Arachidonic Acid (AA) metabolite. Several studies reported antilipolytic roles for PGE<sub>2 </sub>in cultured adipocytes and adipose tissue explants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], most likely acting through a G-inhibitory protein-coupled EP<sub>3 </sub>receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], confirming a paracrine/autocrine role of PGE<sub>2 </sub>in adipocytes. Additional roles for PGE<sub>2 </sub>in adipocytes include increased secretion of leptin release from mouse adipose tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and decreased hepatic lipogenic gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These studies did not, however, address whether PGE<sub>2 </sub>also exerts lipogenic or adipogenic effects in adipocytes.</p><p>Several studies have explored regulation of hepatic lipogenesis by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, these effects may be tissue specific as hepatic and adipose lipogenesis may be differentially regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 n-6) has been shown to stimulate glucose intake in adipocytes by increasing glucose receptor levels in the cell membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] potentially increasing substrate availability for de novo lipogenesis. AA is also the preferential substrate for the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, resulting in production of PG and other metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In mature adipocytes, PGE<sub>2 </sub>is the primary PG produced from the COX pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In most cases, AA and dietary eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3) exert opposing effects; however, hepatic lipogenesis is downregulated by both fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. EPA impacts adipocyte biological functions via two distinct mechanisms. The first is via transcriptional activation of lipogenic and adipogenic genes by binding to nuclear receptors such as PPARgamma. The second mechanism is via direct competition with AA for incorporation into membrane phospholipids and subsequent conversion to eicosanoids including PGs. While the first mechanism has been extensively studied, few studies have addressed the second mechanism in adipocytes. Synthesized or preformed AA is incorporated into the sn-2 position of cell membrane phospholipids and subsequently liberated by phospholipases (cPLA<sub>2</sub>). COX metabolizes AA into PGE<sub>2</sub>, which is then secreted by the cell to act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion via specific EP receptors. EPA competes with AA for incorporation into cell membrane phospholipids and for the active site on the COX enzymes when cPLA<sub>2 </sub>is activated. This competition and the resulting production of PGE<sub>3 </sub>when COX metabolizes EPA, could result in decreased levels of PGE<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Decreased PGs production, and particularly PGE<sub>2</sub>, by COX-2 inhibitors has been demonstrated in adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Further, initial in vivo studies demonstrated that inhibition of PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthesis decreased FAS activity in mouse adipose tissue and this was largely reversed by co-treatment with PGE<sub>2 </sub>receptor agonist. We hypothesized that these effects reflected direct actions of PGE<sub>2 </sub>(or its modulators, PUFA or COX ligands) on adipose tissue. Specifically we tested whether manipulation of PGE<sub>2 </sub>levels by addition of EPA (dietary intervention) or selective COX-2 inhibition (pharmaceutical intervention) decreases PGE<sub>2 </sub>production from adipocytes and subsequently downregulates FAS enzyme activity. If AA and EPA modulate FAS activity or expression via changes in PGE<sub>2 </sub>levels, it is then expected that these fatty acids exert opposite effects on FAS expression. We performed a series of experiments in cultured adipocytes which provide compelling evidence that PUFA effects on adipose tissue FAS were independent of changes in PGE levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Experiment Design</title><sec><title>Animal Experiments</title><p>Male C57BL/6J <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+ </sup>mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) were obtained at 4&#x02013;6 weeks of age.

Culture medium was composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). Cells were plated on day 1 (~200,000 cells/100 mm dish) and grown for 3&#x02013;4 days to confluence. At confluence, media was changed and supplemented with 250 nM Dex, 0.5 mM Mix, and 10 nM insulin for 48 h to induce adipocyte differentiation, after which cells were cultured with regular media supplemented with insulin. Differentiation was considered complete at 5&#x02013;7 days post-confluence. Twenty-four hours prior to treatment, regular media was replaced with starvation media consisting of DMEM, P/S, and 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA). Treatment media consisted of starvation media + 10 nM insulin and individual (FA or inhibitor) treatments. Because fatty acids are primarily found in the circulation as bound to albumin and numerous studies have used this form of the fatty acid for cell culture studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], all fatty acids in our experiments were conjugated with BSA prior to the treatment. Fatty acids were diluted in DMSO, added to the treatment media and incubated in a shaking water bath for 2 hours at 37&#x000b0;C to facilitate this binding. All treatments lasted 48 hours. Fatty acids were purchased from Nu-Check Prep, Inc., Elysian, MN. All studies were conducted in cells that were at least 80&#x02013;95% differentiated as assessed by lipid accumulation to insure findings are attributed to differentiated rather than undifferentiated fat cells.

Increasing doses of EPA as reported in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> led to increased PGE<sub>2</sub> levels, presumably due to the formation of PGE<sub>3</sub> (41) as the antibody had a weak cross reactivity of PGE<sub>3</sub> with the PGE<sub>2</sub>.

Addition of EPA in the absence of cultured cells led to extremely low levels of PGE confirming that the observed effects were not a consequence of non-specific lipid peroxidation and that increased PGE<sub>2</sub> levels measured in EPA treated cell cultures, supporting the likelihood of PGE<sub>3</sub> formation, which is detectable with the PGE<sub>2</sub> immunoassay used.

Further, it is well established that PGE<sub>2 </sub>decreases lipolysis in adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our current study addressed whether PGE<sub>2 </sub>also induces lipogenic activities in adipocytes, which could further enhance their hypertrophic effects in these cells. We have previously reported responsiveness of the <italic>Apc</italic><sup>Min/+ </sup>mice to changes in prostaglandin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In this study we tested whether changes in prostaglandins modulated fatty acid synthesis in adipose tissue of these mice. We demonstrated that inhibition of the COX enzymes by piroxicam (or other COX inhibitors, data not shown) decrease FAS activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>); this effect was reversed by admnistering mice EP receptor agonists. These results demonstrate that a lipogenic and receptor-mediated effect of PGE<sub>2</sub>, which coupled with its previously reported antilipolytic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] likely favor triglyceride storage. To further test direct effects of PGE<sub>2 </sub>manipulation in adipocytes, we used 3T3-L1 adipocytes and used dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (AA and EPA) as well as pharmacological means (COX inhibition) to modulate prostaglandin levels. Our goal was to test whether changes in PGE<sub>2 </sub>levels led to parallel changes in FAS activity or expression.</p><p>We report here dose-dependent increases in PGE<sub>2 </sub>levels with AA and EPA treatments (p &#x0003c; 0.001) and, as expected, AA exhibited a more potent induction of PGE<sub>2 </sub>secretion versus EPA or control. Very limited information exists in the literature regarding physiological levels of EPA, but they are unlikely to approach those of AA due to large difference in their levels in membrane phospholipids. Studies conducted on postmenopausal women fed fish oil found the EPA levels of plasma lipids was 750 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our dose response studies indicate that despite the clearly powerful effect of AA in increasing PGE<sub>2 </sub>(compared to EPA), the latter was also able to significantly elevate PGE<sub>2 </sub>levels especially at the 200 and 500 uM doses. Doses at 500 uM and above visibly impacted cell viability and morphology (data not shown). Based on the manufacturer's information for cross-reactivity (and confirmed in our laboratory), the assay also detects PGE<sub>3</sub> (cross reactivity with PGE<sub>2 </sub>antibody), which may explain at least in part increased PGE<sub>2 </sub>levels with EPA. Although the binding affinities of AA and EPA for both isoforms of COX are equivalent (<italic>Km </italic>= 5 &#x003bc;M), COX-1 and -2 oxygenate EPA at ~10% and ~35%, respectively, compared to the rate for AA when added exogenously to cultured cells. Compared to AA, EPA is a poorer substrate for COX-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Complicating this issue further is the fact that very little is known concerning the actions of PGE<sub>3 </sub>and its subsequent down stream signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Studies in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts found that PGE<sub>3 </sub>activated the same signaling pathways as PGE<sub>2</sub>, but with much less efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This would imply that high levels of PGE<sub>3</sub> might duplicate the actions of PGE<sub>2</sub>, suggesting there would be a point of diminishing returns with EPA supplementation and thus the importance of using appropriate low doses for experimentation and supplementation. It is also possible that PGE<sub>3</sub> may bind to EP receptors with affinities that differ significantly from PGE<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], whereby the type and number of receptors in adipocytes would also influence the impact of EPA supplementation. While it is important to point out these differences in PGE<sub>2 </sub>vs. PGE<sub>3 </sub>formation, the main focus of this paper is primarily on the role of PG and COX in modulating fatty acid synthesis.</p><p>Based on our dose response data, we chose to use intermediate dosage of 150 &#x003bc;M for the rest of our experiments. This dose is also consistent with the findings of other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], which demonstrated the ability to manipulate secreted PGE<sub>2 </sub>by using EPA to compete with AA for incorporation into membrane phospholipids and subsequent PG production.</p><p>PGE<sub>2 </sub>levels in the CI treatment group were significantly lower than controls. Although the celecoxib preferentially inhibits COX-2, no studies have shown whether it reduces PGE<sub>2 </sub>levels in adipocytes. Most published evidence indicates that inducible enzyme COX-2 is not expressed at physiologically relevant levels in mature adipocytes under normal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, since we used a CI dose (1 &#x003bc;M) similar to that of IC<sub>50 </sub>(1.2 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]), it is plausible that constitutively expressed COX-1 activity was also inhibited at this dose. Using FAS as a marker of adipocyte lipogenesis, our data showed decreases in FAS activity with the CI treatment. In agreement with our finding, another study also showed that a non-specific COX inhibitor, aspirin, also decreases lipogenesis or levels of triacylglycerols in adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The overall comparison of PGE levels for the AA, EPA, and AA + EPA treatment groups correlated well with previously published data measuring tissue concentrations of these fatty acids in mice fed diets supplemented with these fatty acids, although the end points measured and experimental models were different in our study compared to those reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>Treatment of adipocytes with either EPA or AA elicited significant reductions in FAS mRNA compared to control, consistent with previously reported inhibition of FAS message by PUFA (36) in a degree of unsaturation and chain length-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Therefore, regulation of FAS expression in adipocytes by PUFA is independent of changes in prostaglandin levels. Alternatively, PG could be directly controlling FAS gene expression via a receptor-mediated mechanism. Such opposing effects may be explained by direct transcriptional effects of EPA and AA on the FAS gene. Indeed, this theory is in line with results from Deng et al. showing that degree of unsaturation correlated highly with suppression of the SREBP-1c promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], the main transcription factor regulating FAS and other lipogenic genes. However, it is worth noting that since mRNA stability was not measured in these experiments, it is also possible that increased stability was responsible for the discrepancy between decreased FAS mRNA expression and small changes in FAS activity in response to PUFA treatments. It is also possible that this discrepancy is due to a longer half-life of the FAS protein such that we were unable to detect changes in enzyme activity within our treatment times (24&#x02013;48 hours). Indeed, previous studies have shown that changes in FAS mRNA half-life depend on cell culture treatments and state of differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Another possibility is that PGE<sub>2 </sub>treatments stimulate leptin secretion (as previously documented Fain et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]) and elevated leptin levels may subsequently decrease lipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Thus, decreased FAS expression may indirectly reflect effects of PGE<sub>2 </sub>mediated by leptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Unfortunately, due to the very low levels of leptin secretion in 3T3-L1, we were not able to assess regulation of leptin in these cells. Additional possible mechanisms may involve the antithetic actions of the EP receptors. Long et al. investigated the role of COX mediated products of AA metabolism on regulation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4). They found that a 50-fold increase in endogenous PGE<sub>2 </sub>or exposure to 10 &#x003bc;M exogenous PGE<sub>2 </sub>resulted in an increase in cAMP concentrations, consistent with activation of the EP<sub>2</sub>/EP<sub>4 </sub>receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Additionally, studies using the specific COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 on cortical collecting duct cells found that NS-398 treatment increased EP<sub>3 </sub>and EP<sub>4 </sub>receptor expression 3-fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Although the concentration of exogenous PGE<sub>2 </sub>added in our treatments was much lower, preliminary gene expression studies demonstrate that celecoxib also influenced the expression of EP receptors (specifically EP<sub>4</sub>, data not shown), which may differ from effects of aspirin or other non-specific COX inhibitors. An increase in EP<sub>4 </sub>receptors and the resulting increase in cAMP would activate a pathway that would oppose the decrease in cAMP responsible for the PGE<sub>2 </sub>mediated decrease in lipolysis. Further work with EP receptor concentration and mechanism of action is necessary to delineate the exact role of each receptor in regulating adipocyte metabolism.</p><p>One surprising finding is that PGE<sub>2 </sub>recapitulated the decrease of FAS activity and expression by COX inhibition but that combined PGE<sub>2 </sub>and celecoxib treatments further decreased FAS. These results may be due to and complicated by changes in EP receptor expression and signaling with PGE<sub>2 </sub>addition. It is also possible that the pathways mediating PGE<sub>2 </sub>effects via its receptors are different from those affected by COX inhibition. Further, COX inhibition was more potent than EPA in reducing FAS, possibly due to higher levels of the two PGE isoforms in the presence of EPA compared to control.</p><p>Overall, our studies demonstrated the ability to pharmacologically decrease production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>using the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, which resulted in a significant reduction in lipogenic enzyme activity. The use of EPA was also shown to result in lower production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>when compared to AA treatment. FAS mRNA expression was decreased by FA treatment in a manner similar to the PUFA effects seen in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Given that SREBP1c, an insulin responsive transcription factor, mediates PUFA regulation of hepatic lipogenic genes, it is possible that PUFA regulation of adipocyte metabolism modulates insulin sensitivity. Indeed, in the absence of insulin, our cells expressed significantly higher PGE<sub>2 </sub>levels than in the presence of insulin (data not shown).</p><p>Low PGE<sub>2 </sub>levels led to decreased lipogenesis and thus a reduction in PGE<sub>2 </sub>levels would result in less inhibition of lipolysis, which coupled with reported antilipogenic effects of EPA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids would still favorably impact adipose tissue levels and result in decreased adiposity.</p><p>Further experimentation is required to determine the mechanism of action of celecoxib and EPA versus PGE<sub>2 </sub>in adipose tissue. Additional data on the receptor affinities and actions of PGE<sub>3</sub>, although difficult to approach at this time given the lack of data in this area, are necessary in order to understand the mechanism mediating EPA and PGE<sub>3 </sub>effects on lipid metabolism.</p><p>This study also brings to light the need for further studies on the function and impact of PGE<sub>3</sub> in adipocytes to determine if it does in fact elicit the same responses as PGE<sub>2</sub>. If this is the case, then it may indicate a point of diminishing benefit and the need to specify a consumption range instead of recommending minimum consumption levels. Understanding the mechanisms involved with EPA metabolism takes on further importance with the FDA move to allow qualified health claims for omega-3 fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], as this will most certainly bring more attention to these fatty acids and increase their consumption even further.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PW carried out PG and FAS analysis studies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and first draft of the manuscript; YM performed analyses of mouse adipose tissue; NK contributed to data analysis and manuscript writing; SK contributed to cell culture studies; MHP carried out the mouse studies; AS carried out and reviewed statistical analysis of the data; KC contributed to experimental design in cultured cells and to manuscript writing; BHV contributed to cell culture design and manuscript writing; JW carried out experimental design of the mouse studies and contributed to design of the cell culture experiment and manuscript review and editing; NMM conceived and coordinated this study, carried out the experimental design of the cell culture experiments, trained PW, YM and NK and finalized the manuscript for submission; All authors read and approved the final manuscript version.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by a USDA CSREES NRI Grant 2005-35200-15224 and by the TN agricultural experiment station.
