The fact that this is an insulin sensitive pathway suggests that inflammatory modulation may alter insulin signaling in overweight men.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The low-grade inflammatory state often seen in overweight subjects is thought to play an important role in lifestyle associated disease development.

Since the early 1990s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Bonassi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, considerable effort has been made to discover and validate biomarkers with diagnostic or prognostic utility for lifestyle associated diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Musaad1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Khuseyinova1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Rajaram1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Metabolites such as cholesterol, fasting glucose and homocysteine have long been used as biomarkers. Genomic &#x02013; based technologies such as metabolic profiling provide a new means to explore the combination of multiple metabolites as a biomarker, which may allow for more precise outcome predictions. Alternatively, such a biomarker may provide a more comprehensive insight into pathophysiological processes not previously attainable with traditional biomarkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-He1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Ginsburg1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Wang1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. These markers should respond to nutritional and pharmaceutical interventions in order to be evaluated.</p><p>The main focus of the present study was to demonstrate and quantify the consequence of using diclofenac to reduce inflammation and its effect on metabolism. Subsequently, the study was geared to identify multiple metabolites to be used as a potential biomarker. Diclofenac acts as a non-selective inhibitor of the enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 and -2. Cyclooxygenases catalyze among other things the formation of prostaglandins that act as messenger molecules in inflammation. Metabolic profiling has been shown to be a valuable tool to quantify nutritional metabolic homeostasis and disease mechanisms associated with metabolic stress and metabolic syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-KaddurahDaouk1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Naylor1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Yetukuri1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometric methods (LC-MS and GC-MS) were used to detect high and low abundant metabolites in plasma to obtain a comprehensive picture of metabolic changes induced by a mild anti-inflammatory drug intervention. A total of 343 plasma metabolites were quantified, of which 204 could be identified, spanning diverse chemical classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004525.s001">Table S1</xref>). The metabolic profiling approach was not only applied in fasting (homeostatic) conditions, but also at multiple time points during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). This approach is based on the concept that the resilience of the system can be assessed after challenging or perturbing a homeostatic situation. Plasma metabolic profiling combined with a glucose challenge has already been successfully used to differentiate between healthy individuals and individuals with an impaired glucose tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Shaham1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Applying a metabolic perturbation and metabolic profiling may help identify a set of metabolites that predict differences in the responses between treatment groups to the oral glucose tolerance test. A similar set of metabolites might then provide novel insight into the interplay between metabolic and inflammatory processes and provide candidate biomarkers to be applied in (intervention) studies aimed at lifestyle associated diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Centre of Utrecht (May 17, 2005).

This QC sample, prepared by pooling selected study samples, represents the full biochemical diversity of the study samples and allows the calculation of the analytical precision for all metabolites measured. The QC sample data is also used to correct systematic errors (e.g. batch to batch response differences) by a single point calibration model. Typically, this procedure offers excellent precision for a large majority of metabolites (e.g. 50&#x00025; of the metabolites have an RSD of less than 10&#x00025;, 75&#x00025; with an RSD less than 20&#x00025;). Metabolites with very high imprecision e.g. RSD&#x0003e;50&#x00025;, were removed from the data unless large differences between treatment groups were observed. Furthermore, method performance was carefully monitored using multiple internal standards (5 to 10 depending on method, including analogues, 2H and 13C labeled metabolites) and duplicate analysis of samples.

In identifying the key changes involved in the development of lifestyle associated diseases, experimental approaches have to deal with large inter-individual variety and the robustness of homeostasis. The current study deliberately recruited healthy overweight men with slightly increased inflammation parameters and successfully applied a relatively mild anti-inflammatory intervention so that only subtle changes were to be expected. The study authors aimed to demonstrate that an experimental design using metabolic profiling in concert with a challenge test is a good strategy for the unraveling of biomarkers in intervention studies where only subtle changes are to be expected.</p><p>The conventional metabolic profiling approach of measuring blood samples in fasting conditions &#x02013; even in a time course &#x02013; and the classical biomarkers (i.e. glucose, insulin, sialic acid, HOMA index, and adiponectin; van Erk et al, in prep) were not able to reveal changes in response to diclofenac treatment. In this study, the subtle metabolic changes resulting from diclofenac treatment could only be determined using an OGTT time course. This can have at least two reasons. Firstly, most of the treatment differences became significant by repeated confirmation of subtle homeostatic alterations in metabolite concentrations (metabolites with response type A) without dealing with any day-to-day variations like in the &#x02018;long-term&#x02019; fasted time course. Secondly, by perturbing a homeostatic metabolic situation, metabolite differences with a dynamic response to the oral glucose tolerance test became visible (response type B metabolites).</p><p>Diclofenac is known to inhibit and activate several enzymes and transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Boelsterli1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Ware1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. CD13 is a broad specificity aminopeptidase that cleaves specifically the N-terminal bound neutral amino acids from oligopeptides. The inhibition of the enzyme aminopeptidase N (CD13) by diclofenac corresponds to the lower plasma concentrations of several neutral amino acids such as L-isoleucine, L-threonine, and L-leucine. Such consistent lowering is reflected in a type A response.</p><p>In the current study, the diclofenac intervention applied was successfully shown by significantly reduced concentrations of PGE2 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>). Metabolic profiling revealed that the diclofenac treatment resulted in lower plasma levels of uric acid. Elevated serum uric acid levels are positively associated with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and diabetes type II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Becker1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Hayden1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> and has been proposed as risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Baker1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Johnson1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequently, elevated levels of uric acid are associated with inflammation and oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Becker1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Hayden1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Nakagawa1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. The current results suggest that inhibition of cyclooxygenase mediated inflammation (shown by significantly reduced concentrations of PGE2) could be associated with reduced concentrations of uric acid and therefore might lead to a reduction of risk on several metabolic diseases. However, this needs to be further explored.</p><p>Most interestingly in this study are the metabolites that showed a differential response between the treatments groups to the OGTT (metabolites identified with a response type B). All metabolites with response type B showed the largest difference between the treatments at time point 90 and/or 120 minutes after intake of glucose. Insulin peaks at an average of 65 minutes after glucose intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004525-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This suggests that differences in response to the OGTT may be attributed to the action of insulin.</p><fig id="pone-0004525-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004525.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Day 0 insulin response in OGTT time course.</title><p>Day 0 insulin mean response with standard error is shown in OGTT time course for all subjects.

Three of these - 5-oxoproline, glycine and glutamic acid - are known to be involved in the glutathione synthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004525-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, the response of other intermediates in the glutathione synthesis pathway was also studied. It appeared that glutathione and cysteinylglycine showed a similar dynamic response to the OGTT as the other type B responders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004525-g005">Figure 5</xref>), with the exception of plasma cysteine. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004525-g004">Figure 4</xref> provides and overview of the glutathione synthesis pathway and its relationship to glucose and insulin. Higher clearance of plasma L-5-oxoproline is known in case of lower GSH synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Yu1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. GSH synthesis is predominantly regulated by activity of &#x003b3;-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS) and availability of the rate-limiting substrate cysteine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Townsend1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, it is known that insulin action increases and glucose decreases the regulation of GSH synthesis by GCS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Townsend1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-Wu1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, the average plasma glutathione concentrations declined to their minimum concentration at 60 minutes after glucose intake and increased again at 90 to 120 minutes after glucose intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004525-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In the current study, the control group showed significant lower concentrations of glutathione synthesis pathway intermediates at 90 to 120 minutes after glucose intake compared to diclofenac treated subjects. This might indicate that diclofenac treatment resulted in a higher GSH synthesis response after the glucose bolus, which might be related to altered insulin signaling with diclofenac treatment. It has been shown earlier that a selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 results in increased insulin sensitivity in overweight or obese subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004525-GonzalezOrtiz1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. However, no differences were found in classical insulin sensitivity indexes (HOMA index, ISIcomp, MCRest and Gutt-index) between diclofenac and placebo treated subjects in this study. A possible explanation is that the combination of multiple metabolites as biomarker in concert with an oral glucose tolerance test allows for an earlier detection of changes in insulin sensitivity, however this is speculation at this stage and should be further explored.</p><fig id="pone-0004525-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004525.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Glutathione synthesis pathway and its connection to glucose and insulin.</title><p>High levels of glucose inhibit and high levels of insulin activate glutathione synthesis via the enzyme &#x003b3;-glutamylcysteine synthetase. <italic>Legend to </italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004525-g004"><italic>Figure 4</italic>:</xref> Connection arrows with color red represent inhibition and color green represent activation.
