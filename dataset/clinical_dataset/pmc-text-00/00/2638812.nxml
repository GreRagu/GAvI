We demonstrate a differential role between types of excitatory terminals. Structural and functional aspects of the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) synapses were studied in wild-type (WT) mice and in synapsin double-knockout mice (DKO). A severe reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles situated more than 100 nm away from the presynaptic membrane active zone was found in the synapsin DKO animals. The ultrastructural level gave concomitant reduction in F-actin immunoreactivity observed at the periactive endocytic zone of the MF terminals. Frequency facilitation was normal in synapsin DKO mice at low firing rates (&#x0223c;0.1 Hz) but was impaired at firing rates within the physiological range (&#x0223c;2 Hz). Synapses made by associational/commissural fibers showed comparatively small frequency facilitation at the same frequencies. Synapsin-dependent facilitation in MF synapses of WT mice was attenuated by blocking F-actin polymerization with cytochalasin B in hippocampal slices. Synapsin III, selectively seen in MF synapses, is enriched specifically in the area adjacent to the synaptic cleft. This may underlie the ability of synapsin III to promote synaptic depression, contributing to the reduced frequency facilitation observed in the absence of synapsins I and II.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>actin filaments</kwd><kwd>frequency facilitation</kwd><kwd>hippocampal synapses</kwd><kwd>immunoelectron microscopy</kwd><kwd>presynaptic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Short-term activity-induced synaptic plasticity depends in large part on highly dynamic synaptic vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greengard et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hilfiker et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>). It is believed that the synapsin family of phosphoproteins, encoded by 3 distinct genes each of which gives rises to several splice variants, is involved in the organization of vesicles in a majority of central synapses (see reviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kao et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hilfiker et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evergren et al. 2007</xref>).

Synapsin proteins are actin-nucleating agents and promote F-actin polymerization, thereby regulating cytoskeletal&#x02013;vesicle interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bahler and Greengard 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benfenati et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hilfiker et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shupliakov et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bloom et al. 2003</xref>). Other studies, however, have proposed additional functions, for example, involvement of synapsins in the regulation of vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hilfiker et al. 1998</xref>) and synaptic vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bloom et al. 2003</xref>), and the relative importance of these phenomena may vary in different populations of synapses, for example, excitatory versus inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gitler et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bogen et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hvalby et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kielland et al. 2006</xref>). Some central synapses have also been reported to lack synapsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kielland et al. 2006</xref>). To further address the question of the functional role of synapsins in central nervous system (CNS), we have examined glutamatergic signaling in 2 types of synapses with different morphological and short-term plasticity properties: terminals of hippocampal mossy fibers (MFs) and terminals formed by the recurrent associational/commissural (AC) collaterals, that is, the 2 principal synaptic pathways in hippocampus and parts of neuronal circuits controlling memory functions.</p><p>The MF originate from the granule cells in the dentate area and innervate the proximal pyramidal cell dendritic spines located in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blackstad and Kjaerheim 1961</xref>) with giant terminals, each containing 30&#x02013;40 vesicle clusters at active zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chicurel and Harris 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rollenhagen et al. 2007</xref>), with approximately 1400 RRP vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hallermann et al. 2003</xref>) and a total of approximately 10 000 cytoplasmic RP vesicles per terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bischofberger et al. 2006</xref>). These synapses have a unique ability to tune synaptic transmission to a wide range of firing frequencies, the prevailing physiological range being about 0.5&#x02013;4 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bischofberger et al. 2006</xref>), whereby responses can undergo a pronounced frequency facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Salin et al. 1996</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, very small terminals are formed by the AC collaterals, which derive from the CA3 pyramidal cells and terminate in both ipsilateral and contralateral CA1&#x02013;CA3 regions to form axospinous excitatory synapses on pyramidal cell dendrites, the ipsilateral collaterals to stratum radiatum of CA1 being known as Schaffer collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blackstad 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hjorth-Simonsen 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Witter et al. 2000</xref>). These small boutons, usually with one active zone, have 5&#x02013;10 RRP vesicles, about 80 vesicles in the recycling pool and a total of 100&#x02013;200 vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harris and Sultan 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schikorski and Stevens 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ryan et al. 2001</xref>). AC collateral synapses generally exhibit less marked frequency facilitation than MF giant synapses and tend to depress in response to prolonged trains of intermediate frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Salin et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nicoll and Schmitz 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hvalby et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>The functional importance of the synapsin proteins in these synapses remains unclear. Genetic ablation of synapsin I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takei et al. 1995</xref>) or synapsins I + II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spillane et al. 1995</xref>) changed neither baseline field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) nor long-term potentiation at MF&#x02013;CA3 pyramidal cell synapses. In contrast, genetic deletion of synapsins I + II led to strong response depression in the AC synapses in the CA1 stratum radiatum (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosahl et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hvalby et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jensen et al. 2007</xref>). The number of releasable vesicles in different terminals may be a limiting factor behind some of these effects, but other mechanisms may also contribute (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dobrunz and Stevens 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stevens and Wesseling 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delgado et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Millar et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zucker and Regehr 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bloom et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evergren et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jensen et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lisman et al. 2007</xref>). In the present study, we focused on possible involvement of actin and synapsin in glutamate release in MF and AC terminals. Experiments were performed in wild-type (WT) and synapsin I + II double-knockout (DKO) mice. Perturbation of actin filament formation was induced by the F-actin severing agent, cytochalasin B. Our results indicate that the strong and prolonged frequency facilitation induced by the MF terminals at physiological stimulation frequencies consists of 2 parts, one of which is strongly synapsin and F-actin dependent. In contrast, the AC synapses showed small and almost synapsin- and actin-independent frequency facilitation.

Briefly, specimens (typically 0.5 &#x000d7; 0.5 &#x000d7; 1 mm) from hippocampus were cryoprotected by immersion in graded concentrations of glycerol (10%, 20%, and 30%) in 0.1 M NaPi for 30 min at each step and then overnight in 30% glycerol in 0.1 M NaPi overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. Samples were then plunged into liquid propane cooled at &#x02212;190 &#x000b0;C by liquid nitrogen in a Universal Cryofixation System KF80 (Reichert-Jung, Vienna, Austria). Tissue blocks were moved by a precooled forceps. For freeze substitution, tissue samples were immersed in a solution of 0.5% uranyl acetate in anhydrous methanol and kept overnight at &#x02212;90 &#x000b0;C. The temperature was raised stepwise in 4 &#x000b0;C increments per hour from &#x02212;90 to &#x02212;45 &#x000b0;C, where it was kept for the subsequent steps. Thereafter, tissue samples were washed several times with anhydrous methanol to remove residual water and uranyl acetate. The infiltration in Lowicryl HM20 (Polysciences, Washington, PA) went stepwise from Lowicryl:methanol 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1 (1 h each) to pure Lowicryl (overnight). For polymerization, the tissue was placed in a precooled embedding mall and exposed to ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 360 nm for 2 days at &#x02212;45 &#x000b0;C followed by 1 day at room temperature. Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were cut with a diamond knife on a Reichert-Jung ultramicrotome and mounted on nickel grids using an adhesive pen (David Sangyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec><title>Slice Preparations</title><p>In order to determine the ultrastructure of the MF and AC synapses following experimental manipulations, slice preparations were analyzed following exposure to high [KCl] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wickelgren et al. 1985</xref>) and in the absence or presence of cytochalasin B. Adult WT or synapsin DKO animals were sacrificed with the general anesthetic desflurane (Suprane, Baxter), the brains were removed, and transverse slices (400 &#x003bc;m) were cut from the middle portion of each hippocampus with a vibroslicer in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, 4 &#x000b0;C, bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;5% CO<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.25 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 12 glucose. Slices were placed in a humidified interface chamber at 28&#x02013;32 &#x000b0;C and perfused with ACSF containing 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Slices from both genotypes were divided into 4 groups (3 mice per group), with groups 1 and 2 kept in normal ACSF, whereas groups 3 and 4 were kept in ACSF containing cytochalasin B (20 &#x003bc;M). Synaptic efficacy in the slices during incubations was characterized by continuous monitoring of fEPSPs (0.1-Hz test stimulation) in the CA3-to-CA1 stratum radiatum AC synapse as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hvalby et al. 2006</xref>). Following equilibration with or without cytochalasin B, slices from groups 2 and 4 were subjected to 30 mM KCl added to the perfusing medium.</p><p>When correlative analyses of these slices were performed after electrophysiological stimuli and recordings, they were treated as above, only they were fixed in 4% PFA and 2.5% GA, rinsed in NaPi, then treated with 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> in 0.1 M NaPi, dehydrated in graded ethanol followed by propylene oxide, and embedded in Durcupan (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative Electron Microscopic Vesicle Analyses</title><p>Ultrathin sections covering the CA1 region and the dentate gyrus including the hilus or covering the CA3 region were contrasted with uranyl acetate (5% in 40% ethanol) and lead citrate (0.3%), and digital pictures of AC terminals in CA1 (Schaffer collaterals) and MF terminals either in the hilus (perfusion-fixed material) or in the stratum lucidum of CA3 (acute slices) were taken at a primary magnification of 11 000&#x02013;26 500&#x000d7; (at least 20 pictures per area per animal), in a Philips CM 100 or a Tecnai 12 FEI electron microscope, both equipped with digital cameras. The MF terminals were identified based on size, presence of clearly defined asymmetrical synapses, and the specific protrusion of dendritic spines into the larger terminals. The AC terminals were identified by having asymmetrical synapses and by location onto dendritic spines situated close to apical dendrites in the stratum radiatum region.</p><p>For analyses of vesicle density, the distance from each vesicle to the presynaptic membrane, opposed to a postsynaptic density, was determined. This was done by recording the Cartesian coordinates of the vesicle centers that were then used to automatically calculate vesicle densities within given distances from the synapse. Calculations were performed as follows: a second-degree polynomial equation for the presynaptic membrane was constructed, representing a parabola, using 3 known coordinates that were along the synaptic cleft and in the active zone. To find the minimum distance between a point marked at the center of each vesicle and the parabola representing the presynaptic membrane, a second function describing this distance was constructed (eq. 1):<disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="cercorbhn101fx1_ht.jpg"/></disp-formula>where <italic>x</italic> and <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) are the coordinates for a point along the parabola, and <italic>p</italic> and <italic>q</italic> are the vesicle coordinates. The minimum distance was found where the derivative of equation (1) was equal to zero, using a Maple (Waterloo Maple, Ontario, Canada) plug-in for Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). A line between the ends of the postsynaptic density was used to construct a perpendicular lateral limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). The area was determined by the distance between the 2 lateral limits and by grouping the distances into bins of 50 nm. Areas occupied by organelles other than synaptic vesicles (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane) or outside the terminal were excluded. Also, the vesicles were grouped into the distances 0&#x02013;100 nm and 100&#x02013;400/500 nm as stated in the figure legends. Albeit not the same as the functionally defined vesicle pools RRP and RP, this grouping is thought to reflect these areas. If more than one synapse was within the same terminal, they were analyzed by first defining both the RRPs and then splitting the RP between the 2 if they overlapped.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Vesicular densityin MF and AC terminals of synapsin WT and DKO mice.

Previous studies indicated that the MF-to-CA3 pyramid synapses in the hippocampus displayed major structural changes but retained functional characteristics following genetic ablation of synapsins I and/or II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spillane et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takei et al. 1995</xref>). There may, however, be diversity among different nerve terminals. Thus, retinogeniculate terminals seem to lack these synapsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kielland et al. 2006</xref>), and there are divergent reports on the effect of perturbation of actin in distinct preparations of cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ryan et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sankaranarayanan et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darcy et al. 2006</xref>). Synaptic activity is associated with the formation of actin filaments at the periactive zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bloom et al. 2003</xref>). The resulting scaffold may be more important in large than in small terminals. The MF synapses are unique by their large size and wide dynamic range of firing. The present study reports novel aspects of structure and function that are highly regulated by synapsins I + II and actin filaments in these giant excitatory terminals, compared with AC terminals, the major class of small excitatory terminals in the region.</p><sec><title>Reduction of Vesicle Density in the RP of Synapsin DKO Mice</title><p>In the MF terminals, the density of vesicles in synapsin DKO mice is significantly reduced within areas farther than 100 nm away from the active zone of the presynaptic terminal, that is, in the RP of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pieribone et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashton and Ushkaryov 2005</xref>). A similarly pronounced reduction was not seen in the terminals of the AC collaterals, suggesting that in this regard the MF synapses are distinct from AC terminals.</p><p>The stability of the cytoplasmic vesicle clusters may primarily depend on synapsin-mediated associations between the synaptic vesicles within the clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pieribone et al. 1995</xref>). Hence, in terminals devoid of synapsins I + II, the cytoplasmic vesicle clusters would be expected to be decreased in size, vesicle numbers, or vesicle densities. Our data agree with this prediction. As the effect was observed in acute brain slices as well as in tissue that was perfusion fixed under deep barbiturate anesthesia, it is presumably present in basal conditions. There was no further reduction in the cytoplasmic cluster of vesicles upon potassium stimulation, suggesting that the endocytic recovery of vesicles is keeping pace with exocytosis under these conditions.</p><p>Strong frequency facilitation is known to occur in the MF during prolonged stimulus trains at both 0.5- and 2-Hz stimulation frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Salin et al. 1996</xref>), probably reflecting, at least in part, the mobilization and translocation of synaptic vesicles from the cytoplasmic vesicle clusters into the RRP. Our data suggest that this frequency facilitation derives from 2 distinct pools, based on the observation that the major part of the facilitation, representing approximately 60% of the maximal response at 2 Hz, was not seen in the synapsin DKO and, therefore, must represent vesicles recruited to the releasable pool by a synapsin I + II&#x02013;dependent mechanism. Interestingly, this part of the frequency facilitation, previously not described, also depends on the presence of F-actin filaments because interfering with either synapsin or F-actin occluded the response in a similar fashion. Thus, our data suggest that these proteins may share mechanisms of action during frequency facilitation.</p><p>These data are in general agreement with previous studies on vesicle clusters, most of which indicate that the clusters are stabilized by synapsin cross-linking vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pieribone et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Awizio et al. 2007</xref>), whereas vesicle mobilization processes require cycling of actin microfilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sakaba and Neher 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashton and Ushkaryov 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jensen et al. 2007</xref>). In contrast, the synapsin-independent part of the frequency facilitation occurring in the synapsin DKO at 2 Hz, which represented approximately 40% of the maximum response enhancement occurring in the WT, was not sensitive to F-actin depolymerization. This latter response pattern may rather represent equilibrium between vesicle recruitment and exocytosis that does not involve synapsin- or actin-dependent recruitment mechanisms.</p><p>Our study also indicates that the synaptic response enhancement that is dependent on synapsin and F-actin is transient, since after the peak occurring at 30 s, the fEPSP decreased steadily for at least 15 min. Interestingly, activity of MFs at different frequencies entrains distinct network consequences: low-frequency stimulation of granule cells induces MF-mediated synaptic inhibition of target CA3 cells, whereas high-frequency stimulations induce monosynaptic excitatory CA3 pyramidal cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mori et al. 2004</xref>). The differential recruitment of these pathways possibly reflects distinct patterns of frequency-dependent facilitation at giant MF synapses, which terminate on pyramidal neurons, whereas small synapses made by filopodia-like extensions terminate on inhibitory interneurons in CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acsady et al. 1998</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the MF synapse, the small AC collateral synapse located on more distal parts of CA3 pyramidal cell apical dendrites did not respond to similar stimulus trains with strong frequency facilitation. Correspondingly, AC collateral synapses showed only minor changes in the synapsin DKO mice, further emphasizing the differences between the giant MF and the small AC terminals.</p><p>Moreover, following KCl treatment of slices, F-actin immunoreactivity at the periactive zones, where endocytosis takes place, was significantly reduced in the MF synapses in the synapsin DKO compared with WT. No such reduction occurred in the AC synapses. Hence, F-actin and synapsin interaction may be more important during recycling of synaptic vesicles in the giant MF synapse than in the small AC synapse. Stimulus-induced frequency facilitation occurring at 2 Hz in the CA3-to-CA1 AC synapse is negatively regulated by synapsins I + II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hvalby et al. 2006</xref>). In the CA3-to-CA3 AC synapse examined here, the small frequency facilitation observed showed a brief, transient constraining effect of synapsins I + II. This is in stark contrast to the synapsin-dependent facilitation at the MF synapse, indicating a major difference in functional organization between these synapses.</p><p>Stimulation-induced changes in morphology were searched for in slices exposed to a high extracellular potassium concentration. In the WT, no effects on cytoplasmic vesicle clusters were seen after prolonged KCl treatment. This suggests that this synapse has a very efficient mechanism for synaptic vesicle recycling. A similar phenomenon was observed in synapses established by primary afferents in the lamprey spinal cord that display tonic firing pattern and that contain more synapsin per synaptic vesicle than reticulospinal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evergren et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>Because our results suggest that the frequency facilitation at low-to-moderate firing frequencies that appears to be a unique feature of the MF&#x02013;CA3 synapse is synapsin and actin dependent, this type of frequency facilitation may reflect the mobilization of synaptic vesicles from the RP to the RRP. In contrast, the AC synapses terminating onto CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jensen et al. 2007</xref>) and CA3 pyramidal cells do not show this form of plasticity. This is in line with recent observations indicating that excitatory synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cells, during stimulation at increased frequency are largely dependent on fast refilling of synaptic vesicles, rather than mobilization of reserve vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ertunc et al. 2007</xref>). Of special interest are the frequency-dependent responses on the MF synapses. Although the prevailing physiologic firing frequency of MF is around 0.5&#x02013;4 Hz, the large size of the vesicle clusters in the MF terminals suggests that these terminals should be able to respond to high-frequency stimulations. In agreement, the firing frequency of MF can increase to &#x0003e;40 Hz when place cells in the dentate area become activated by spatial coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mori et al. 2004</xref>), suggesting that these represent conditions in which vesicles are recruited from the large RP in the MF.</p></sec><sec><title>F-Actin Destabilization Normalizes the RP of Vesicles in Synapsin I + II&#x02013;Deficient MF Terminals</title><p>Treatment of synapsin DKO slices with cytochalasin B abolished the reduction in cytoplasmic synaptic vesicle density that has been reported in synapsin-deficient MF terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takei et al. 1995</xref> and this study). Moreover, this effect was due to an increase in vesicle density back to normal levels in the synapsin DKO and not to a decrease in vesicle density in the WT. Hence, we suggest that the decrease in synaptic vesicle density following synapsin I + II perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosahl et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gitler et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bogen et al. 2006</xref>) may be F-actin dependent. Because recent studies show that synaptic vesicles may migrate between individual hippocampal boutons in an actin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darcy et al. 2006</xref>), it appears probable that increased vesicle mobility caused by the absence of synapsins may be counteracted by destabilizing actin. Interestingly, the increase of cytoplasmic synaptic vesicle clusters in the synapsin DKO terminals after cytochalasin B treatment did not rescue the lost synapsin-dependent frequency facilitation. This suggests that at the physiological 2-Hz frequency, synapsin proteins are required to support vesicle recruitment from cytoplasmic vesicle clusters into the releasable vesicle pool, irrespective of the number of vesicles available in the RP.</p></sec><sec><title>Lack of Decrease in Vesicle Density in the AC Terminals</title><p>Whereas we found only minor changes in AC terminals, substantial reductions in the number of synaptic vesicles, both in the cytoplasmic region and in areas close to the presynaptic membrane of AC terminals, have been described earlier in studies of synapsin DKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosahl et al. 1995</xref>). Recently, major decreases restricted to the cytoplasmic vesicle clusters were reported in a study using high-pressure freezing and cryosubstitution of CA1 slices from synapsin I + II + III triple knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Siksou et al. 2007</xref>). The recent finding that a phosphoprotein different from synapsins regulates vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaffield and Betz 2007</xref>) may contribute to discrepancies between studies on synapsin knockout. To what extent these discrepancies could be due to different experimental setup, including possible differences in the genetic background of the knockout mice, remains unknown. Because our experiments gave highly reproducible observations of reduced MF vesicle density in the synapsin DKO compared with WT preparations, they cannot be ascribed to random preparation artifacts. The important point is that the changes are larger in MF, indicative of a higher synapsin I + II dependence of the cytoplasmic pool of vesicles in the MF terminals compared with AC terminals.</p></sec><sec><title>Synapsin III Localization</title><p>It remains possible that the selective decrease of synaptic vesicles seen in the MF terminals could be related to the selective expression of synapsin III in the granule cells and their axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pieribone et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kao et al. 2008</xref>). Whereas synapsins I and II in adult animals are relatively uniformly distributed among different classes of nerve endings, synapsin III shows a highly restricted distribution, being present in inter alia the MF, where the content of synapsin III remains unchanged in the synapsins I + II DKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pieribone et al. 2002</xref>). Given the restrictive effect of synapsin III on the size of the recycling pool of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al. 2002</xref>) in the absence of synapsins I and II, the presence of synapsin III may partly explain the observed reduction of the RP of vesicles in MF. Moreover, the association of synapsin III with the RRP vesicle in MF that we observe may possibly underlie the ability of synapsin III to promote the response depression induced by high-frequency stimulation and the reduction of mEPSP size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al. 2002</xref>). Taken together, these effects could contribute to the unique dynamic range of the MF synapse and the loss of frequency facilitation in synapsin I + II DKO.</p><p>In studies of the localization of synapsin III, it has been shown that synapsin III antibodies labels strongly distinct areas within the brain. In mouse hippocampus, the most intense synapsin III labeling is confined to the subgranular layer of area dentata, extending into the hilus and covering a region rich in MF terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pieribone et al. 2002</xref>). In the same study, the authors propose that synapsin III is concentrated over vesicle clusters in MF terminals. Also, the same article shows that labeling with synapsin panspecific G304 antibody, the same antibody used in this article, on synapsin I + II DKO mice gives identical staining pattern as if WT mice is stained using synapsin III antibody. Our findings, using electron microscopy, that synapsin III is enriched in the RRP, add to what has previously been reported. In the synapsin DKO mice where the synapsin III labeling is demonstrated, there are a reduced number of vesicles in the clusters; hence, we cannot rule out the theory proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pieribone et al. (2002)</xref> that synapsin III is found in vesicle clusters. However, we have analyzed a total of 100 MF terminals in 5 DKO mice without seeing much synapsin III labeling in the RP. In contrast, the labeling in the RRP was significantly enriched compared with RP, also when it was corrected for vesicle density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3<italic>G</italic></xref>). Based on these findings, it appears possible that synapsin III could have a specific functional role restricted to the RRP of MF terminals.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the regulation of the synaptic vesicle cycle in the giant MF synapse is dependent on synapsins I + II and F-actin. Trafficking of vesicles in AC synapses is less dependent on synapsins and actin. This further supports the idea that different mechanisms may control the cycling of vesicles in synapses established by different populations of neurons in the CNS and in synapses displaying different structural and functional properties. In addition, we show that synapsin III has a highly specific localization in MF terminals, possibly contributing to the unique properties of these synapses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><grant-sponsor>The Norwegian Research Council; the Swedish Research Council</grant-sponsor> (grant <grant-num>13473-06A to OS</grant-num>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr P.
