A six-year-old boy who was a known case of DHPD deficiency and bornof a consanguineous marriage presented to our clinic with non-healing corneal ulcers in both eyes. Reduced corneal sensationswere detected and the patient was started on lubricating eyedrops. The patient continues to be on lubricant eye drops andthere has been no recurrence of the disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dihydroxypyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency</kwd><kwd>neurotrophic keratitis</kwd><kwd>pyrimidine metabolism disorders</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Dihydroxypyrimidine dehydrogenase (DHPD) deficiency isa rare metabolic disease. The patient usually presents in earlyinfancy with features of cerebral dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Though otherocular manifestations have been reported, to our knowledgecorneal involvement has not been documented in the past.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>This is the first case report of DHPD deficiency with cornealinvolvement.</p><sec sec-type=""><title>Case History</title><p>An 18-day-old baby with failure to thrive was referred toour clinic for eye examination. The patient was born ofa consanguineous marriage. His parents were first cousins.At birth he was lethargic with poor cry and feeble suck. Hehad bilateral hydrocele and large anterior fontanelle.He was investigated for possible metabolic diseases. Bloodinvestigations included total and differential blood count,blood sugar, serum electrolytes, serum ammonia, serumlactate, serum pyruvate, liver enzymes, thyroid function testsand arterial blood gases. Urine was tested for pH, ketones,odor and reducing substances. Karyotyping with G-bandingstudies was also performed. Though all above investigationswere within normal range urine gas chromatography showedincreased thiamine and uracil levels. Fibroblast culturesindicated deletion of the DHPD gene and diagnosis of DHPDdeficiency was made. His elder brother was homozygous for themutation and excreted increased amount of thiamine and uracilin urine; however, he was clinically asymptomatic. His eldestsister has two normal alleles but his mother was heterozygousfor the condition.</p><p>Ocular assessment at that time did not detect anypathology. On subsequent follow-up his vision was foundto be reduced to 20/100 (Cardiff Acuity Cards). Ophthalmicexamination under general anesthesia was essentiallynormal apart from astigmatism in both eyes. Glasses wereprescribed with orthoptic follow-up. At the age of six yearshis visual acuities deteriorated to 20/200 and 20/120 (SheridanGardner) in the right and left eye respectively. Bilateral centralcorneal opacities were noticed along with peripheral cornealvascularization. He subsequently developed recurrent cornealepithelial defects [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>]. Schirmer&#x02032;s Test revealed normaltear secretion. An initial diagnosis of exposure keratopathywas made.</p><p>However, on subsequent follow-up, he was found to havemarkedly reduced corneal sensations and a revised diagnosisof neurotrophic keratitis was made. For the last three yearshis vision has remained unchanged and his eyes have beenmanaged satisfactorily with ocular lubricants with no furtherrecurrence of the corneal epithelial defects [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Discussion</title><p>The DHPD enzyme is the rate-limiting step in the metabolismof pyrimidine bases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> It catalyses the first step in the conversionof thymine and uracil to beta-aminobutyric acid and beta-alanine respectively [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>]. Partial or total deficiency leads toincreased accumulation of thymine and uracil in the serum aswell as cerebrospinal fluid. Excess bases are also excreted inthe urine. The cause for the neurological deficit is still unclear.It has been postulated that the DHPD enzyme is required forthe synthesis of beta alanine, which is a neurotransmitter inthe brain. This may explain the reduced corneal sensationand the development of neurotrophic keratitis in this child.Various manifestations associated with DHPD deficiencyhave been described, but most children present withmicrocephaly, epilepsy and abnormal EEG profile, however,many may be asymptomatic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> Ocular manifestations such asmicrophthalmia, choroidal coloboma and nystagmus havealso been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>The condition has attracted interest in the recent years asthe DHPD enzyme is also the initial step for the metabolism ofwidely used anti-neoplastic drug 5 Fluorouracil. Severe toxicity,including death, following administration of 5 Fluorouracil wasreported in patients with DHPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Sann&#x02032;a</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Kuilenberg</surname><given-names>AB</given-names></name><name><surname>Atrak</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name><name><surname>Abdul-Jabbar</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Gennip</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiencypresenting at birth</article-title><source>J Inherit Metab Dis</source><year>2005</year><volume>28</volume><fpage>793</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16151913</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bakker</surname><given-names>HD</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubio Guzalbo</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>van Gennip</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dihydropyrimidinedehydrogenase deficiency presenting with psychomotorretardation and ocular abnormalities</article-title><source>J Inherit Metab Dis</source><year>1994</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>640</fpage><lpage>1</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7837779</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ezzeldin</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Fourie</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Diasio</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dihydropyrimidinedehydrogenase deficiency: Impact of pharmacogenetics on5-Fluorouracil therapy</article-title><source>Clin Adv Hematol Oncol</source><year>2004</year><volume>8</volume><fpage>527</fpage><lpage>32</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16163233</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Hofmann</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Kohlmuller</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Murdter</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Zanger</surname><given-names>UM</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwab</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Comprehensive analysis of pyrimidine metabolismin 450 children with unspecified neurological symptoms usinghigh pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisationtandem mass spectrometry</article-title><source>J Inherit Metab Dis</source><year>2005</year><volume>28</volume><fpage>1109</fpage><lpage>22</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16435204</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back><floats-group><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Central epithelial defect</p></caption><alt-text>Figure 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="IndianJOphthalmol-56-336-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Healed epithelial defect</p></caption><alt-text>Figure 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="IndianJOphthalmol-56-336-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Biochemical pathway of thymine and uracil catabolism</p></caption><alt-text>Figure 3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="IndianJOphthalmol-56-336-g003"/></fig></floats-group></article>
