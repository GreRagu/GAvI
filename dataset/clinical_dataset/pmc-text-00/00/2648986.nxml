A genome-wide quantitative portrait of each individual NFR, with their starting and ending positions, lengths, and degrees of nucleosome depletion is critical for revealing the heterogeneity of gene regulation and chromatin organization. By averaging nucleosome occupancy levels, previous studies have identified the presence of NFRs in the promoter regions across many genes. However, evaluation of the quantitative characteristics of individual NFRs requires an NFR calling method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p>In this study, we propose a statistical method to identify the patterns of NFRs from a genome-wide measurement of nucleosome occupancy. This method is based on an appropriately designed segmental semi-Markov model, which can capture each NFR pattern and output its quantitative characterizations. Our results show that the majority of the NFRs are located in intergenic regions or promoters with a length of about 400&#x02013;600bp and varying degrees of nucleosome depletion. Our quantitative NFR mapping allows for an investigation of the relative impacts of transcription machinery and DNA sequence in evicting histones from NFRs.

First, it is not clear whether NFRs occur exclusively at the promoter regions. NFRs in non-promoter regions (including coding regions) may have functions that have not been identified. Second, it has been controversial whether histones are depleted only from the promoters of activated genes. Several studies suggested the existence of transcription-independent NFRs at individual promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Lee3">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Sekinger1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, the transcriptional machinery and DNA sequence have been shown to be involved in histone eviction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Mai1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Segal1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, however, they may have distinct effects for different subtypes of NFRs</p><p>To investigate the above issues, it is important to bring out the dynamic aspects of NFRs. Due to the complex interplay between gene regulation and chromatin remodeling, the lengths of NFRs may differ from one another. Likewise, the degree of nucleosome depletion (DoND) in each NFR is likely to vary as well. However, while many previous studies have described nucleosome occupancy in quantitative terms, most of them focused on ensemble properties of NFRs. For instance, representative nucleosome occupancy in the promoter regions have been reported by averaging the enrichments of nucleosomes across all genes aligned by the start codons of ORFs or transcription start sites (TSSs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Yuan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Lee2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Although this &#x0201c;representative NFR&#x0201d; reveals a shared pattern of nucleosome depletion for many genes, it also masks characteristics specific for individual NFRs. On the other hand, reports such as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004721-g004">Fig. 4</xref> of Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Lee2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004721-g002">Fig. 2</xref> of Whitehouse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Kim1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> did indicate length variation among NFRs. However, the location and quantitative features of each individual NFR have not been systematically explored.</p><p>In order to examine an individual NFR across the whole genome, an automatic &#x0201c;NFR calling&#x0201d; algorithm is required that can dissect an NFR pattern from a noisy background. Currently the major existing algorithms facilitating the analysis of genome-wide DNA-protein interaction data were adapted from those initially designed for detecting the binding of transcription factors (TFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Cawley1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Johnson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These algorithms are however inadequate for capturing NFRs for the following reasons: first, as most TFs are sparsely localized across the genome, many algorithms for identifying TF binding sites (TFBSs) are designed under the assumption that TF binding is an uncommon event, thus the majority of array data is considered background noise. However, this assumption becomes problematic for exploring epigenetic events that are often abundant, including the occupancy of nucleosomes and a variety of histone modifications. Second, the signal of TF binding obtained from microarrays typically occurs within a short region and tends to form a sharp &#x0201c;peak&#x0201d; (Supplementary Figure 1a in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>). In contrast, the pattern of nucleosome occupancy or the occurrence of histone modifications can be much longer with various lengths (Supplementary Figure 1b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>). Third, while the binding of a TF at a promoter only requires a qualitative description (i.e. presence/absence), quantitative characterizations such as the DoND are essential for NFRs.</p><p>To our knowledge, there are only two published algorithms specifically designed for detecting the presence of nucleosomes. Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Yuan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> employed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to characterize positioned or delocalized nucleosomes. This algorithm was further modified to analyze higher resolution nucleosome occupancy data by Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Lee2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. This method only infers the positions of nucleosomes, but does not provide quantitative properties of the NFRs such as DoND. Alternatively, Ozsolak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Ozsolak1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> proposed a two-step procedure to detect positioned nucleosomes, consisting mainly of (1) smoothing the raw probe-level data by wavelet decomposition and (2) decomposing the entire chromosome into &#x0201c;peaks&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;troughs&#x0201d; by an edge-detection technique. A peak-to-trough ratio was used to quantify the signal of nucleosome occupancy, which is a conservative measurement since it is estimated using only a few extreme values. As Ozsolak et al. mentioned in their supplementary methods &#x0201c;This method gives a very conservative definition of peak and trough heights and eliminates many false positives&#x0201d;.</p><p>In this study, we developed an algorithm for capturing complex signal patterns from high-density genome-wide data. This algorithm is based on a segmental semi-Markov model (SSMM) which is an extension of HMM. In addition to identifying desired patterns (e.g., NFR patterns) and capturing their quantitative features, our algorithm also enjoys more flexible model assumptions and higher efficiency compared to regular HMM. A schematic representation of our study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004721-g001">Figure 1</xref>, depicting how SSMM is used in characterizing genome-wide NFRs and exploring the driving forces of nucleosome depletion.</p><fig id="pone-0004721-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004721.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A schematic representation of our study.</title><p>A flow chart is shown to illustrate the experimental and computational strategies employed in this study.

Here we carried out a systematic study for average nucleosome occupancy on all annotated chromosome features, including ORFs, ARSs, rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs, snoRNAs, telomeric elements, introns, long terminal repeats and transposons. Specifically, We measure the nucleosome occupancy in one chromosome feature, e.g., ORF, by the log ratio (the ChIP enriched signals versus the signals from genomic control) averaged across all the instances of the chromosome feature, e.g., all individual ORFs. Our findings reveal that ORFs, transposons, rRNAs, telomeres (except the telomeric repeats where there is presumably no histone binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Wright1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>) have higher nucleosome occupancy on average than intergenic regions.

Interestingly, introns and ARSs also have low nucleosome occupancy (Supplementary Table 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>NFR identification by SSMM</title><p>In order to examine individual NFR across the whole genome, we developed an automatic &#x0201c;NFR calling&#x0201d; algorithm based on a segmental semi-Markov model (SSMM) to capture the quantitative properties of each NFR.

States 1 and 2, represented by two horizontal lines, reflect signals from a nucleosome occupied region (NOR) and an NFR, respectively. These two states have the same shape, but different state duration and transition probabilities. State 3, represented by a line with negative slope, models the transition from the NOR to the NFR; and state 4, represented by a line with positive slope, models the transition from the NFR to the NOR.

We found a total of 3448 NFRs at the promoter regions of 3447 distinct genes (within 500 upstream of ORFs), among which we obtained the TSS positions for 2601 ORFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-David1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with the aforementioned literature, the centers of these NFRs were found to lie around 100&#x02013;200bp upstream of the TSS.

We conclude that NFRs have a typical length of 400&#x02013;600bp, which is approximately the length of DNA wrapping around two-to-three nucleosomes plus linkers.

However, the relative effects of these two factors and their relationship remain unclear. We sought to address these questions based on the NFRs identified by our SSMM.</p><p>For each NFR, we first quantified the levels of transcriptional activity and DNA affinity for histones. To measure the transcriptional activity, a genome-wide RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) binding assay was performed using ChIP-chip (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We found that the DoND of NFRs correlates best with the Pol II binding levels within the neighboring regions of NFRs rather than those within the NFRs (Supplementary Tables 5&#x02013;6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>). Presumably this is because NFRs typically occur at gene promoters, while the strongest Pol II binding mostly occurs on the neighboring coding regions, which could be either upstream or downstream of NFRs. Based on this observation, we averaged the Pol II binding signal within 1kb upstream or downstream of an NFR, and defined the higher signal as the local transcriptional activity. To measure the DNA affinity for histones within an NFR, we computed the average DNA affinity (measured as a probability of nucleosome occupancy) across all the nucleotides in that NFR using a previously published data set <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Segal1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Next, in order to examine the contributions of transcriptional activity and DNA affinity in nucleosome depletion, we used a bivariate additive linear model with DoND (either absolute depletion or relative depletion) as a response and the two factors as covariates. The contribution of each factor is evaluated based on the variance of DoND it explains. It is worth noting that the linear regression and correlation analysis, as powerful tools to estimate the relative effect of different factors, however cannot be simply regarded as causal inference. Specifically, the variance of DoND is decomposed into three parts: the variance explained by DNA affinity, the variance explained by Pol II binding, and the covariance. We observed a positive covariance in all cases we considered and we referred to this covariance as the variance explained by both factors (See section 6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref> for details).</p><p>Initial examination of the entire 9593 NFRs by our additive bivariate linear model confirmed that both factors have significant effects on nucleosome depletion in NFRs, while the effect of transcriptional activity is dominant overall (Supplementary Table 6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>). For example, if we use absolute depletion to measure DoND, 12.6&#x00025; of the DoND variance in total can be explained by either DNA affinity for histones or transcriptional activity, among which the majority (90.4&#x00025;) is attributed to transcriptional activity. Only 7.6&#x00025; is attributed to DNA affinity for histones, and less than 2&#x00025; can be explained by either factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004721-g009">Figure 9</xref>, see Supplementary Table 10 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref> for details).

(1) While both Pol II and DNA affinity affect DoND in intergenic/promoter regions as expected, Pol II has an overall larger effect than DNA affinity, indicating that Pol II is a major deterministic factor of nucleosome depletion in intergenic/promoter regions. (2) Pol II binding explains more variance of DoND in regions with higher transcription activity, such as divergent and tandem intergenic regions. In contrast, DNA affinity has a larger effect in regions with less transcription activity such as convergent intergenic regions (Supplementary Tables 10&#x02013;11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>). For example, when relative depletion is used as the measurement of DoND, DNA affinity contributes to 9&#x00025;, 24.4&#x00025;, and 78.7&#x00025; of the total variance explained by the two factors in divergent, tandem, and convergent intergenic regions, respectively (Supplementary Table 11). (3) DNA affinity effect increases dramatically in NFRs containing TATA box or TFBS. For example, the contribution of DNA affinity increases 28 times more in TFBS-containing NFRs than in TFBS-less NFRs, and 6 times more in NFRs within TATA-containing promoters than TATA-less promoters (using absolute depletion, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004721-g009">Figure 9</xref> and Supplementary Table 10 for details). In contrast, the Pol II binding effect remains comparable (less than 2 fold change) regardless of the presence of TFBS or TATA-box (Supplementary Table 10 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>). Using relative depletion yields similar results (Supplementary Table 11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>). Interestingly, among those TFBS or TATA box-containing genes where DoND are dominated by DNA sequence properties, a number of them are stress response genes. For example, <italic>GAC1</italic> is a gene that is repressed in rich medium and induced upon diauxic transition when glucose is limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Parrou1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. We found <italic>GAC1</italic> is depleted of nucleosomes at its promoter under a repressive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004721-g010">Figure 10</xref>). <italic>YMR279C</italic>, a gene that is activated upon heat stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Sakaki1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and also loses histones from its promoter despite the fact that it is not transcribed (Supplementary Figure 19 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>). Both promoter regions of these genes have been predicted to contain sequences that are poorly bound by nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Segal1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, this may be a general phenomenon as it has been reported that TATA-box containing genes are highly enriched by stress-response genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Basehoar1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The DNA sequences in the promoters of these genes could have evolved to enable strong repulsion against histones. In this way histones may be pre-cleared at these promoters prior to the entry of transcription machinery, presumably to allow the rapid binding of TBP (TATA-box binding protein) under environmental stresses. A similar mechanism could apply to TFBS-containing genes. Indeed, the low nucleosome occupancy on TATA-box has been reported to be encoded by the intrinsic properties of DNA sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Segal1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Ioshikhes1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have applied this algorithm to a genome-wide nucleosome occupancy data and identified all NFRs across the entire yeast genome at 4bp high resolution.

Among them, 52 are associated with tRNA genes, presumably due to their high transcription rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Basehoar1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition there are 16 NFRs falling into ARS regions, which raises an interesting possibility for the involvement of NFRs in DNA replications. We also found 58 NFRs lie in 58 distinct ORFs (25 verified ORFs, see Supplementary Table 13 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>; 12 uncharacterized and 21 dubious ORFs, see Supplementary Table 14 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>). It is possible that these genic NFRs may harbor regulatory regions for the neighboring genes that are located more than 500bp away. Alternatively, these NFRs could affect genes in which they reside. For example, they may contain cryptic transcription start sites within coding regions allowing transcription to initiate there under certain conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Ioshikhes1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Xu1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore our study highlights the need for further study towards the functional roles of NFRs within genic regions.</p><p>It is also worth noting that our methodology is not limited to the tiling array based NFR study as demonstrated above. The generality of our method allows for flexible applications to other high-throughput data in computational biology that may exhibit segmental patterns. For example, SSMM can be applied to the nucleosome occupancy data generated using micrococcal nuclease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Lee2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> or ChIP-seq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Fascher1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> after appropriate smoothing. Moreover, our method also allows the choice of different segmental models depending on research interests, which make it general enough to be adapted for analyzing many other types of genomic data including those for DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Gunjan1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Ostendorf1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> and chromosome translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Krogh1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Eddy1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>ChIP-chip assay and data pre-processing</title><p>Three sets of ChIP-chip data were used in this study.

Briefly, yeast chromatin was sheared by sonication into fragments with an average size of 500bp. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using antibody against histone H3 (a kind gift from Dr. Alain Verreault <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Gunjan1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>), and then DNA crosslinked with nucleosomes was extracted and purified. Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified and hybridized to Affymetrix Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tiling 1.0R Array to map the nucleosome occupancy along chromosomes in a 4-bp high-resolution manner. Raw intensities were computed by the Two-Sample Analysis method using Affymetrix Tiling Analysis Software v1.1. The tiling array features 2,635,714 oligo probes (25-mer) with 4 bp gaps (i.e. 21 bp overlaps) between the majority (91.5&#x00025;) of adjacent probes. Only less than 1&#x00025; of neighbor probes are separated by gaps longer than 20 bp. The entire yeast genome except centromeres is well represented on the arrays.</p><p>We further generated a new histone H3 ChIP-chip data set (two biological repeats) with a commercial H3 antibody (Abcam ab1791) using Affymetrix tiling arrays.

Compared to standard HMM, SSMM has two major generalizations. First, SSMM uses explicit state length density instead of the implicated exponential density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Rabiner1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. For a standard HMM with transition probability <italic>a<sub>ii</sub></italic> from state <italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic> to itself, the probability that <italic>d</italic> consecutive observations are emitted from state <italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic> is (<italic>a<sub>ii</sub></italic>)<italic><sup>d</sup></italic><sup>-1</sup>(1-<italic>a<sub>ii</sub></italic>). This probability decreases exponentially as <italic>d</italic> increases, which makes long segments impossible. For example, if <italic>a<sub>ii</sub></italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.9 and there is one probe per 4bp, the probability that an NFR is longer than 500bp (typical length of NFR, see result section) is smaller than 2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>. Thus adaptation of explicit state length density is especially important for high density tilling array data. The drawback of explicit state length density is that there are more parameters to estimate, which may lead to over-fitting when sample size is small. However, for tilling array with millions of probes, over-fitting is unlikely to be a problem. Second, SSMM employs a segmental model to calculate the emission probability so that dependency is allowed for all observations within one segment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Ostendorf1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. This is desirable in analyzing tilling array data because this dependency assumption is more realistic. Furthermore, the segmental model can provide quantitative outputs characterizing the shapes of signal patterns. Both HMM and SSMM have been applied in speech recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Rabiner1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Ostendorf1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. HMM has been introduced to computational biology for sequence alignment and gene detection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Krogh1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Eddy1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as identifying TFBSs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Ji1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Li1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and NFRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Yuan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, despite its flexibility in handling high density data, SSMM has not been widely used for genomic studies. One possible reason is its heavy computational burden. The algorithm we introduced in this study incorporates several modifications of regular SSMM, which greatly improve the computational efficiency. We also designed the different hidden states and likelihood evaluation scheme to fit the purpose of NFR identification.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Design of SSMM</title><p>Our SSMM is designed to capture two types of NFR patterns: triangle and trapezoid patterns. We organized the data into three hierarchical levels: probe, bin, and segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004721-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We organized data into &#x0201c;bins&#x0201d; before &#x0201c;segments&#x0201d; for the following two reasons. First, it greatly reduces the computation burden by enforcing all the probes in one bin having only one underlying state. Second, discrete time SSMM assumes equally spaced observations. However, in our data, the gaps between adjacent probes are not constant. Grouping probes into bins ensures the distances between most adjacent bins are constant. Other possible solutions include modeling the transition probability between adjacent probes as a function of their distance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Newton1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, or implementing continuous time SSMM. However, these methods would significantly increase the algorithm complexity and computation time.</p><p>The bin size was empirically determined for the following considerations. On one hand, each bin should be long enough to include enough probes for linear model fitting. Long bins also help filter out noise and reduce computation burden. On the other hand, the signals will be over-smoothed if bins are too long. We use a bin of 50bp which on average covers 10&#x02013;12 probes. This allows enough data points for model fitting while also avoids over-smoothing, given the lengths of NFRs typically vary from several hundred to a few thousand base pairs (see Result).</p><p>We compute the emission probability segment by segment. For one segment, we simply fit a linear model using nucleosome occupancy (log ratio) as the response and probe location as the covariate and then we calculated the emission probability based on the residuals. In order to obtain continuous prediction of nucleosome occupancy, we require the fitted line to start from the end point of previous segment. More details regarding the emission probability calculation are included in section 2.2 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>.</p><p>Several parameters of SSMM need to be estimated: the transition probabilities from state 3 to state 2/4 (other transition probabilities are fixed as 0 or 1) and the probability distributions of state durations. These parameters are estimated by an iterative procedure as following. After generating the initial parameter values by uniform distributions, we first identify the most likely path (&#x0201c;best path&#x0201d;) by Viterbi algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Rabiner1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. We then estimate the parameters based on the most likely path, and iterate until the parameter estimations converge. The Viterbi algorithm for SSMM is a dynamic programming algorithm, which is similar to the one for HMM. The difference is that in order to determine the best path ended at time <italic>k</italic>, state <italic>i</italic>, in addition to choose the previous state <italic>j</italic>, we also need to choose the duration of state <italic>i</italic>. The details of Viterbi algorithms are discussed in section 2.3 of in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>. Given the &#x0201c;best path&#x0201d;, the parameters are estimated in the following way. We estimate the transition probabilities by the corresponding proportions of transitions. The duration probabilities are estimated by the proportions of observed durations. For example, in order to estimate <italic>P</italic>(duration of state <italic>i</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<italic>k</italic>), we first take all the durations of state <italic>i</italic>, and then calculate the proportion of the durations of length <italic>k</italic>. For our data, it takes 7 iterations for the SSMM to converge; the convergence criterion is that the maximum change of either transition probabilities or duration probabilities is smaller than 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>. One commonly used method for parameter estimation in HMM/SSMM is Baum-Welch algorithm (an EM algorithm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004721-Rabiner1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. We do not use this EM algorithm for two reasons. First, as mentioned before, we wish to obtain continuous prediction of nucleosome occupancy; however this is not feasible using EM algorithm. Second, even we allow discontinuous prediction, the EM algorithm is computationally demanding, taking more than 30 times of CPU time compared to our iterative Viterbi algorithm (which takes about one day to finish all the computation). Further details about the algorithm and the parameter estimations are provided in section 2.2 and 2.4 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004721.s001">Supplementary Materials S1</xref>.</p><p>To investigate if our algorithm is easily trapped in a local optimum, we have also tested different initial parameter values. For example, we initiated the state transition/duration distributions from different normal distributions. We also initiated the lengths of states 1 and 2 from the empirical distributions of the lengths of chromosome features and intergenic regions respectively. In all cases we obtained almost identical final outputs.
