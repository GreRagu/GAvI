In the case of gene duplication and subsequent loss, gene trees can differ from species trees, thus frequent gene duplication poses a challenge for reconstruction of species relationships. Here I address the case of multi-gene sets of putative orthologs that include some unrecognized paralogs due to ancestral gene duplication, and ask how outgroups should best be chosen to reduce the degree of non-species tree (NST) signal. Consideration of expected internal branch lengths supports several conclusions: (i) when a single outgroup is used, the degree of NST signal arising from gene duplication is either independent of outgroup choice, or is minimized by use of a maximally closely related post-duplication (MCRPD) outgroup; (ii) when two outgroups are used, NST signal is minimized by using one MCRPD outgroup, while the position of the second outgroup is of lesser importance; and (iii) when two outgroups are used, the ability to detect gene trees that are inconsistent with known aspects of the species tree is maximized by use of one MCRPD, and is either independent of the position of the second outgroup, or is maximized for a more distantly related second outgroup. Overall, these results generalize the utility of closely-related outgroups for phylogenetic analysis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate phylogenetic inference is thwarted by the presence of conflicting signals in the data (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004568-Pagel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004568-Penny1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>), a problem that has received a large amount of theoretical and experimental attention over the past few years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004568-Leigh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004568-Huson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>).

Such cases are particularly troublesome since they are expected to pass the most common bioinformatics test for one-to-one orthologs: genes from different species that are each other's best reciprocal BLAST hit. While under such circumstances every attempt to identify and eliminate such paralogs from analyses should be made, it remains likely that some paralogs will persist in many-locus sets of putative orthologs. Given the importance of gene duplication in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes in general and of several lineages of great interest in particular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004568-Wolfe1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004568-Lynch1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, understanding such challenges is useful for correct reconstruction of evolutionary history.</p><p>Recently, Rogozin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004568-Rogozin1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> suggested that in the case of whole-genome duplication, use of a closely related outgroup &#x02013; specifically one that diverged from the species of introns following the duplication &#x02013; might lead to incorrect species tree reconstruction. Thus, in stark contrast to the general case in the absence of gene duplication, use of a more distant outgroup might be more likely to yield an accurate tree. A great deal of theoretical and empirical work has vindicated taxonomic sampling to reduce branch lengths, including use of closely related outgroups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004568-Hendy1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004568-Philippe1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>; however the case of multi-locus analyses in the presence of differential loss of ancestral gene duplicates has not been addressed to my knowledge. Here I address the issue of outgroup choice in the presence of NST signal arising from subsets of unrecognized paralogs genes within many-gene sets of putative orthologs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Analysis and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Phylogenetic reconstruction in the presence of unrecognized paralogs</title><p>I consider the problem of resolving the relationship between three species/groups by studying many-gene sets of putative one-to-one orthologs, in which some genes have been duplicated in the ancestor of the three species/groups of interest. Following such an ancestral duplication, there are three possible outcomes. Some studied species might retain both duplicates, in which case the gene will not be a one-to-one ortholog, and thus should be recognized and discarded. If not, the two most closely related species/groups might retain the same duplicate copy (either by independent loss of the other duplicate, or loss of one duplicate in an ancestor of the two species/groups), in which case the topologies of the gene and species trees will be identical, and thus the gene duplication is not expected to pose problems to reconstruction of the species tree. Finally, all three species/groups might lose one duplicate copy, but the two most closely related groups lose different (reciprocal) copies, in which case the species and gene trees will have different topologies. It is that third case that I address here.</p><p>The problem is treated under the following conditions and assumptions. First, I consider phylogenetic analysis of concatenated alignments across putative orthologs. Notably, the present arguments do not apply for methods such as matrix representation parsimony, in which trees are reconstructed from individual gene alignments. In such cases the length of the branch supporting the incorrect (non-species) grouping is not of consequence, but only the topology itself. Second, I assume that in general shorter NST internal branches are preferable to long ones, since such branches are expected to generally experience fewer changes and thus contribute less NST signal.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Gene and species trees under gene duplication and loss</title><p>Gene duplication and differential subsequent gene loss can lead to gene trees that do not reflect the species tree. The greater the strength of this alternative (NST) signal, the greater the chance of recovering the wrong tree in multi-locus analyses. The general case is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g001">Figure 1a</xref>. Species C represents an outgroup to species A and B.

This is less than or equal to <italic>d</italic> (since <italic>e</italic>&#x02264;<italic>d</italic>), thus (i) mixed pre/post duplication outgroups are expected to lead to less NST signal than are two pre-duplication outgroups, and (ii) a more closely related post-duplication outgroup is expected to lead to less NST signal than for a more distant one (i.e., small <italic>e</italic> value).</p><p>The case is somewhat more complicated for two post-duplication outgroups. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g003">Figure 3a</xref> illustrates the general case, with outgroups X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> that diverged at times <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>e</italic><sub>2</sub> before the C/AB divergence, respectively (with <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub>&#x0003c;<italic>e</italic><sub>2</sub>&#x0003c;<italic>d</italic>). Now there are four possibilities based on which duplicate copies are retained by X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> relative to C. If X<sub>1</sub> and C retain the same copy (with probability 0.5(1&#x0002b;<italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic>)), the internal NST branch is <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub> (regardless of which duplicate is retained in X<sub>2</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g003">Figure 3b,c</xref>). If X<sub>1</sub> and C retain different copies (with probability 0.5(1&#x02212;<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>)), the issue becomes more complicated still. In this case, the NST internal branch is <italic>e</italic><sub>2</sub> if X<sub>2</sub> and C retain the same copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g003">Figure 3d</xref>), or 2<italic>d</italic>-<italic>e<sub>2</sub></italic> if X<sub>2</sub> and C retain different copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g003">Figure 3e</xref>).</p><p>Which of these two scenarios (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g003">Figure 3d and e</xref>) is more likely? The probability of X<sub>2</sub> retaining the same copy as C is equal to the probability that X<sub>2</sub> and C (but not X<sub>1</sub>) retain the most likely duplicate, 0.5(1&#x0002b;<italic>r</italic>) X 0.5(1&#x0002b;<italic>r</italic>) X 0.5(1&#x02212;<italic>r</italic>), plus the probability that X<sub>2</sub> and C (but not X<sub>1</sub>) retain the less likely duplicate, 0.5(1&#x02212;<italic>r</italic>) X 0.5(1&#x02212;<italic>r</italic>) X 0.5(1&#x0002b;<italic>r</italic>). This sum is simply 0.25(1&#x02212;<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>). The probability of X<sub>2</sub> and X<sub>1</sub> (but not C) retaining the same copy is identical, following the same reasoning. Thus the scenarios in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g003">Figure 3d and 3e</xref> have equally probability. The total expected NST internal branch length is then equal to (i) the probability that X<sub>1</sub> and C retain the same duplicate, 0.5(1&#x0002b;<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>), times <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub>, plus (ii) the probability that X<sub>1</sub> and C retain different duplicates, 0.5(1&#x02212;<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>), times the average of <italic>e</italic><sub>2</sub> and 2<italic>d</italic>-<italic>e</italic><sub>2</sub> (which is <italic>d</italic>). This yields a total average expected NST internal branch length of 0.5((<italic>d&#x0002b;e</italic><sub>1</sub>)&#x02212;<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>(<italic>d&#x02212;e</italic><sub>1</sub>)). This value is equal to the expectation for one post-duplication outgroup diverging at time <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub> and one pre-duplication outgroup (as shown above). Thus, using multiple outgroups, NST signal is minimized by using one closely-related post-duplication outgroup, while the position of the second outgroup (whether pre-duplication, or diverging any time between the duplication and C/AB divergence) does not affect the degree of NST signal in this model.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Maximizing signal for gene tree branches contradicting known species relationships</title><p>In the case of multiple outgroups, a second consideration comes into play. If the additional species (Y, X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>) are confidently known to be true outgroups to an A&#x0002b;B&#x0002b;C clade, then the possibility exists for detecting gene trees that contradict known species relationship, allowing for exclusion of such suspect genes from multi-locus analyses. For instance, for the mixed pre/post duplication outgroup case shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g002">Figure 2c</xref>, the gene tree contains a known non-species tree (KNST) branch (shown in blue) dividing A&#x0002b;C&#x0002b;X from B&#x0002b;Y, which contradicts the known A&#x0002b;B&#x0002b;C group. Since this contradictory signal is useful in detecting suspicious gene trees, optimal outgroup combinations will maximize, not minimize, the length of the KNST.</p><p>Firstly, and most clearly, the presence/absence of a KNST branch differs between different outgroup combinations. For two pre-duplication outgroups, the gene tree still contains an A&#x0002b;B&#x0002b;C group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g002">Figure 2a</xref>), thus there is no KNST branch. By contrast, all cases with at least one post-duplication outgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g002">Figure 2c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g003">Figure 3b&#x02013;e</xref>, excepting post-duplication pairs for which <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<italic>e</italic><sub>2</sub>) contain a KNST branch, thus outgroup combinations that include at least one post-duplication outgroup are preferred.</p><p>For mixed pre/post duplication outgroup pairs the length of the KNST branch is <italic>d-e</italic><sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g002">Figure 2c,d</xref>) regardless of which duplicate is retained in species X. This value is maximized for small <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub>, again supporting usage of a closely related outgroup. For two post-duplication outgroups, the KNST branch length is <italic>e</italic><sub>2</sub>-<italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub> (if both outgroups retain the same duplicate; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g003">Figure 3b,e</xref>) or 2<italic>d-e</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>-e</italic><sub>1</sub> (if different duplicates are retained; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004568-g003">Figure 3c,d</xref>). Thus if both duplicates are equally likely to be retained, the average KNST branch length is <italic>d-e</italic><sub>1</sub>, the same as for mixed pre/post duplication outgroups. If instead duplicates are not equally likely to be retained, the expected average length is smaller than for mixed outgroups: 0.5(1&#x0002b;<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>)(<italic>e</italic><sub>2</sub>-<italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub>)&#x0002b;0.5(1&#x02212;<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>)(2d-<italic>e</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>-e</italic><sub>1</sub>)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<italic>d-e</italic><sub>1</sub> - <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>(<italic>d-e</italic><sub>2</sub>). In this case, KNST branch length is maximized when one outgroup divergence is maximally close (i.e. coincident with the C/AB divergence: <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0) and the other outgroup is coincident with the duplication (<italic>d</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<italic>e</italic><sub>2</sub>). Thus, under unequal probabilities of retention, KNST branch length is maximized for one very close outgroup and one more distant one. As such, depending on the relative probabilities of retention of the two duplicates, the ability to detect aberrant internal branches may provide an exception to the generally better expected performance of maximally closely-related outgroups for phylogenetic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Caveats to the study</title><p>Two limitations of this study are worthy of note. First, only the relationship between three species is considered; however, as more and more recent divergences become resolved, many phylogenetic problems of central interest increasingly reduce to resolution of the relationship between three or a small number of deeply divergent groups. Second, I only consider the case with one or two outgroups; while this is an unrealistically small number of outgroups for single-gene studies, for genome-wide studies such considerations become more important, particularly given the reduction in numbers of detectable orthologs as more taxa are added.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>This discussion of outgroup choice in the presence of differentially retained ancestral gene duplicates yields two arguments supporting the use of closely-related outgroups: (i) for single outgroups, a maximally closely-related post-duplication outgroup either as good as or better than more distant outgroups at reducing non-species tree signal; and (ii) for two outgroups are used, non-species tree signal is minimized when one outgroup is maximally closely-related to the in groups, while the second outgroup position matters less. On the other hand, while the position of the second outgroup position is less important, in the case of different probabilities of retention among duplicates, power to detect gene trees that conflict with known species relationships is maximized when the second outgroup is coincident with or before the duplication event. These findings extend the utility of closely-related outgroups to reducing conflicting signals arising from gene duplication under certain conditions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0004568-Pagel1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
