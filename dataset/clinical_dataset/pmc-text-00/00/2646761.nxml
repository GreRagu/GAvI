Kinetic analysis indicates that the (<italic>R</italic>) enantiomer binds more tightly and is the more potent inhibitor, likely reflecting more favorable interactions with active site residues. Pro-1 is the sole site of covalent modification by the (<italic>R</italic>) and (<italic>S</italic>) enantiomers. Pro-1, Arg-70, Arg-73, and Glu-114, previously identified as catalytic residues in Cg10062, have also been implicated in the inactivation mechanism. Pro-1, Arg-70, and Arg-73 are essential residues for the process as indicated by the observation that the enzymes with the corresponding alanine mutations are not covalently modified by either enantiomer. The E114Q mutant slows covalent modification of Cg10062 but does not prevent it. The results are comparable to those found for the irreversible inactivation of <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD by (<italic>R</italic>)-oxirane-2-carboxylate with two important distinctions: the alkylation of <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD is stereospecific, and Glu-114 does not take part in the <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD inactivation mechanism. Cg10062 exhibits low-level <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD and <italic>trans</italic>-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase (CaaD) activities, with the <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD activity predominating. Hence, the preference of Cg10062 for the <italic>cis</italic> isomer correlates with the observation that the (<italic>R</italic>) enantiomer is the more potent inactivator. Moreover, the factors responsible for the relaxed substrate specificity of Cg10062 may account for the stereoselective inactivation by the enantiomeric epoxides. Delineation of these factors would provide a more complete picture of the substrate specificity determinants for <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD. This study represents an important step toward this goal by setting the stage for a crystallographic analysis of inactivated Cg10062.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi800790y</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2008-00790y</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Cg10062 is a <italic>cis</italic>-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase (<italic>cis</italic>-CaaD)<xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">1</xref> homologue (&#x0223c;34% identical in sequence with <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD) found in <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>).

In the proposed <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD mechanism, Glu-114 and Tyr-103 activate a water molecule for addition to C-3 of <bold>2</bold>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). His-28, Arg-70, and Arg-73 interact with the C-1 carboxylate group to bind and &#x0201c;activate&#x0201d; the substrate for the conjugate addition of water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Pro-1 provides a proton to C-2, which completes the reaction and yields <bold>4</bold>.</p><p>Cg10062 and <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD are found in the same family in the tautomerase superfamily, the members of which are distinguished by a &#x003b2;&#x02212;&#x003b1;&#x02212;&#x003b2; building block and a catalytic Pro-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Despite the presence of the key catalytic groups and the high degree of amino acid sequence similarity with <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD, Cg10062 is a poor <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD. It has a much lower catalytic efficiency, and it does not display absolute specificity for the <italic>cis</italic> isomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). These observations suggest that a fully functional <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD requires features beyond those already identified, and Cg10062 could be representative of the type of intermediate template that gave rise to <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>).</p><p>As part of an effort to determine a structural basis for the differences between the two enzymes, we examined (<italic>R</italic>)- and (<italic>S</italic>)-oxirane-2-carboxylate (<bold>6</bold>) as potential irreversible inhibitors of Cg10062. We have previously reported that <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD is irreversibly inactivated by (<italic>R</italic>)-<bold>6</bold>, due to the covalent modification of Pro-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). The (<italic>S</italic>) enantiomer is not an irreversible inhibitor, and neither enantiomer inactivates CaaD. In accord with the relaxed substrate specificity and preference for <bold>2</bold>, we find that Cg10062 is irreversibly inactivated by both enantiomers, with the (<italic>R</italic>) enantiomer being more potent. Inactivation is due to covalent modification of Pro-1. Pro-1, Arg-70, and Arg-73 are essential for the inactivation of Cg10062, whereas Glu-114 may play a role but not an essential one. These observations parallel those found for <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD, but the lack of stereospecificity and the participation of Glu-114 distinguish the inactivation mechanism for Cg10062 from that of <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD. Hence, the inactivation mechanisms could be similar but may result from different orientations in the active site. These results provide the necessary foundation for a crystallographic analysis of Cg10062 inactivated by (<italic>R</italic>)- and (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>6</bold> so that these orientations can be determined.<graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bi-2008-00790y_0007" position="float"/></p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Materials</title><p>All reagents, buffers, and solvents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co.

Tautomerase superfamily members are characterized by their signature &#x003b2;&#x02212;&#x003b1;&#x02212;&#x003b2; building block and catalytic Pro-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>).

Both have a glutamate residue (Glu-114 and &#x003b1;Glu-52, respectively)<xref rid="fn4" ref-type="fn">4</xref> that activates water for attack at C-3 of the substrate (<bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>, respectively), a pair of arginines (Arg-70 and Arg-73 and &#x003b1;Arg-8 and &#x003b1;Arg11, respectively) that interacts with the C-1 carboxylate group to bind and polarize the substrate, and an amino-terminal proline (Pro-1 and &#x003b2;Pro-1, respectively) that adds a proton to the C-2 position to complete the conjugate addition of water. Two additional groups, His-28 and Tyr-103, are found in <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD. His-28 assists in substrate binding, and Tyr-103 assists in water activation. Cg10062 is a <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD family member that functions as a hydratase but a poor <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD. Despite the presence of the six residues that make up the core catalytic machinery, Cg10062 has a much lower catalytic efficiency than <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD and lacks absolute isomer specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). A determination of the basis for the poor <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD activity of Cg10062 could provide insights into the elements required for a fully functional and highly specific <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD and suggest how <italic>cis-</italic>CaaD evolved.<fn id="fn4"><label>4</label><p>In contrast to <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD and Cg10062, which are trimers, CaaD is a heterohexamer consisting of three &#x003b1;-subunits and three &#x003b2;-subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>).

Mass spectral and crystallographic analysis established that inactivation resulted from covalent modification of the Pro-1 nitrogen by (<italic>R</italic>)-2-hydroxypropanoate at the C-3 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Pro-1, Arg-70, and Arg-73 were identified as essential active site residues for the inactivation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). The crystallographic analysis of the inactivated <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD implicated His-28 in the mechanism and suggested roles for Arg-70 and Arg-73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). On the basis of these observations, it was proposed that Arg-73 and His-28 interact with the carboxylate group and position (<italic>R</italic>)-<bold>6</bold> for covalent modification of Pro-1 (Scheme <xref rid="sch2" ref-type="scheme">2</xref>A). The side chain of Arg-70 or an Arg-70-bound water molecule functions as the proton donor for the epoxide ring opening reaction. This proposed orientation places the (<italic>R</italic>) enantiomer in position for the alkylation reaction. If the (<italic>S</italic>) enantiomer binds similarly, the epoxide ring is flipped so that the Pro-1 nitrogen cannot be alkylated (Scheme <xref rid="sch2" ref-type="scheme">2</xref>B).</p><fig id="sch2" position="float"><label>Scheme 2</label><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bi-2008-00790y_0005" id="gs2" position="float"/></fig><p>The presence of His-28 in <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD may be a determinant of the enzyme&#x02019;s vulnerability to alkylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). CaaD, which is not inactivated by either enantiomer, lacks this residue or an equivalent. As in the proposed binding mode for <bold>3</bold>, the carboxylate group of <bold>6</bold> may interact with the two arginines (&#x003b1;Arg-8 and &#x003b1;Arg-11) in the active site of CaaD, thereby preventing one of the arginines from serving as a necessary proton source to facilitate ring opening. We have also confirmed that MSAD is not inactivated by either enantiomer of <bold>6</bold>. Like CaaD, MSAD has two arginines residues (Arg-73 and Arg-75) but lacks His-28 or an equivalent. The two arginine residues of MSAD are proposed to interact with the substrate and may likewise interact with the carboxylate group of <bold>6</bold> and prevent one from functioning as a proton source. Evidently, there is not an alternate nearby proton source.</p><p>Oxirane-containing compounds have been used extensively as affinity labels of enzymes, and the subsequent characterization of the inactivated enzyme has provided much mechanistic insight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Ring opening, with the concomitant alkylation and inactivation, generally involves acid&#x02212;base catalysis and proceeds by one of two mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). In one mechanism, the acid catalyst protonates the oxygen of the oxirane ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Ring opening produces a carbocation, which captures a nearby base catalyst at the more highly substituted carbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). In a second mechanism, the base catalyst attacks the less sterically hindered carbon of the oxirane in conjugation with polarization of the carbon&#x02212;oxygen ring by the acid catalyst. The regiochemistry of the ring-opened product generated in the <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD reaction with (<italic>R</italic>)-<bold>6</bold> would suggest that the second mechanism is operative. However, it is unknown whether active site constraints played a role in the observed outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>).</p><p>The two key findings in this study are that both (<italic>R</italic>)- and (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>6</bold> inactivate Cg10062 and that Glu-114 is an additional participant in the inactivation mechanism. Otherwise, the inactivation process parallels that observed for <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD, and for the (<italic>R</italic>) enantiomer, a similar mechanism can be envisioned. Accordingly, the carboxylate group would interact with His-28 and Arg-73, and the side chain of Arg-70 or an Arg-70-bound water molecule would interact with the oxirane oxygen to facilitate ring opening. Pro-1 is positioned to attack at C-3.<xref rid="fn5" ref-type="fn">5</xref> The lower potency [compared to the inactivation of <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD by (<italic>R</italic>)-<bold>6</bold>] suggests weaker binding and less favorable interactions with the key active site groups and may reflect some &#x0201c;wobble&#x0201d; in the active site with regard to inhibitor positioning and binding. Glu-114 might further position the epoxide for alkylation or maintain the position of one of the essential residues such that replacement with a glutamine slows the inactivation process.<fn id="fn5"><label>5</label><p>In the proposed mechanism for Cg10062, Pro-1 functions as a general acid catalyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), raising the question of how the charged prolyl nitrogen is alkylated. The sequence similarity between the <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD and Cg10062 active sites suggests that the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values for the prolyl nitrogens will be comparable (&#x0223c;9.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). At the pH of the inactivation experiments (9.0), &#x0223c;33% of the enzyme is in a protonation state where the prolyl nitrogen can function as a nucleophile. Alkylation of the nitrogen perturbs the equilibrium and places an additional amount of enzyme into the nucleophilic and reactive form. In this manner, the enzyme can become entirely alkylated.</p></fn></p><p>There are at least two possible mechanistic explanations for the inactivation of Cg10062 by the (<italic>S</italic>) enantiomer. If it is assumed that the carboxylate group of (<italic>S</italic>)-<bold>6</bold> interacts with His-28 and Arg-73, one potentially interesting scenario involves a change in the regiochemistry of ring opening such that C-2 is the site of attachment. This scenario could involve another unknown residue functioning as the proton source for the oxirane oxygen. In a second scenario, the epoxide could bind in the active site of Cg10062 in a different orientation where the carboxylate group interacts with Arg-70 and Arg-73. Ring opening could occur at C-2 or C-3, and His-28 could function as a proton source. In both scenarios, the side chain of Glu-114 could favor a productive binding mode (i.e., one that results in alkylation) over a nonproductive one.</p><p>There are likely to be subtle differences between the active sites of <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD and Cg10062, and as a consequence, slight differences are observed between the inactivation mechanisms. The two enzymes are 34% identical in sequence (and 53% similar). The residues involved in binding and catalysis (Pro-1, His-28, Arg-70, Arg-73, Tyr-103, and Glu-114) as well as the other residues defining the <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD active site cavity (Thr-32, Thr-34, His-69, and Met-112) are mostly found in Cg10062. The two major exceptions are His-69 and the residues of a loop that connects the &#x003b1;-helix to the second &#x003b2;-strand in the &#x003b2;&#x02212;&#x003b1;&#x02212;&#x003b2; building block. In <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD, His-28 and His-69 interact with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-3. In Cg10062, His-69 is replaced with an isoleucine, which could affect this interaction and perhaps alter the position of His-28 and/or otherwise modulate the active site properties. These changes could contribute to the wobble in the positioning and binding of the inhibitor.</p><p>In addition, the loop residues in Cg10062 are significantly different from those found in <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD. In <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD, Leu-31 and Ala-39 anchor the loop, which consists of Thr-32, Gly-33, Thr-34, Gln-35, His-36, Phe-37, and Leu-38. In Cg10062, Leu-31 and Val-39 anchor the loop, which consists of Ala-32, His-33, Ala-34, Pro-35, Lys-36, Tyr-37, and Leu-38. Examination of the crystal structure of <italic>cis</italic>-CaaD inactivated by (<italic>R</italic>)-<bold>6</bold> shows interactions between the amide hydrogens of Phe-37 and Leu-38 and a carboxylate oxygen of the ring-opened product (2- or 3-hydroxypropanoate). These interactions may be precluded in Cg10062 due to the different N-terminal loop residues (i.e., residues 32&#x02212;35). The absence of these interactions coupled with the potentially different properties of the loop may result in a less discriminating active site and allow binding of both enantiomers. Crystal structures of Cg10062 inactivated by the enantiomers of <bold>6</bold> will shed light on the basis for the differences in the inactivation mechanisms and are currently being pursued.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The mass spectrometry described in this paper was carried out in the Analytical Instrumentation Facility Core housed in the College of Pharmacy at The University of Texas and supported by Center Grant ES 07784.
