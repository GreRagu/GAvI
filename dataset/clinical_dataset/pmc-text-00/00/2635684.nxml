The screws and nails were installed according to ASTM-D 1761 standards. Nail dimensions were 2.5mm diameter and 50 mm length, conventional screws were 4&#x000d7;50mm, serrated screws were 4&#x000d7;45mm and smart screws were 4&#x000d7;50mm. Results show that the maximum screw withdrawal resistance value was found in Stone pine for the serrated screw. There were no significant differences between Stone pine and oak regarding screw withdrawal resistance values. Conventional screw yielded the maximum screw withdrawal resistance value in oak, followed by Stone pine, black pine and fir. Oak wood showed the maximum screw withdrawal resistance value for the smart screw, followed by Stone pine, black pine, and fir. Oak wood showed higher nail withdrawal resistances than softwood species. It was also determined that oak shows the maximum nail withdrawal resistance in all types.

Introduction</title><p>The rigidity of furniture and other wooden furniture accessories depends on the type and thickness of the wood, as well as how the wooden pieces were put together. Screws and nails are widely used as joint components of furniture construction and since each wood species has its own properties, they also have different screw and nail withdrawal resistances. Therefore, it is important for both producers and consumers to be aware of the best screw and nail withdrawal resistance for the various wood species.</p><p>Ferah performed nail withdrawal resistance experiments at tangential, radial and cross-section angle penetration into wood of two different humidity levels (12% and 30%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-4-626">1</xref>]. Tangential surface screw withdrawal resistance experiments were performed according to TS 6094 and ASTM-D1761 standards on seven wood species that were obtained in the &#x0201c;Elmali Ciglikara Sedir Research Forest&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Abant-Bolu region&#x0201d;. They determined that Sessile oak had the maximum screw withdrawal resistance value, followed by <italic>Fagus orientalis</italic>, red pine, black pine, Lebanese cedar and respectively. Uludag Fir was found to have the minimum screw withdrawal resistance value, while the maximum value was obtained from Sessile oak, followed by <italic>Fagus orientalis</italic>, red pine, black pine, Lebanese cedar and respectively, and the lowest value was obtained from Uludag fir.</p><p>Doganay determined parallel and perpendicular screw withdrawal resistance for three types of screws (17&#x000d7;17, 18&#x000d7;25 and 20&#x000d7;30 types) commonly used in Werzalit wood furniture production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijms-9-4-626">2</xref>]. The results of the experiments show that the most effective material in screw withdrawal resistance from both directions is the Fagus orientalis wood, followed by Werzalit, MDF and particleboard, respectively.</p><p>Raczkowscha determined that the nail withdrawal resistance of Scotch pine juvenile wood is lower than that of heartwood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijms-9-4-626">3</xref>]. This was found in 30% perpendicular to grain and 10% parallel to grain. He also stated that there is a linear relationship between nail withdrawal resistance and the density of wood; nail withdrawal resistance perpendicular to grain in juvenile wood is lower than in older wood with the same density.</p><p>Fujita determined that investigations were carried out on a withdrawal-resistance, in the case when nails were driven on a specimen in air drying condition through the five kinds of Sugi-woods (<italic>Cryptomeria japonica</italic>) growing at Takakuma University Forest, Kagoshima Prefecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-9-4-626">4</xref>]. The five kinds of Sugi-wood are Yakusugi-, Measasugi-, Yoshinosugi-, Kumotoushisugi- and Obiarakawasugi-wood aged 52,27,28 and 28, respectively. In this paper, 1. Concerning the withdrawal-resistance the highest value was noted in Yakusugi-wood, and the lowest one in Obiarakawasugi-wood. 2. A average withdrawal-resistance was ascertained to be dependent on the specific gravity of Sugi-wood growing at Takakuma University Forest. 3. Withdrawal-resistance to respective nail types, which were assorted into chequered-head countersunk-smooth type and -screw type, was decreasing in accordance with the width of average annual ring. But a withdrawal-resistance to wood screw was independent of the width of annual ring.</p><p>Broker and Krause performed static and dynamic screw withdrawal experiments on three layered particleboard, European Spruce grown in Norway, and European Birch wood with 9 types of screws. They concluded that the screw withdrawal resistance value is linearly proportional with screw length and screw diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-9-4-626">5</xref>].</p><p>Bues and his colleagues pounded 2&#x000d7;40 mm sized nails into 250 20&#x000d7;20&#x000d7;110 dimensional wood samples which were obtained from scattered cuttings of pine wood and measured their withdrawal resistances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-9-4-626">6</xref>]. They used screws of 20 mm groove length, 1.8 mm cog step, and 60&#x000b0; cog angle on nail holes of 2 mm diameter. After suitable conditioning, they measured screw and nail withdrawal resistances on radial and tangential directions as 50 N/s, and determined the relationship between the density and screw and nail withdrawal resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-9-4-626">6</xref>]. As a result, they determined average nail withdrawal resistance as 1.27 KN in radial direction, 1.06 KN in tangential direction with 0.50 g/cm<sup>3</sup> average density and with 12% humidity. They also determined average screw withdrawal resistance as 1.48 KN in radial direction and 1.42 KN in tangential direction at the same conditions. The meaningful differences in the screw and nail withdrawal resistance values in the tangential and radial directions were established by 20% of nails and 4% of screws. They determined that screw withdrawal resistance of the screws was 16% higher in radial direction and 34% higher in tangential direction than nails.</p><p>Reardon and Boughton examined 6 types of grooved nails on 7 species of pine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-9-4-626">7</xref>]. They determined that nail withdrawal resistances of grooved nails are 2&#x02013;3 times higher than that of smooth trunk nails. However, there is no relationship between the density of wood types and withdrawal resistance values.</p><p>Kim concluded the effect of nail direction and time elapse after nailing into the static withdrawal resistance by nailing 4.9&#x02013;5.1 mm length and 0.25&#x02013;0.26 mm diameter nails into pine and larix wood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijms-9-4-626">8</xref>]. As a result, Kim determined that there is a linear relationship between static withdrawal resistance and humidity amount. Kim presented the relationship in both species of wood in tangential, radial and longitudinal directions.</p><p>Kanamori and his coworkers measured withdrawal resistance of nails that were nailed into dried wood samples of <italic>Picea jezoensis</italic>, <italic>Larix leptolepis</italic> and <italic>Quercus crispula</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-9-4-626">9</xref>]. Five humidity levels were analyzed. It was determined that nail withdrawal resistance of circular ribbed nails (max. 2.9 mm diameter) decreases during the process. The majority of this decrease occurs in the first phase. For the helical ribbed nails (max 3.2 mm diameter), nail withdrawal resistance does not change or increase unessential. In addition, nail withdrawal resistance of <italic>Quercus crispula</italic> is twice as that of the two other wood types. Kanamori and his coworkers compared nail withdrawal resistance of common wire nails, helitical ribbed nails and galvanized circular ribbed nails that were nailed tangentially, radially and longitudally nailed into three types of wood (<italic>Picea jezoensis</italic>, <italic>Larix leptolepis</italic> and <italic>Quercus crispula</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-4-626">10</xref>]. They performed experiments in three different conditions; nailed into undried wood over a 6 month drying period, nailed into dried wood, over a 7 month humidity taken and humidity release period, nailed into dried wood over 15 months at equilibrium humidity.</p><p>Kjucukov and Encev measured screw withdrawal resistance of screws with different lengths (13&#x02013;60 mm) and different diameters (1.5&#x02013;8 mm) that were screwed into <italic>Abies alba</italic> wood in three directions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-9-4-626">11</xref>]. As a result, they determined that there is no relationship between screw withdrawal resistance and screw length, and there is a linear relationship between screw withdrawal resistance and screw diameter.</p><p>Kjucukov and Encev performed with 1.5&#x02013;6.0 mm diameters screws on <italic>Fagus orientalis</italic> and determined that there is a linear relationship between screw withdrawal resistance and screw diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-4-626">12</xref>]. This result confirms the experiment results on fir wood.</p><p>Lexa concluded nail withdrawal resistances of steal nails covered with an epoxy resin that was nailed into dried and green spruce, fir, and <italic>Fagus orientalis</italic> wood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-4-626">13</xref>]. He determined that the nail withdrawal resistances of covered nails are smaller, the nail withdrawal resistances of covered nails are higher on the dried wood, and the nail withdrawal resistances of covered nails are slowly diminished.</p><p>Bacher nailed nails on wood with 60% humidity and measured the nail withdrawal resistance during the drying period from 60% humidity to 0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-4-626">14</xref>]. As a result, he determined that nail withdrawal resistance diminishes when the wood humidity amount decreased to the leaf saturation point.</p><p>Hellawel concluded nail withdrawal resistance in the wood samples at fresh, air dried, partially dried and moistened conditions just after nailing, and the effect of drying and time on this property [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-9-4-626">15</xref>]. He concluded that Rimu wood generally has higher nail withdrawal resistance than Radiata pine wood.</p><p>Noguchi and Sugihara compared nail withdrawal resistance of chrome nickel and iron nails that were nailed longitudinally, radially, tangentially at static and dynamic conditions on 6&#x000d7;6&#x000d7;30 cm experiment samples of <italic>Cryptomeria japonica</italic>, <italic>Fagus crenata</italic> and <italic>Chamaecyparis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-9-4-626">16</xref>]. They determined that nail withdrawal resistance at static nailing is higher than dynamic nailing. They concluded that nail withdrawal resistance decreases with time in the density of wood in both nailing types. It was also found that the nail withdrawal resistance is maximized for tangentially nailing nails. They formulated equations on nail withdrawal resistance and wood density, nail diameter and time after nailing.</p><p>Mack compared static nail withdrawal resistance of flat and ribbed nails on wet and air dried Radiata pine and Eucalyptus wood after different periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-9-4-626">17</xref>]. He concluded that ribbed nails show high nail withdrawal resistance values on soft and hard wood during and after the nailing period.</p><p>Scholten found that the highest nail withdrawal resistance values were obtained from sharp tip nails on wood with low density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-4-626">18</xref>]. Wood with high density did not divide after nailing. He proposed common nails for wood with high division resistances.</p><p>Stern and Price measured nail withdrawal resistance of different shaped nails on the structural quality of southern yellow pine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijms-9-4-626">19</xref>]. As a result, they concluded that circular ribbed and screw dented nails show higher resistances than common wire nails. There was also a linear relationship between nail withdrawal resistance and nail diameter in big diameter nails and this relationship was higher than predicted.</p><p>Ayyildiz and Malkocoglu, carried on the screw withdrawal resistance of stem wood material of <italic>Fagus orientalis</italic> Lipsky., <italic>Alnus glitunosa</italic> subsp. <italic>barbata</italic> (C.A.Mey) Yalt., <italic>Castenea sativa</italic> Mill., <italic>Picea orientalis</italic> (L.) Link., and <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-9-4-626">20</xref>]. The wood samples of these tree species were collected from forest districts in G&#x000fc;m&#x000fc;shane, Trabzon and Artvin located in Eastern Black Sea region of Turkey. Tests were carried out according to the TS 6094 and ASTM-D 143 and ASTM-D 1761 on 60 samples of each one of the tree species. Half of the samples had 12% and the other half had 30% moisture contents. The dimensions of wood materials on which the tests were carried out were 50&#x000d7;50&#x000d7;150 mm. Screws used for withdrawal tests were 4.5 mm in diameter and 40 mm in length. Two screws were inserted into lead holes at right angles on the tangential surface, 26 mm penetration. In this study, the results presented that the highest screw withdrawal resistance was found for oriental beech among the five tree species. The order of screw withdrawal resistance from the higher to the lower was found as follows; alder, chestnut, pine, spruce. In regards to moisture effects, the screw withdrawal resistances were found to be higher at the 12% moisture content.</p><p>In this study, screw and nail withdrawal resistance of fir (<italic>Abies nordmanniana</italic>), oak (<italic>Quercus robur</italic> L.) black pine (<italic>Pinus nigra</italic> Arnold) and Stone pine (<italic>Pinus pinea</italic> L.) wood were determined and compared. This study includes the comparison of nail and screw withdrawal resistances for the same species and between other species.

Conclusions</title><p>According to these results, the serrated screw has higher screw withdrawal resistance with respect to other screw types. In addition, it`s easy application yields an additional advantage. However, the usage of the serrated screw is not common today. In order to increase the performance, the usage of serrated screw should be increased.</p><p>It was determined that smart screws used in the connection of wooden materials to metals, gave the minimum screw withdrawal resistance. Because of the fact that these types of screws are produced for the metal connections, their cog structure is not suitable for wooden materials. Because of their easy application in the connection of metal and wooden materials, they are used broadly.</p><p>According to these results, it is clear that in the connection with nail and screw,
