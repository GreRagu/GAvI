One of the main reasons for fatal aggravation of the disease is bacterial superinfection of necrotic pancreatic tissue and the subsequent development of septic complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The risk of pancreatic superinfection is dependent on the amount of necrosis. The risk is about 20% if necrosis is less than 50% and increases up to 70% when pancreatic necrosis exceeds 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In order to evaluate the benefit of prophylactic antibiotic application, a number of randomised controlled clinical trials have been published over the past 15 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Since the results were conflicting and most studies were of low methodological quality and/or statistically underpowered, meta-analyses have been performed to assess this important issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, the results of several recent meta-analyses were also controversial. Some reported a benefit of prophylactic antibiotic treatment to avoid pancreatic superinfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], some did not find significant differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Others found that antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with decreased mortality but not with a decrease of extrapancreatic infections, infected pancreatic necrosis or operative treatment rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Due to these previously conflicting results, the Cochrane review in 2006 concluded that more trials were needed to confirm the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Consequently, until today there remain diverse treatment recommendations. Although most national and international guidelines for the management of acute pancreatitis recommend the use of early prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], others do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>There are a number of reasons why clinical trials and meta-analyses concerning the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis in acute pancreatitis remain controversial. First, the severity of acute pancreatitis of patients included in studies showed great variations. For example, due to a lack of patient recruitment, several clinical trials included patients with an overall rate of pancreatic infected necrosis of 20% or less [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which is lower than the expected 40% to 70% in the natural course of this disease as described by Beger and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, there was a great heterogeneity in management of acute pancreatitis. In some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] patients were included up to 120 hours after onset of symptoms, at points in time when pancreatic necrosis was completely developed and in some cases already superinfected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The most significant change in the clinical course of acute pancreatitis over the past decades has been the decrease in mortality from 40% to about 20%, mainly due to improvement of intensive care management. This decrease of mortality not only makes it difficult to compare recent studies to trials performed several years ago, it also has to be taken into account for calculations of trial sample size when considering mortality as an end-point. Also, many patients in recent studies showed relatively mild necrotising pancreatitis with less than 30% necrosis. Therefore, power calculations should be based on a pancreatic superinfection rate of about 20% compared with historical data, in which the rate of pancreatic necrosis was 50%. Theoretically, in order to prove that a reduction in infected necrosis decreases mortality from 20% to 10%, more than 3000 patients would have to be included in a clinical study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In contrast to this, almost all trials performed in the past recruited only a small number of patients and even in the most recent published study, which was performed in 32 centres, the calculated number of patients (n = 240) was not reached and the study terminated early [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, all studies performed so far were statistically underpowered and it becomes clear that given the heterogeneity in patient management, it is difficult, or near impossible, to achieve the required number of patients in the future.</p><p>Due to variations in methodological quality, treatment regimens and the difficulty of including enough patients for a powerful study, the question of efficiency of antibiotic prophylaxis in acute necrotising pancreatitis can not be answered by clinical studies. In contrast to most medical treatments, where results from animal experiments are validated by clinical studies, in this case it was necessary to revert to animal experiments to create standardised settings in order to compare different antibiotic regimens. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of antibiotic treatment in acute necrotising pancreatitis in a standardised animal model, and to investigate if there is a difference between the efficiency of early prophylactic antibiotic treatment and on-demand therapy after occurrence of proven infected necrosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Experimental animals</title><p>Inbred male Wistar rats weighing 300 to 340 g (n = 68) were used for the experiments.

The left internal jugular vein was cannulated using a soft polyethylene catheter (0.5 mm ID, 0.8 mm OD, Braun Melsungen, Germany) for infusion regimens. The catheter was tunnelled subcutaneously to the suprascapular area and brought out through a steel tether that allowed free movement of the animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of acute necrotising pancreatitis</title><p>A detailed description of the induction technique has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In brief, the common bile duct was punctured and glycodeoxycholic acid (GDOC, Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, USA) in glycyl-glycine-NaOH buffered solution (pH 8.0, room temperature) at a concentration of 10 mmol/L was infused in a time- (10 minute), pressure- (30 mmHg) and volume-controlled fashion (1.2 ml/kg). Subsequently, animals received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5 &#x003bc;g/kg/hour (6 ml/kg/hour) caerulein (Caerulein, Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, USA) over six hours followed by volume substitution with 6 ml/kg/hour sodium chloride (NaCl) solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>In our first set of experiments, all animals were euthanased at 24 hours after induction of acute necrotising pancreatitis. At the end of the 24-hour period, pancreatic injury was evaluated by histological assessment of oedema, inflammation and necrosis. Animals (n = 6) receiving prophylactic antibiotic treatment (40 mg/kg intravenous Meropenem<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, AstraZeneca GmbH, Wedel, Germany) every eight hours as a single dose started six hours after induction of acute pancreatitis) were compared with a control group (n = 6) that did not receive antibiotic treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Septic complications were evaluated by bacteriological assessments of blood, ascites, pancreas and mesenteric lymph nodes of both the colon and small bowel, as well as by 24-hour mortality rates.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Experimental design</bold>. Animals in all treatment groups received induction of acute necrotising pancreatitis at time point 0. In experimental group 1, animals were euthanased at 24 hours. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment (starting six hours after induction of pancreatitis) was evaluated versus no antibiotic treatment. In a second experimental group, animal were euthanased at 72 hours.

Only animals that survived the first 24 hours after induction of acute pancreatic were included in the analysis. The results of our first experimental group demonstrated that superinfection of pancreatic necrosis is present in all animals at 24 hours. In order to imitate the clinical setting of severe necrotising pancreatitis, animals were treated with meropenem either prophylactically before infection of pancreatic necrosis was observed, or therapeutically after superinfection of pancreatic necrosis was present (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the first group of animals (n = 8) was infused with meropenem therapeutically after a therapy-free interval of 24 hours, which corresponds to treatment on-demand in the clinical setting. The second group (n = 8) received meropenem at six hours after induction of acute pancreatitis. At this point, pancreatic necrosis had already been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], but necrotic tissue was not yet superinfected because bacterial translocation occurs about 18 hours after induction of acute pancreatitis in severe experimental pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In the clinical setting this corresponds to a patient who presents to the hospital within the first three days after onset of the disease and receives antibiotics prophylactically. After induction of acute pancreatitis, animals received a continuous standardised intravenous volume substitution with 6 ml/kg/hour NaCl solution. A third group served as controls and received the same fluid regimen using NaCl instead of meropenem.</p><p>To evaluate bacterial and fungal infection in the long-term postoperative course, we investigated animals from the prophylactic antibiotic treatment group after seven days (n = 6). The focus of investigations in this experimental group was to evaluate the rate of fungal infection after prophylactic antibiotic treatment. Six animals underwent sham laparotomy without induction of acute pancreatitis and served as controls. Animals received intraductal saline and intravenous saline only. All parameters as described above were evaluated.</p><p>All animals were fasted for the first 24 hours of the experiment and received 6 ml/kg/hour NaCl as volume therapy. After 24 hours, animals had free access to food and water. Animals that died of technical or anaesthesiological complications were excluded from the study.

Due to major improvements in intensive-care management over the past decade, more patients survive the first phase of severe acute pancreatitis and therefore the prophylaxis and treatment of infected necrosis is of increasing clinical importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In many cases infected pancreatic necrosis results in the development of multiple organ failure or septic complications and is associated with high mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Although various studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] have detected a beneficial role of early prophylactic treatment in acute pancreatitis, two recent double-blind studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] could not demonstrate any beneficial effects of antibiotic prophylaxis with respect to the risk of developing infected pancreatic necrosis and mortality. However, the study by Isenmann and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] included mainly patients with mild to moderate pancreatitis, as seen by the low rate of superinfection and low mortality rate even in the control group. Regardless, the indication for antibiotic prophylaxis in necrotising pancreatitis remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Over the past decade, it has become clear that because of variations in patient recruitment and treatment regimens it is almost impossible to include enough patients for a meaningful clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Consequently, the question whether antibiotic prophylaxis in acute necrotising pancreatitis is effective in clinical practice can not be answered by clinical studies. Thus, the aim of the present study was to use a well standardised animal model to investigate the efficiency of early prophylactic antibiotic treatment compared with on-demand therapy on pancreatic infection rates, septic complications and mortality. Although, no experimental model mirrors the clinical setting completely, duct perfusion models are currently the most popular models of acute pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], because they are characterised by similar pathophysiological steps as the human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>In 1993, Tarpila and colleagues showed that acute pancreatitis in a rat model caused systemic bacterial colonisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. They suspected bacterial translocation was the mechanism of pancreatic infection. In the present study, we found bacterial infection of blood, ascites and mesenteric lymph nodes of the colon and small bowel in almost all animals after induction of severe acute necrotising pancreatitis. The specification showed typical enteric flora in mesenteric lymph nodes of the small bowel and colon, which reflects bacterial translocation from the gut. There was no significant difference between infection of mesenteric lymph nodes of the colon and small bowel. The pathogenesis of pancreatic superinfection is not completely understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, our findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that intra-abdominal spread by lymphatics is the pathway most likely to be involved in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Despite the fact that in the present study a limited number of animals were available in each experimental group, we demonstrated that pancreatic and systemic infection in necrotising pancreatitis is reduced by prophylactic antibiotic treatment with meropenem (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Furthermore, it reduced sepsis-related mortality (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Meropenem was used because it has been shown previously that penetration into necrotic pancreatic tissue occurred in sufficient therapeutic concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, meropenem might be an effective antibiotic for prevention of bacterial superinfection of necrotic pancreatic tissue and its consecutive sepsis. This is consistent with the clinical findings of many studies on acute pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and a recent meta-analysis, which demonstrated reduced mortality and pancreatic infection rate with beta-lactam antibiotics compared with others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Recent clinical experience has provided evidence that conservative management and early prophylactic antibiotic administration in sterile necrotising pancreatitis is the treatment of choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, various clinical centres have diverse strategies for the treatment of acute pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. To date, it remains unclear whether prophylactic antibiotic treatment or on-demand antibiotic therapy is more beneficial. Therefore, we also evaluated the effectiveness of antibiotic on-demand therapy beginning after a latency period of 24 hours after induction of necrotising pancreatitis versus early antibiotic prophylaxis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>Both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment on-demand reduced septic complications and mortality in experimental necrotising pancreatitis. This is supported by the results of several clinical trials performed so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, our experiments showed a greater benefit for prophylactic early antibiotic treatment compared with on-demand therapy concerning superinfection of the pancreas, mortality and sepsis. Already at 24 hours, bacterial infection of lymph nodes of the colon could be significantly (p = 0.015) reduced from 83.3% to 0% by early antibiotic prophylaxis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These findings support the hypothesis that translocation of enteric bacteria occurs during the early stage of acute necrotising pancreatitis. This is in accordance with the results of rat experiments performed by Foitzik and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and Wang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], as well as with clinical findings published by Beger and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and Ammori and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], who found endotoxaemia in 20 of 26 patients with acute pancreatitis. Therefore, as a result of our experiments we would recommend to start antibiotic therapy as early as possible after the diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis has been made. This is of particular relevance because the latest clinical trials were all statistically underpowered and could not show any difference between these two treatment modalities.</p><p>A steady rise in the incidence of pancreatic fungal infections in severe pancreatitis has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and it was hypothesised that the widespread use of antibiotics is the cause for this phenomenon. There is also some evidence that fungal infections may worsen the outcome of acute pancreatitis, but to date this hypothesis has not been proven [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In fact, the incidence of fungal infections varies between different trials within a range of 0% to 37% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In our experiments, we could not detect any fungal infection after induction of necrotising pancreatitis at any time point up to seven days. Even the use of broad-spectrum meropenem with its strong selection pressure on microorganisms did not result in detectable fungal infection. In contrast to our experimental standardised setup, patients in the clinical setting often undergo repeated interventional procedures including central venous lines or urinary catheters, which might trigger the occurrence of fungal infections during the course of necrotising pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, with regard to the present experimental setting, we cannot exclude that fungal infections might occur at a later stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>With regard to the present study and previously published literature, meropenem is an effective antibiotic drug for the treatment of bacterial pancreatic infection in acute necrotising pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the experimental model, both prophylactic and delayed treatment on-demand reduced septic complications and mortality. Although clinical trials have been statistically underpowered and consequently could not demonstrate any difference between antibiotic prophylaxis versus treatment on-demand, we show that in a standardised model prophylactic administration reduced pancreatic superinfection, mortality and sepsis more effectively compared with treatment on-demand. Following our experiments, the administration of antibiotics should be started earlier rather than later in the course of severe pancreatitis associated with pancreatic necrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x02022; The role of early antibiotic prophylaxis in severe acute pancreatitis remains controversial because clinical studies performed to date have been underpowered and results are conflicting.</p><p>&#x02022; Considering the complex clinical presentation, the heterogeneous population of patients and different treatment regimens, it is difficult or near impossible to include enough patients for a meaningful clinical trial.</p><p>&#x02022; In a standardised setting of experimental necrotising pancreatitis, pancreatic superinfection, bacteraemia and mortality rate were reduced significantly by early prophylactic antibiotic treatment but not delayed antibiotic treatment on-demand.</p><p>&#x02022; Prophylactic antibiotic treatment is superior to treatment on-demand.
