The technique is frequently used to validate and improve the precision of measurement of differences in transcript abundance detected by DNA microarray experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In QPCR, product formation is monitored at the end of each thermal cycle by determining the strength of a fluorescent signal that is proportional to the amount of product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; QPCR thus provides more information than can be inferred from signal detected at the end of multiple cycles of reaction, as in conventional PCR analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Because data can be collected from the exponential phase of the reaction a generally reliable quantitation of target DNA concentration can be achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Detection of QPCR product concentration is usually accomplished by one of two general fluorescence-based approaches: the measurement of a target sequence-selective signal arising from a conformational change in a labeled primer, or the measurement of total DNA formed during the reaction. In the former method, target-specific probes containing fluorophores, such as hydrolysis probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], dual hybridization probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], molecular beacons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or scorpions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] are designed. These detection systems provide partial protection against the risk of generation of signals from off-target amplicons but the primers are considerably more expensive to generate than conventional unlabeled primers. In a more widely practiced variant of QPCR, sequence non-selective fluorescent dyes that bind to double-stranded DNA, such as SYBR Green I, are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The quantum yield of SYBR Green I dye intercalated into double-stranded DNA is much greater than the quantum yield of free dye, leading to an increase in fluorescence intensity that, at saturating dye concentration, is proportional to DNA concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This yields a simple inexpensive way to measure product amplicon formation. However, the contribution of fluorescence from DNA arising by amplification of undesired sequences cannot be determined without some additional measure, such as thermal dissociation analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Several online resources have been described that can be used to design primers for PCR and QPCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and are useful for gene expression analysis, when a small number of genes are of interest. We have previously described a resource of designed primers that can be used for real-time PCR with sequence independent detection methods, such as SYBR Green I detection, and that can work under a common PCR thermal profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Amplification of undesired sequences is a common problem in QPCR, and poses greater difficulties when the amplification conditions cannot be tailored to the primer pair of interest, as for example would be the case for massively parallel QPCR. The primer design algorithm used for the selection of primers for this study was based on a previous approach to the prediction of oligonucleotides for the study of protein coding regions by microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], but differed by the addition of filters thought to be important for PCR primer specificity. Primers were designed from cDNA sequence information and the principal filter for cross-reactivity was the rejection of primers containing contiguous residues (15 bases or longer) present in other sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Additionally, the selected primer pairs had no self-complementarity, low 3' end stability and high complexity. Low complexity regions may contribute to primer cross-reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], so they were excluded using the DUST program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The primer <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>s were in the same range, as well as their GC contents. Short amplicons (60&#x02013;350 bp) were favored during primer selection, but in some cases 100&#x02013;800 bp amplicons were also considered when the design criteria could not be met for shorter amplicons.</p><p>The collection of designed primer pairs has been deposited in a public resource called PrimerBank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. PrimerBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/"/> contains primers for most known human and mouse genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The primers designed for the mouse genome cover 27684 genes, but because of some redundancy &#x02013; one primer pair can represent multiple genes, in most cases isoforms &#x02013; only 26855 primer pairs were synthesized to represent once each of these 27684 genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). For another 1165 mouse genes, it was not possible to design primers, mainly due to low sequence quality. The average sequence length for these genes, the majority of which are 'unknown' or RIKEN sequences, is 435 bp while the average mouse gene has 1293 bp. All primers have been designed to have uniform properties and work using the same PCR conditions which simplifies analyzing the expression of many genes in parallel by QPCR.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Statistics of primers contained in the PrimerBank database.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Species</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Genes represented</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Primers</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Human</td><td align="left">33741</td><td align="left">167882</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Mouse</td><td align="left">27684</td><td align="left">138918</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total</td><td align="left">61425</td><td align="left">306800</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>PrimerBank primer design and gene representation.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Mouse primer pair design</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Number of mouse primer pairs or genes</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Primer pairs with no redundancy</td><td align="left">23700</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Primer pairs with 2 target genes</td><td align="left">2534</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Primer pairs with more than 2 target genes</td><td align="left">621</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total number of primer pairs</td><td align="left">26855</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total number of genes represented</td><td align="left">27684</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Total number of genes not represented</td><td align="left">1165</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Primer pairs for the mouse genome have 27684 gene targets.

These primers amplified successfully and specifically the genes for which they had been designed, even though some genes were from closely related gene families. As a second step, we tested by QPCR 26855 PrimerBank mouse primer pairs, representing most known mouse genes, in order to determine if they can successfully amplify the genes for which they had been designed. From the experimental validation procedure, we identified 17483 pairs of primers that amplify unique sequences corresponding to distinct murine transcripts. We also validated on genomic DNA some of the primer pairs that initially failed by QPCR, to provide explanations for these failures. We determined the uniformity of amplification using 96 PrimerBank primer pairs, and the technical reproducibility of the QPCRs, using the same primer pairs. In addition, SYBR Green I sequence specificity was investigated, using a set of sequences differing in length and base composition. Successful primer pair information is now freely available from the PrimerBank database together with the experimental validation data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The mouse serves as an excellent model for studying the function of human genes <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and currently more genomic resources exist for mouse compared to human.

Universal mouse total RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamers and the cDNA was used as a template. 26855 primer pairs, corresponding to 27684 transcripts, were tested by QPCR and the amplification plots and dissociation curves were analyzed. The same PCR conditions were used for all reactions. PCR amplification plots indicate SYBR Green I fluorescence which is proportional to PCR product formation.

From the amplification plots, PCR products appeared typically between 19 and 27 cycles of PCR, with a small variation of 1 or 2 cycles depending on the length of the PCR product and thus the amount of SYBR Green I bound to it.

All successfully sequenced samples (24476) were BLAST analyzed. From the primer validation procedure, primer pairs were grouped into successful or failed, according to the analysis criteria. From 26855 primer pairs tested 17483 (65.1%) primer pairs, corresponding to 18324 transcripts, were found to be successful by QPCR, agarose gel, sequencing and BLAST analysis. 22189 (82.6%) primer pairs were successful based on agarose gel electrophoresis analysis and 19453 (72.4%) primer pairs were successful based on BLAST analysis. Primer pairs which failed based on the experimental validation procedure can be grouped into various types. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> presents a classification of the types of failures. In a few cases (less than 0.8%), primer pairs were found to be successful based on the gel or BLAST analysis criteria, but no amplification could be detected with SYBR Green I. Sequencing can be very sensitive and a low abundance amplicon can thus be sequenced successfully despite low amounts. Also, in many cases where PCR products were short (~60&#x02013;80 bp) it was not possible to obtain sequencing information for these samples.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Classification of failed PrimerBank primer pairs.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Type of failure</td><td align="left">Reasons for failure</td><td align="left">Number of primer pairs</td><td align="left">% from total analyzed</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="4"><bold>QPCR failures:</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">QT</td><td align="left">No amplification detected</td><td align="left">1745</td><td align="left">6.5%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4"><bold>Agarose gel failures:</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">G1</td><td align="left">No band observed on gel</td><td align="left">1619</td><td align="left">6.0%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">G2</td><td align="left">Multiple bands observed on gel</td><td align="left">2177</td><td align="left">8.1%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">G3</td><td align="left">Wrong size band observed on gel</td><td align="left">645</td><td align="left">2.4%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">G4</td><td align="left">Faint band observed on gel</td><td align="left">224</td><td align="left">0.8%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">GT</td><td align="left">Failed based on gel analysis criteria (G1&#x02013;G4)</td><td align="left">4665</td><td align="left">17.4%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4"><bold>Sequencing failures:</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">ST</td><td align="left">Low sequence quality</td><td align="left">2378</td><td align="left">8.9%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4"><bold>BLAST failures:</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left">B1</td><td align="left">Sequences obtained did not match to the expected sequences</td><td align="left">1217</td><td align="left">4.5%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B2</td><td align="left">Low match length between sequences obtained and the expected sequences</td><td align="left">2732</td><td align="left">10.2%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">B3</td><td align="left">Low % identity between sequences, expected sequences were not 1<sup>st </sup>matches</td><td align="left">1074</td><td align="left">4.0%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">BT</td><td align="left">Failed based on BLAST analysis criteria (B1&#x02013;B3)</td><td align="left">5023</td><td align="left">18.7%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>26855 primer pairs, corresponding to 27684 transcripts were tested by QPCR, agarose gel electrophoresis, sequencing and BLAST. 26854 primer pairs, corresponding to 27683 transcripts, were tested by agarose gel electrophoresis, sequencing and BLAST.

This analysis was based on determining whether one PCR product of the correct size could be visualized from agarose gel electrophoresis data. Most primer pairs were successful based on at least one step of the primer validation procedure. Two major types of failed primer pairs that comprise most of the failures are primer pairs that failed on agarose gels but were successful by BLAST and primer pairs that failed on BLAST but were successful on agarose gels. 3695 primer pairs failed based on BLAST analysis alone and another 1864 primer pairs failed based on agarose gel analysis alone. In most cases a primer pair failed in one of the analysis steps based on the criteria, but was successful in other analysis steps. The failed samples did not overlap in many cases and this could have been in some cases due to strict BLAST analysis criteria and new splice isoforms seen on the agarose gels. Also, some primer pairs failed by both BLAST and agarose gel analysis, although these are numerically minor.

For the reactions that failed because no amplification had taken place, the template sequences may not have been present or present in very low copy number.</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of primer pairs that failed amplification using genomic DNA</title><p>From the high-throughput PrimerBank mouse primer pair validation, 1745 samples (6.5%) failed because of no amplification, as seen from the QPCR amplification plots. From the gene description information we found several to belong to olfactory receptors, vomeronasal receptors, transcription factors and low abundance transcripts while others were of unknown function or RIKEN sequences (data not shown). In order to investigate the possibility that the templates for the failed amplification primer pairs were not expressed in the cDNA sample used, we repeated these reactions using genomic DNA as a template. It can be difficult to achieve amplification using genomic DNA as template in general, due to its complexity. However, it can be used successfully if technical difficulties are overcome and can be useful as a universal template as it contains a copy of all genes, and the same amount of template is present for all single-copy genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We have found that enzymatic digestion (such as <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Bam</italic>HI digestion used here) can be used for reduction of the complexity of the DNA and thus higher amplification rates. We matched 864 primer pairs to mouse genome sequences obtained from the UCSC genome browser. The remainder of the sequences could not be matched, probably because they were located on exon junctions. 640 of these primer pairs have no <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Bam</italic>HI restriction sites in their expected PCR amplicons, and were used with <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Bam</italic>HI digested DNA template to prepare the validation reactions. We tested 192 representative samples, from the 1745 total number of failed primer pair samples, whose expected PCR amplicon lengths range from 60 bp to 123 bp and whose amplicons have no <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Bam</italic>HI restriction sites. 50 ng <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Bam</italic>HI digested 129 mouse ES cell genomic DNA was used per 25 &#x003bc;l PCR reaction.</p><p>The amplification plots of all 192 samples (2 &#x000d7; 96 well plates) are shown here [see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>]. The success rate of QPCR based on the amplification plots was high: 88.5% for the first plate [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>] and 90.6% for the second plate [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>]. However, Ct values differed significantly, from roughly 23 to 40 [see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>]. The location of the reactions on the plate did not explain this variation. The samples were also analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced (data not shown). Sequences obtained were BLAST analyzed and matched to the expected sequences, confirming that the correct templates had been amplified (data not shown). Therefore, these primer pairs had originally failed because their respective templates were not present in the cDNA sample used and not because of poor primer design, in general.</p></sec><sec><title>Uniformity of amplification and technical replicate tests</title><p>We next set out to determine the uniformity of amplification using fully validated PrimerBank primer pairs ie. primer pairs that had been successful in all steps of the validation procedure. 96 primer pairs were chosen with expected PCR amplicon length ranging from 80 bp to 120 bp and containing no <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Bam</italic>HI restriction sites in their sequences. Both forward and reverse primers were chosen to be on the same exon in order to amplify the same template on genomic DNA. <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Bam</italic>HI digested 129 mouse ES cell genomic DNA was used as template. After digestion the DNA was purified for PCR by phenol extraction and ethanol/salt precipitation. 50 ng of DNA template was used per 25 &#x003bc;l PCR reaction, which was found by optimization experiments to give a reasonable Ct value.</p><p>See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> for the amplification plots and dissociation curves. As can be seen from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, the Ct values for each sample are not exactly the same. This is expected since there will be some stochastic variation. Also, different primer pairs were used for each sample. However, the Ct values are similar, so amplification using PrimerBank primers appears to be relatively uniform. The statistical significance of the difference in Cts observed was determined by plotting a frequency distribution of the number of samples versus the Ct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). A statistical normality test was also used for the analysis of these Ct values, but the data did not pass this test. The effect of primer length and primer GC% on the Ct was studied, by plotting these values against the Ct, and no correlation between these parameters was found (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B,C</xref>). The effect of the PCR product <italic>T</italic><sub>m </sub>on the Ct was also studied, by plotting the <italic>T</italic><sub>m </sub>values against the Ct, and again no correlation was found (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). Since the expected PCR product size varies from 80 bp to 120 bp, some small variation in <italic>T</italic><sub>m </sub>is expected, and this can be seen from the dissociation curve data (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

Reactions were set up using the same 96 primer pairs and DNA template (129 mouse ES cell <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Bam</italic>HI digested genomic DNA) that were used for the uniformity of amplification test. The coefficients of variation for each 96 well plate assay are all &#x0003c; 0.1 and the average coefficient of variation for all assays is 0.07 [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>].

Variation in liquid transfer can only account for a small amount of the variation observed in QPCR reactions, and hence other factors must be responsible for the differences observed in Ct values.</p></sec><sec><title>SYBR Green I sequence specificity</title><p>The SYBR Green I dye has been widely used as a non-sequence specific dye for fluorescence detection of QPCR products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Studies of SYBR Green I-DNA binding showing some sequence specificity of the dye have been reported but these have not been conclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We investigated whether SYBR Green I is sequence specific by adding the dye to a series of amplicons and taking fluorescence readings. 8 amplicons of increasing length and 7 amplicons of increasing AT% [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>] were used, whose concentrations were accurately determined (see methods). From these experiments, we did not observe any length dependent or AT/GC dependent sequence specificity of SYBR Green I [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S13">13</xref>]. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that SYBR Green I can show specificity to sequences such as homopolymer regions of DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] or specific sequences. We also investigated whether SYBR Green I dye binding is sequence specific by estimating the number of PCR product molecules at threshold using the ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. For this, the same 14 amplicons as above were used and a template titration series of reactions was prepared for each amplicon. SYBR Green I threshold cycle (Ct) fluorescence will be the same for all amplicons (and all reactions), since the same threshold was used to compare all reactions. However, if SYBR Green I is sequence specific, this fluorescence will correspond to a different number of molecules at threshold for each amplicon. These experiments were inconclusive, as the stochastic error was too large to be able to accurately determine the molecules detected at the threshold (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Estimation of QPCR amplification efficiency</title><p>The most common method for the calculation of the amplification efficiency of a QPCR reaction requires preparation of a series of serial dilutions of the sample and creation of a standard curve, whereby efficiency is estimated from the slope of the standard curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, this method does not provide an accurate value of the efficiency, as the efficiency can vary between different reactions and as input concentration changes. A number of analytical methods have been described for the calculation of the amplification efficiency of a reaction from single reaction kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] (for a correction in equation 3 of this paper see: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. These methods can be more accurate and, when automated, less laborious compared to the standard curve method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Using the following analytical method, we estimated the amplification efficiency values for 13 QPCRs using PrimerBank primer pairs that had been previously used. The log2 fluorescence data was plotted versus the Ct number and the slope of the linear regression was taken to be equal to the efficiency of each reaction [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S14">14</xref>]. Cycle values closest to the Ct were used, as this region will be the most accurate. The efficiency values ranged from 79% to 96% [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S14">14</xref>]. Replicates can be used to improve accuracy when using either the standard curve or analytical single reaction kinetics methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>We compared amplification efficiency estimation using the standard curve and analytical methods in order to determine the accuracy of each method using the same 13 PrimerBank primer pairs as above [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>]. Either the log2 of pg of input template DNA data, for the standard curve method, or the log2 fluorescence data, for the analytical method, was plotted versus the Ct number. Ct was the independent variable and log2 of pg of input template DNA/fluorescence was the dependent variable. The slope of the linear regression was taken to be equal to the efficiency of each reaction. From these results the analytical method shows a smaller variance of efficiency values and the range is smaller compared to the standard curve method [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>]. One-way ANOVA analysis was done to determine if amplification efficiency varied significantly between different PrimerBank primer pairs, using each primer pair in a series of titration reactions of template DNA [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S16">16</xref>]. The average efficiency, standard deviation and coefficient of variation for each group of primer pairs are shown here [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S17">17</xref>]. The P value is &#x0003e; 0.05 (0.7338) therefore the amplification efficiency is similar between these groups.</p><p>In order to account for sample effects, it is useful to provide a model of the experimental measurement of fluorescent PCR product accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].

Most of the matched primer pairs (16356) are located within exons and at least one primer from the rest of the primer pairs is located on an exon boundary. Primers can be designed to be located on exon boundaries, in order to avoid non-specific amplification of genomic DNA during PCR, but in many cases it was not possible to design primers located on exon boundaries that fulfilled all of the criteria for primer design, most trivially because some transcripts consist of a single exon.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Primer pair location with respect to exons.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Primer pairs</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>F primer exon location</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>R primer exon location</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">16356</td><td align="left">exon</td><td align="left">exon</td></tr><tr><td align="left">(11235)</td><td align="left">(same exon)</td><td align="left">(same exon)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">1425</td><td align="left">exon-exon junction</td><td align="left">exon</td></tr><tr><td align="left">1576</td><td align="left">exon</td><td align="left">exon-exon junction</td></tr><tr><td align="left">311</td><td align="left">exon-exon junction</td><td align="left">exon-exon junction</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data from the UCSC genome browser were downloaded and used to find the location of 26854 mouse forward (F) and reverse (R) primer pairs with respect to exons.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Source of DNA template</title><p>A commercial composite mouse RNA preparation was chosen as the source of DNA template for QPCRs, which contains RNA from a panel of eleven different mouse cell types for a good representation of the majority of mouse genes. The composite mouse RNA is composed of total RNA from: whole embryo, embryonic fibroblasts, kidney, liver, lung, B-lymphocyte, T-lymphocyte, mammary gland, muscle, skin and testis. The success rate of the high-throughput PrimerBank primer validation experiments was high as seen both from agarose gel and BLAST analysis. We validated some of the failed reactions using genomic DNA as template, and found that most of the failures in which no PCR product had formed could be due to very little or no cDNA present in the source of DNA template. In order to increase amplification success, specific tissues may be used as sources of cDNA templates where expression of the genes of interest is known.</p></sec><sec><title>Primer specificity</title><p>The PrimerBank primer design was based on a successful approach for the prediction of oligonucleotides for the interrogation of protein coding regions by microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However the primer design differs by the addition of filters that are thought to be important for primer specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. All primers have been designed to work using a relatively high annealing temperature of 60&#x000b0;C and this temperature was used throughout the primer validation experiments described here. High annealing temperatures help reduce non-specific amplification. A high percentage of the total failed samples were due to undesired or multiple amplification, however this may have been for other reasons such as new unidentified genes or splice isoforms. In 3.9% of the cases where multiple bands could be seen on the agarose gel and in 14.6% of the cases where bands of other than the expected size could be seen on the agarose gel, no sequencing information was obtained. Also, 29.7% and 55.2% respectively, did not match to the expected sequences by BLAST. So, sequence homology existed in most cases of undesired or multiple amplification. From the genome-wide primer validation experiments presented here, we have found a high success rate of primer pairs that amplify the transcripts for which they had been designed. For primer pairs that failed because no amplification could be detected, we found that the reason for which they had initially failed was because their target sequences were not present in the target cDNA used. Another reason for failure in the high-throughput validation procedure, may be that protein coding genes in the human genome are fewer than previously thought, and the same may apply to the mouse genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A collection of potential new splice isoforms</title><p>As mentioned previously, larger than expected or multiple bands were visible on the agarose gel for some samples, however, sequences for these matched confidently by BLAST to the expected sequences. Therefore, the template sequences amplified in these cases could be new genes or splice isoforms. These unrecognized genes or splice isoforms may contribute to primer cross reactivity which results in a lower success rate on the agarose gels. Good primer design depends on accurate genomic information about genes and splice isoforms and it is suggested that many unidentified genes and splice isoforms could exist. All primer pairs that failed because of non-specific amplification, but when BLAST analyzed matched to the expected sequence, could have amplified new non-identified isoforms. This information would be very useful for other researchers, in addition to other strategies for identifying new genes and splice isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].

We have previously designed PCR primers for the human and mouse genomes, which are available from PrimerBank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The PrimerBank database currently contains 306800 primers for the mouse and human genomes and is tightly integrated with information from the NCBI databases. PrimerBank has been designed so that researchers can search for primers for their gene of interest using several search terms such as: GenBank accession number, NCBI protein accession number, NCBI gene ID, PrimerBank ID, NCBI gene symbol or gene description (keyword). Currently, all validated primers can be retrieved by searching PrimerBank. In many cases, alternative primer pairs for genes also exist in PrimerBank. NCBI sequences have been attached to the primer information page and NCBI LocusLink indices have been used internally for gene locus mapping.

We identified 17483 primer pairs that amplify unique sequences that correspond to distinct murine transcripts. All primers have been used under a common PCR thermal profile, allowing the experimentally validated primer collection to be used to evaluate the transcript abundance of a large number of genes in parallel. We used genomic DNA as a template to validate primer pairs that had initially failed by QPCR and provided explanations for the various modes of failure. We determined the uniformity of amplification of the QPCRs using 96 PrimerBank primer pairs. From the uniformity experiments, we found a small variation in Cts which could be due to differences in PCR product length and/or stochastic variation. However, overall amplification appears to be uniform using PrimerBank primers. We investigated the reproducibility of the QPCRs, using the same 96 primer pairs that were used for the uniformity experiments, by comparing Ct values between five technical replicate plates and found coefficients of variation to be low. In addition, SYBR Green I sequence specificity was investigated, using a set of sequences differing in length and base composition. We found no SYBR Green I specificity for the sequences used, but cannot exclude SYBR Green I specificity towards specific sequence motifs. Furthermore, we calculated the efficiency of the reactions from single reaction kinetics data and found the estimated efficiencies to be within a reasonable range, and also that the efficiency can vary between different templates. PrimerBank provides a useful tool for quantitative gene expression analysis by QPCR and facilitates high-throughput studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>High-throughput primer validation procedure</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotide synthesis</title><p>Oligonucleotides for QPCR were synthesized at Synthesis Core lab of Center for Computational and Integrative Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital.

DNA pellets were resuspended in TE pH 8.0.</p></sec><sec><title>QPCRs for uniformity, technical replicate and primer validation tests</title><p>QPCRs were performed in polypropylene 96 well plates on the ABI 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). For each reaction, 12.5 &#x003bc;l of Absolute Q-PCR SYBR Green ROX mix (ABgene) were added to 2.5 &#x003bc;l of 2 &#x003bc;M forward and reverse primer mix (final concentration of each primer is 200 nM), 1 &#x003bc;l of 50 ng/&#x003bc;l <italic>Bam</italic>HI/<italic>Eco</italic>RI digested genomic DNA and made to 25 &#x003bc;l with water. The following PCR conditions were used: 50&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes (step 1), 95&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes (step 2), 95&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, 72&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds (step 3 &#x02013; repeated another 39 times ie. 40 cycles in total), 72&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes (step 4). Dissociation curves were obtained by heating and cooling the samples at: 95&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, 95&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds.</p></sec><sec><title>Large-scale amplicon preparation for SYBR Green I sequence specificity experiments</title><p>Amplicons were prepared large-scale by PCR, in two steps. For the first step PCR, 75 &#x003bc;l PCR reactions were prepared for each sample. For each reaction, 37.5 &#x003bc;l Absolute Q-PCR SYBR Green ROX mix (ABgene) were added to 3 &#x003bc;l of 5 &#x003bc;M primer pair mix (final concentration of each primer is 200 nM), 3 &#x003bc;l universal mouse cDNA (see: 'preparation of cDNA sample' section in methods) and made up to 75 &#x003bc;l with water. The following PCR conditions were used: 95&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes (step1), 95&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, 72&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds (step 2 &#x02013; repeated another 39 times ie. 40 cycles in total), 72&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes (step 3). The PCR products were purified using the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified amplicons were used as templates in large-scale 40&#x000d7; 100 &#x003bc;l PCRs, each reaction containing 50 &#x003bc;l 2&#x000d7; LC1v3 buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH8.8, 40 mM KCl, 40 mM ammonium sulfate, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 &#x003bc;g/ml BSA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 400 &#x003bc;M dNTP mix, 2.5 M betaine), 4 &#x003bc;l of 5 &#x003bc;M forward and reverse primer mix, DNA template, 1 &#x003bc;l Taq polymerase and water to 100 &#x003bc;l. The PCR conditions used were the following: 95&#x000b0;C for 3 minutes (step 1), 95&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, 72&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds (step 2 &#x02013; repeated another 39 times ie. 40 cycles in total), 72&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes (step 3).</p><p>PCR reactions were phenol extracted and isopropanol precipitated. DNA pellets were resuspended in TE pH8.0. DNA was purified using Performa DTR Gel Filtration Cartridges (EDGE BioSystems), following the recommended procedure. Amplicon concentrations were determined by taking OD260 readings of each preparation using the ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop). The average value was taken and the OD260 reading from a no DNA template control was subtracted, in order to remove the contribution from primers and buffer components to the spectrophotometric absorption.</p></sec><sec><title>SYBR Green I sequence specificity experiments</title><p>DNA samples in 1&#x000d7; Absolute Q-PCR SYBR Green ROX mix (ABgene) were pipetted into OptiPlate-96F black 96 well plates (Perkin Elmer). SYBR Green I fluorescence was detected using the Analyst AD fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices) by excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 nm (505 nm dichroic mirror).</p></sec><sec><title>Robotic and manual liquid transfer test</title><p>5 &#x003bc;l of 10 mM dNTP solution were added to 95 &#x003bc;l water and the OD260 readings were taken using the Spectra Max Plus Spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec><title>Primer genome location analysis</title><p>Mouse genome sequences were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] and the primer pair sequences were matched by BLASTn to the genome sequences, to identify the primer locations with respect to exons.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AS designed and performed the experiments, analyzed experimental data and prepared the manuscript.
