Intrinsic disorder or flexibility of large macromolecular assemblies prevents the growth of sufficiently large regular lattices, which results in weak diffraction and/or extremely small crystals. It is therefore important to develop new experimental and computational methods that achieve the maximum possible information from such low-resolution diffraction data (limiting resolution worse than 3.5&#x02005;&#x000c5;).</p><p>In macromolecular complexes, the structures of some of the components may be known at high resolution, while those of others are unknown. Solving such complexes should be possible as the determinancy point, that is the Bragg spacing limit at which the number of independent diffraction intensities equals the number of flexible torsion angles, is generally in the range between 4.9 and 6.4&#x02005;&#x000c5;; for example, for a crystal structure with 50% solvent content the determinancy point is 5.4&#x02005;&#x000c5; (Hendrickson, 2009<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb12"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Thus, it should in principle be possible to determine all flexible torsion angles of a macromolecular crystal structure even at low resolution. Unfortunately, for a low-resolution diffraction data set, current methods require a high-resolution starting structure for the entire macromolecular structure (Davies <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb7"> &#x025b6;</xref>). In this paper, we describe our experiences with the structure solution and refinement of a difficult low-resolution crystal structure, the ATPase p97/VCP.</p><p>The ATPase p97/VCP consists of an N-terminal domain followed by a tandem pair of ATPase domains (D1 and D2). We obtained low-resolution diffraction data sets of p97/VCP in three nucleotide states (ATP at 3.5&#x02005;&#x000c5; resolution, ATP&#x000b7;AlF<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> at 4.5&#x02005;&#x000c5; resolution and ADP at 4.25&#x02005;&#x000c5; resolution; DeLaBarre &#x00026; Brunger, 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb8"> &#x025b6;</xref>, 2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> &#x025b6;</xref>) and employed molecular replacement using the known structure of the N-D1 fragment (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=1e32">1e32</ext-link>) as the search model; the structure of the isolated D2 domain was unknown at the time. Combined with selenomethionine (SeMet) multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing of the entire molecule, we traced the backbone of the D2 domain and the linker connecting it to the N-&#x000ad;D1 fragment. <italic>R</italic>            <sub>free</sub> values of below 32% were achieved upon refinement that included experimental phase information using the MLHL maximum-likelihood target function together with judicious use of noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) and secondary-structure restraints. Significant conformational changes could be discerned by comparison of the structures solved in the three nucleotide states. However, the secondary-structural elements of the D2 domain showed important deviations from &#x02018;typical&#x02019; ATPase structures solved at high resolution and the definition of secondary structure was poor throughout the model. The electron-density maps did not provide any clues to how to improve the model. We refer to these structures as the &#x02018;original&#x02019; p97/VCP models (&#x02018;obsolete&#x02019; PDB codes <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=1yqo">1yqo</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=1yqi">1yqi</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=1ypw">1ypw</ext-link>).</p><p>Subsequently, we solved the D2 domain alone at 3&#x02005;&#x000c5; resolution in a crystal form with 14-fold noncrystallographic symmetry, which produced a high-quality structure for this domain (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=3cf0">3cf0</ext-link>; Davies <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb7"> &#x025b6;</xref>). The revised model of D2, in conjunction with the high-resolution structure of the N-D1 fragment, was used as a starting model for re-refinement against the low-resolution structure factors for full-length p97/VCP in the three nucleotide states. The revised full-length models showed significant improvement in both model geometry and <italic>R</italic> values compared with the original structures (Davies <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb7"> &#x025b6;</xref>). We refer to those models as the re-refined p97/VCP structures (PDB codes <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=3cf1">3cf1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=3cf2">3cf2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=3cf3">3cf3</ext-link>).</p><p>The p97/VCP example illustrates that it is possible to refine low-resolution crystal structures to relatively high quality if the structures of all components or domains are available at high resolution. We first summarize a number of special considerations for low-resolution refinements and then discuss our experiences with p97/VCP.

All grid points of the mask are initially set to 1. Grid points of the mask within a distance of <italic>r</italic>               <sub><italic>i</italic></sub> around any atom <italic>i</italic> of the atomic model and its symmetry mates are then set to 0.

All grid points of the mask marked 0 are tested to see if they fall within a distance <italic>r</italic>               <sub>shrink</sub> from a grid point set to 1. If this is the case, the tested grid point is set to 1. This procedure effectively &#x02018;shrinks&#x02019; the accessible surface area.

However, for low-resolution refinement the optimum values can differ from one (DeLaBarre &#x00026; Brunger, 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb8"> &#x025b6;</xref>, 2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> &#x025b6;</xref>).

In order to blur the sharp boundary between macromolecule and solvent as imposed by the mask, resolution-dependent scaling in reciprocal space is applied using an isotropic &#x02018;thermal&#x02019; factor <italic>B</italic>               <sub>sol</sub>,<disp-formula id="fd2"><graphic xlink:href="d-65-00128-efd2"/></disp-formula>where FT denotes the three-dimensional Fourier transformation and <italic>k</italic>               <sub>sol</sub> is a scale factor that defines the mean electron density in the solvent region.

A straightforward application of least-squares optimization to determine the minimum of this expression results in numerical instabilities for structures determined at lower than 3&#x02005;&#x000c5; resolution. To avoid this problem, grid-search optimization has been used (Afonine <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb4"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Brunger, 2007<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb6"> &#x025b6;</xref>).

Both implementations (which are available in the latest versions of <italic>CNS</italic> and <italic>Phenix</italic>) are robust over a wide range of minimum Bragg spacings of the diffraction data, especially at low resolution.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2.</label><title>Treatment of weak intensities</title><p>With the emergence of maximum-likelihood-based refinement methods (Adams <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb2"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Pannu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb16"> &#x025b6;</xref>) it is possible to include all weak diffraction data in refinement. Clearly, this is especially important when analyzing crystals that only diffract to low resolution. Weak reflections with large experimental error estimates are automatically down-weighted in the likelihood-based target function. R. Read suggested using the resolution-dependence of &#x003c3;<sub>A</sub> as a guide to determine the effective resolution limit (Ling <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb15"> &#x025b6;</xref>). We applied this approach to set the resolution limit for p97/VCP in complex with ADP; the suggested resolution limit corresponded to a conventional <italic>I</italic>/&#x003c3;(<italic>I</italic>) cutoff of 1.2.

We observed slight improvements in electron-density maps upon the inclusion of all weak diffraction data in the refinement and map calculations. A possible generalization of this approach would be to take into account anisotropic diffraction since this is commonplace for crystals of large macromolecular assemblies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3.</label><title>Thermal factor sharpening of electron-density maps</title><p>Thermal (&#x02018;<italic>B</italic>&#x02019;) factor sharpening is a useful tool for the enhancement of low-resolution electron-density maps (Bass <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb5"> &#x025b6;</xref>; DeLaBarre &#x00026; Brunger, 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb8"> &#x025b6;</xref>, 2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> &#x025b6;</xref>, 2006<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb10"> &#x025b6;</xref>).

Although the resolution of the MAD phase data sets was limited (&#x0223c;5.5&#x02005;&#x000c5;), the experimental phases improved phase-combined electron-density maps such that backbone tracing of the D2 domain became possible (DeLaBarre &#x00026; Brunger, 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb8"> &#x025b6;</xref>).</p><p>During the backbone tracing of the D2 domain, polyserine helices were placed into the electron density in regions that had &#x02018;sausage-like&#x02019; character. The positions of the polyserine helices were refined by rigid-body minimization. These initial helices confirmed the expected structural similarity between the D1 and D2 domains. Using the homology to the D1 domain as a guide, the polyserine model for the D2 domain was further extended to produce models for the &#x003b2;-sheets and some information on loop connectivity. Using the known Se positions of the 19 methionine residues in each p97/VCP protomer greatly facilitated tracing, although in retrospect the Se positions were not sufficient to uniquely assign the backbone positions of the corresponding methionine residues, resulting in many register shifts of the polypeptide backbone (Davies <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb7"> &#x025b6;</xref>).</p><p>With most of the p97/VCP structure and the substructure of the anomalous scatterers determined, we performed iterative model building and refinement to improve both the p97/VCP atomic model and the parameters of the selenomethionine substructure. Phase probability distributions of the current p97/VCP atomic model were computed. Next, these model phase probability distributions were used as &#x02018;prior&#x02019; distributions to assist the maximum-likelihood refinement of the selenium substructure. New experimental phase probability distributions (without the prior distributions) were then computed from the refined phasing model and used to assist the maximum-likelihood refinement of the entire p97/VCP atomic model using the MLHL target function (Pannu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb16"> &#x025b6;</xref>; Adams <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb3"> &#x025b6;</xref>). This loop was repeated to convergence of the standard phasing statistics and electron-density map quality. NCS restraints and secondary-structure restraints (using tight backbone hydrogen-bond distance restraints for &#x003b1;-&#x000ad;helices and &#x003b2;-sheets) were applied during refinement. <italic>B</italic>-&#x000ad;factor sharpening to phase-combined electron-density maps yielded maps which enabled tentative assignment for &#x0223c;30% of&#x000a0;the side chains in the D2 domain. The phase-combined electron-density maps also allowed identification of the bound nucleotide as ADP&#x000b7;AlF<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> in the D2 domain and ADP in the D1 domain. Alternating rounds of positional and group <italic>B</italic>-factor refinement and manual rebuilding resulted in a final model with reasonable <italic>R</italic> and <italic>R</italic>               <sub>free</sub> values. Subsequently, crystal structures of p97/VCP in the ADP and AMP-PNP nucleotide states were determined and refined (DeLaBarre &#x00026; Brunger, 2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Tight NCS restraints were used independently for all subdomains (N, D1&#x003b1;, D1&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, D2&#x003b1;, D2&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;), omitting the inter-domain linkers. Experimental phase information was used in all refinements. The resulting structures exhibited reasonable statistics (<italic>R</italic> values in the range 30&#x02013;40% with good covalent geometry) but had many outliers in the Ramachandran plots. However, the electron-density maps did not provide any clues to how to further improve the model.</p><p>At the time, four full-length p97 structures were available in four hydrolysis states: ATP (from PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=1ypw">1ypw</ext-link>; 3.5&#x02005;&#x000c5; resolution), ADP&#x000b7;AlF<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> (from PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=1yq0">1yq0</ext-link>; 4.5&#x02005;&#x000c5; resolution), ADP (from PDB entry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=1yqi">1yqi</ext-link>; 4.25&#x02005;&#x000c5; resolution) and, independently, apo (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=1r7r">1r7r</ext-link>; 3.6&#x02005;&#x000c5; resolution; Huyton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb13"> &#x025b6;</xref>). These structures suggested that p97/VCP primarily undergoes motion at two stages of the nucleotide-hydrolysis cycle: between the ATP and ADP&#x000b7;AlF<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> states and between the ADP and apo states (DeLaBarre &#x00026; Brunger, 2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Three regions undergo order&#x02013;disorder transitions during the hydrolysis cycle: the D2&#x003b1; domain, the D1&#x02013;D2 linker region and the sensor-2 region of the D2 domain. Nucleotide-induced domain motions from the D2 domain are transmitted <italic>via</italic> the D1&#x02013;D2 linker region to the D1&#x003b1; domain (DeLaBarre &#x00026; Brunger, 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb8"> &#x025b6;</xref>). The D1&#x003b1; domain makes multiple contacts with the N domain and serves to regulate the motion of the N domain. Significant deviations from sixfold symmetry were observed for some of the subunits (DeLaBarre &#x00026; Brunger, 2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> &#x025b6;</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2.</label><title>Re-refinement using high-resolution structures for all domains</title><p>Subsequent to the publication of the original p97/VCP structures, a high-resolution structure of the D2 domain (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=3cf0">3cf0</ext-link>; 3.0&#x02005;&#x000c5; resolution with 14-fold noncrystallographic symmetry) became available (Davies <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb7"> &#x025b6;</xref>). This new structure, in conjunction with that of the N-D1 fragment ND1 (PDB code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/cr.cgi?rm=pdb&#x00026;pdbId=1e32">1e32</ext-link>; 2.9&#x02005;&#x000c5; resolution), allowed re-refinement against the low-resolution diffraction data for the full-length p97/VCP crystal structures. Although only a few residues were added to the models, the revised full-length models showed significant improvement in secondary-structure geometry, <italic>R</italic> values and electron-density maps (Fig.&#x000a0;1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> &#x025b6;</xref>). The free <italic>R</italic> values fell by as much as 5% compared with the original structure refinements, indicating that there is information in the diffraction data even at &#x0223c;4&#x02005;&#x000c5; resolution that objectively assesses the quality of the model.</p><p>The refinement protocol was very similar to that used for the original p97/VCP refinements, including the use of experimental phase information during refinement, NCS restraints and group <italic>B</italic>-factor refinement. However, no secondary-structure restraints were required to maintain good local secondary-structure definition. The availability of the high-resolution structure of the D2 domain was essential to obtain these improved structures since the electron-density maps derived from the original models were poorly defined in several regions (Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> &#x025b6;</xref>). In fact, for the re-refined structures, the improvements upon <italic>B</italic>-factor sharpening were more pronounced than for the original p97/VCP structures, more clearly defining side chains (Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> &#x025b6;</xref>). The regions that showed the most improvement in density were those that were less well defined, such as the D1&#x02013;D2 linker region. Inspection of the <italic>B</italic>-sharpened electron-density maps did not reveal any regions that were significantly degraded relative to the nonsharpened maps, so <italic>B</italic>-sharpening was maintained for model building.</p><p>The overall fold of full-length p97/VCP was unchanged upon re-refinement, although there were differences in detail, including many register shifts, which produced overall root-mean-square deviations (r.m.s.d.s) of 3.2 and 3.4&#x02005;&#x000c5; for C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> atoms relative to the original structures for the ADP and ADP&#x000b7;AlF<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> states, respectively. Many of the more significant differences between re-refined and previous models resided in the D2 nucleotide-binding site. In the original models of the site, conserved chemical features were placed in significantly different positions in each nucleotide state. For instance, the adenine rings in previous models occupied substantially different portions of the binding pocket, resulting in variable contacts between the ring and the surrounding protein and discrepant positions for the surrounding residues amongst the states. In the re-refined structures the conformation of the nucleotide and the contacts made with the adenine ring remained relatively unchanged across the nucleotide states.</p><p>The AMPPNP-bound p97/VCP crystal diffracted to the highest resolution (3.5&#x02005;&#x000c5;) of the full-length crystals, but even with fourfold NCS averaging the electron-density maps for this state were poorly defined in certain areas, the most significant of which was the D2 &#x003b1;-helical domain as we had previously noticed in the original structure determination (DeLaBarre &#x00026; Brunger, 2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> &#x025b6;</xref>). As a consequence, much of the D2 &#x003b1;-helical subdomain was still missing in the re-refined model, although the re-refinement helped to clarify several areas of poorer definition, such as the D1&#x02013;D2 linker region.</p><p>As had already been found in the original models, the ADP and ADP&#x000b7;AlF<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> crystal structures exhibit significant asymmetry; that is, they are each composed of three non-identical protomers per asymmetric unit. In the original ADP&#x000b7;AlF<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> structure the AlF<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> moiety was fully occupied in only one of the three D2 protomers, but upon re-refinement using identical symmetry restraints the nucleotide was found to be present in all copies with occupancies near one. Although the nucleotide-state and binding-site configuration were found to be the same from one protomer to the next, the relative arrangement of domains differed among the protomers in both crystals.</p><p>Our re-refinements of the p97/VCP structures confirmed the large conformational differences between nucleotide states and the asymmetry between protomers, in particular in the ADP state, that had previously been observed (DeLaBarre &#x00026; Brunger, 2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb9"> &#x025b6;</xref>). However, the re-refinement significantly improved the quality of the models, allowing more detailed analysis of the observed conformational changes between nucleotide states (Davies <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bb7"> &#x025b6;</xref>), which allowed the elucidation of probable mechanisms of differences in hydrolysis rates between D1 and D2, as well as the mechanism of transmission of nucleotide-state information between sub&#x000ad;units.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4" sec-type="conclusions"><label>4.</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our experience with the p97/VCP low-resolution crystal structures shows that if high-resolution models of most portions of the structure are available, they should be used as starting points for refinement. In the absence of such information, <italic>de novo</italic> model building is highly problematic at low resolution; our original tracing of the D2 domain resulted in many register errors even though some SeMet positions and homology were used as a guide during the model building. Compared with our original structures, the free <italic>R</italic> values, agreement with electron-density maps and Ramachandran statistics significantly improved upon the re-refinements starting from high-resolution structures. Thus, even low-resolution diffraction data contain information to objectively assess the quality of the model. These examples also show that atom-model refinement using the latest versions of refinement programs (<italic>CNS</italic> and <italic>Phenix</italic>) is possible and desirable even at low resolution. However, inspection of electron-density maps and current model-building tools fail to indicate how to improve the model (see, for example, Fig. 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> &#x025b6;</xref>). Thus, there is a need for the development of new computational tools to achieve the maximum possible and most accurate information from low-resolution diffraction data using all available prior information (<italic>e.g.</italic> from homology models) even if high-resolution structures are unavailable.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the National Institutes of Health for an RO1 grant to WIW (MH58570) and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for support to ATB.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Adams, P.
