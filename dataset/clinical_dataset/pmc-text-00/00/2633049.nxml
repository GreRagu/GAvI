These primary NS could be expanded in vitro by mechanical dissociation to single cells that generated new (secondary) NS, in a process that can be repeated many times. Furthermore, cells in each NS could be induced to differentiate into neurons and glial cells, thus demonstrating the two cardinal features of stem cells: self-renewal and multipotentiality. This initial report fueled many other investigations that further confirmed and substantiated the idea that neurospheres can be isolated from many other regions of the CNS of rodents and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Tropepe1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Palmer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Overall, these results suggest that the adult CNS has strong neurogenic potential, presumably due to the presence of putative stem and progenitor cells. The precise nature of these cells is still a matter of investigation and controversy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Morshead1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Lathia1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. It is assumed that under normal conditions, these cells are kept in a quiescent state by inhibitory signals, but can be induced to proliferate upon exposure to adequate growth factors, most notably EGF and FGF-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Palmer2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Kruger1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The recent finding by Markakis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Markakis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> that GnRH-immunoreactive cells can be derived from in vitro expanded adult progenitor cells prompted us to set up a NS assay using either fetal or adult rat hypothalamic tissue and verify if we could detect cells with GnRH-phenotype in these cultures. The advantage of the NS assay is that stem/progenitor cells can be 1) isolated and propagated in a serum free medium, 2) studied at clonal density, and 3) stimulated to induce the differentiation of the whole population of the growing cells. This method should also help to determine whether fetal CNS progenitors have the potential to generate GnRH neurons. Here we report that both the fetal and the adult rat hypothalami are a rich source of NS that can be expanded and passaged for a long time, with the capability to give rise to neurons and glial cells under differentiating conditions. In addition, we report the detection of GnRH-immunoreactive cells among differentiating NS derived from fetal cultures.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Hypothalamic tissue is a rich source of neurospheres with self-renewing capacity</title><p>Hypothalami were recovered from E18 embryos (Wistar rats) and after tissue dissociation, cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 5,000 viable cells/mL, and cultured in the presence of FGF-2 (20 ng/mL), which was suggested to be necessary for neural stem cell renewal during early stage of the CNS development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Ciccolini1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Tropepe2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. After a few days in culture, cell division was observed and small spherical cell colonies forming clusters begun to appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). At 7 days in vitro (7DIV), many clusters of different sizes ranging from small spheres to large colonies were formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Using the same culture system, NS were also obtained from adult (8 to10 weeks old) rat hypotalami in the presence of FGF-2. These were morphologically similar to their embryonic counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), but the number of spheres generated from adult hypothalami was significantly lower and their size were smaller. A comparison of the different yields between fetal and adult cultures is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>. Next we tested the effect of EGF, the other growth factor commonly used to induce the formation of NS and which appeared to control later stages of neural stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Ciccolini1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Tropepe2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In the E18 fetal cultures, EGF (20ng/mL) was as effective as FGF-2 after 7DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The use of both FGF-2 and EGF did not show any additive effect in these cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting that in the fetal hypothalami there is probably only a single population of stem/progenitor cells which is expressing both receptors. In contrast, in adult cultures, no NS were obtained in the presence of EGF at the 7DIV time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), despite the fact that the receptor for EGF (EGFR) was expressed in the adult hypothalamic tissue prior to culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> inset below graph). In fact, much longer incubation time was required (&#x0003e;3 weeks) to allow the formation of very few and small colonies (data not shown). Secondary and later passage NS derived from FGF-2-responsive primary NS expressed FGFR1, the receptor for FGF-2, but not EGFR (data not shown). CNTF and BDNF exhibit strong neurogenic properties in vivo in the hypothalamus of adult mice and rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Kokoeva1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Pencea1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we also tested the potential capacity of these two factors to support NS formation in our adult hypothalamic cultures. Despite the fact that the receptors for both molecules (respectively CNTFR/Gp130/LIFR and TrkB) were expressed in adult hypothalami prior to culture (inset below graph <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), no NS formation was seen after 7DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), nor after more extended time periods of incubation (until 3 weeks, data not shown). Overall, our results indicate that fetal and adult hypothalamic tissues are a rich source of cells capable of proliferation in vitro, upon stimulation with either FGF-2 or EGF, the latter being effective only in fetal cultures. In addition, fetal and adult primary NS could be passaged and expanded many times, by simple mechanical dissociation into single cells. A comparison of the rate of expansion of fetal vs. adult NS upon serial passaging is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>. These cultures were kept in the presence of FGF-2 plus EGF and NS counted after 7DIV, respectively before the 2<sup>nd</sup> (secondary NS), 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> passage.

To this end, we completely removed the ependymal layer and some of the tissue immediately surrounding the third ventriculum, before starting the culture preparation. This was accomplished by administering a dye solution (either methylene blue or DiI) into the lateral ventricle of anesthetized adult rats, subsequently removing the brain and then dissecting out the entire hypothalamus. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, in this case the dye methylene blue diffused and labels the third ventricle, making it easy to completely remove the blue stained third ventriculum, including some of the surrounding hypothalamic tissue (part underlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). DiI was also effective in staining (in red) the ventricular tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Therefore, the cultures derived from hypothalami lacking the third ventricle ependymal layer and surrounding tissue should be devoid of contaminating ependymal-derived precursor cells. Using this procedure, we were able to generate NS with the same efficiency as when the entire hypothalamus including third ventriculum was used (data not shown). In addition, these cultures had similar responses to growth factors as the previous cultures obtained from hypothalami containing third ventricle tissue: only FGF-2, but not EGF, was effective in stimulating NS formation. Immunofluorescence analysis of the NS obtained from DiI-injected animals showed that none of the cells within the NS incorporated the DiI fluorescent dye. In contrast, parallel cultures from ventricular tissue which had been stained with DiI failed to generate NS after a two-week incubation.</p><fig id="pone-0004392-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004392.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Representative images of brains sectioned after lateral ventricle administration with either methylene blue or DiI dyes.</title><p>A, Coronal section of adult rat brain injected icv with methylene blue, showing the dissected hypothalamus (HT), (LV: lateral ventricle), (3rdV: third ventricle).

The NS generated within each separate culture were pooled and processed in order to prepare RNA which was then used for RT-PCR analysis. For these experiments, we only used NS derived from passaged primary fetal and adult NS (secondary and tertiary NS), to avoid any possibility of contamination with cells derived from primary culture. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> shows the results of a representative experiment from adult NS (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4 samples from independent cultures analyzed), confirming the expression of all the cell markers assessed. These are compared to the expression of the same markers in RNA extracted from adult rat hypothalami (HT). Beta-2 microglobulin gene (&#x003b2;-2m) was chosen as housekeeping gene to verify sample quality and PCR conditions. NS isolated from other parts of the CNS could differentiate into neurons and glial cells when cultured under appropriate differentiating conditions, usually in media supplemented with 1&#x02013;2&#x00025; FBS but without the presence of the mitogens EGF/FGF-2. Therefore, we next verified whether the hypothalamic-derived NS could differentiate into both neurons and glial cells. Either secondary or tertiary NS were mechanically dissociated, and the resulting single-cells were cultured in a media devoid of growth factors but supplemented with 1&#x00025; FBS. Cells kept under this condition attached to the surface of vessels and started to assume differentiated morphologies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). A representative picture from immunocytochemical analysis of fetal cultures at 7DIV is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004392-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and demonstrates that the major CNS phenotypes can be detected, using specific antibodies for neurons (beta Tubulin III, red staining), and astrocytes (GFAP, green staining).

By supplementing standard hypothalamic primary cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Salvi1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> with growth factors such as EGF and FGF-2, we were able to reproducibly obtain large amounts of NS that can be maintained for a long period of time while retaining the capability of differentiating into the principal CNS cell phenotypes: neurons and glial cells. These data are in agreement with a recent report demonstrating the generation of NS from explants derived from small, anatomically-defined, subregions of adult rat CNS, including parts of the hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Chipperfield1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, these authors also found that hypothalamic explants were among the richest sources of NS compared with other regions of the CNS such as the hippocampus.</p><p>We found here that the different growth factors used in the cultures influenced differently the development of NS in fetal compared to adult hypothalami. In fetal cultures, EGF and FGF-2 were almost equally efficient in promoting the generation of primary NS, but without exhibiting any additive effect. This observation implies that the same population of progenitor/stem cells is responding to stimulation with either growth factor, suggesting the expression of their two specific receptors in the same cells. In cultures from adult hypothalami, generation of NS was obtained effectively and reliably only with FGF-2, despite our concomitant finding that the EGFR is expressed in adult hypothalami. This observation is nevertheless consistent with previous data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Xu1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, but its significance remains to be elucidated.</p><p>We were also able to demonstrate that these NS are derived from the hypothalamic parenchyma, at least in the adult rat cultures, since the entire third ventricle lining including its immediately surrounding tissue was removed before culturing. This point appears important because the ependymal and subependymal layers of the lateral ventricles were once believed to be the only regions where putative neural progenitors/neural stem cells reside <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Gage1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistently, more recent data show that the ependymal layer of the third ventricle also contains neuronal precursor cells capable of proliferation and migration within the hypothalamic parenchyma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Xu1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is now relatively well established that parenchymal tissue from different CNS regions such as the cortex, septum, striatum and the optic nerve contain quiescent neuronal progenitors that can be induced to proliferate in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Arsenijevic1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Palmer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Palmer2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In our system, the hypothalamic-derived NS cultures were able to retain some phenotypic specificity of their area of origin. We could notably demonstrate the expression of transcription factors essential for the differentiation of many neuroendocrine cell lineages of the hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Acampora1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Mastronardi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> in NS cultures from adult and fetal hypothalami. This result is entirely in line with the demonstration that neural stem cells and their progeny are regionally specified in the developing brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Hitoshi1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The postnatal hypothalamus has long been considered a neurogenically silent region with no proliferative capacity, but recent <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are challenging this hypothesis: in rats, the icv infusion of BDNF results in the accumulation of BrdU-positive cells in several CNS regions, including the hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Pencea1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. These proliferating cells are scattered in a large hypothalamic parenchymal area around the third ventricle, and many of them express neuronal markers. Similarly, the icv infusion of CNTF in adult mice is exerting a strong anorexigenic effect leading to long-lasting weight loss that is dependent upon the de novo generation of neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Kokoeva1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, CNTF-treated adult mice showed accumulation of BrdU-positive cells in the hypothalamus, especially in the ventromedial and arcuate nuclei, two areas involved in the control of feeding. The present data are therefore consistent with these studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Kokoeva1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Pencea1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and support the hypothesis that putative neural precursor cells/stem cells residing in the adult hypothalamic parenchyma are normally in a quiescent state, but capable of responding to stimulation by opportune exogenous factors such as BDNF and CNTF.</p><p>We therefore reasoned that CNTF or BDNF should have a similar proliferative effect <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, despite many attempts and the fact that the receptors for these molecules are expressed in our system, we never succeeded in generating primary NS when the two growth factors EGF or FGF-2 were substituted by either CNTF, BDNF or a combination of the two. It therefore appears that the putative CNTF/BDNF-responsive cells residing within the hypothalamic parenchyma are either not present or not capable of responding to stimulation in the primary neural cell cultures. One possible explanation would be that even though CNTF/BDNF is able to induce neurogenesis in vivo, it may not be sufficient to support all the physiological processes required for the in vitro generation of NS and that other factors may interact with CNTF/BDNF to promote proliferation. Another possibility could be that EGF and FGF-2 responsive cells are already committed for proliferation in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Craig1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Kuhn1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, and that they maintain this characteristic in vitro, resulting in a prompt response to stimulation. Other cell types may be less robust, or loose their commitment toward proliferation once away from their natural microenvironment.</p><p>We were also able to demonstrate the presence of GnRH-expressing cells among NS derived from fetal (E18) cultures when they were kept in differentiating conditions. This is somewhat surprising considering the embryonic origin of GnRH neurons, which are thought to derive from migratory cells originating from the olfactory placode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Schwarting1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. However, more recent data suggest that GnRH-expressing cells may have multiple embryonic origins, a hypothesis that would be consistent with the present results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Whitlock1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, data derived from transgenic mice expressing the LacZ reporter gene under the control of the GnRH promoter indicate that GnRH-expressing cells can be transiently detected in the forebrain during embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Skynner1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, GnRH-immunoreactive cells derived from in vitro expanded progenitor cells were also reported from either adult hypothalamic or hippocampal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Markakis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. For the latter studies, the authors used a density gradient centrifugation technique to isolate progenitor cells from either the hypothalamus or the hippocampus, and they were able to detect many GnRH-immunoreactive cells in the cultures originated from both CNS regions. They suggest that when put in vitro, progenitor cells are freed of the constraints of their embryonic origin and can therefore generate different subtypes of neurons than they would do in vivo. This hypothesis could possibly explain the present results as well, but our study differs from the previously published experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Markakis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> in the following ways: the techniques used for the isolation of precursor cells were different, and so were the conditions of differentiation applied. Another important difference between our study and that of Markakis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Markakis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> is that we could detect GnRH-immunoreactive cells only in fetal but not in adult hypothalamic cultures. Markakis et al. used 7 week-old Fisher rats to derive progenitor cells and we used Wistar rats, between 8 to 10 weeks of age, for the adult hypothalamic cultures. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that either a difference in age or/and in the genetic background could explain these discrepancies. Alternatively, GnRH progenitors may reside in the adult SVZ, which was not isolated in our culture system. Nevertheless, our data and these previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Skynner1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004392-Markakis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> together suggest that GnRH-expressing neurons could arise from central nervous system progenitor cells, but further work will be necessary to assess the functional significance of this observation.</p><p>In conclusion, we report here that using a simple and robust culture protocol, both the fetal and adult hypothalami are a rich source of NS that can give rise to cells of all three lineages of the central nervous system. This capacity of the adult hypothalamic parenchyma to generate NS does not depend upon the presence of the ependymal layer of the third ventricle, and the neuronal cells thus obtained still express specific hypothalamic molecular markers. Finally, we were able to detect GnRH-expressing neurons among cells derived from these fetal NS, and we therefore suggest that this culture system represents a useful model to study the molecular mechanisms of GnRH neuronal cell differentiation, a central process for the neuroendocrine control of reproduction in mammals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Hypothalamic dissection and NS cell cultures</title><p>Adult (8 to 10 weeks old) and fetal (E18) Wistar rats were used for this study (Charles River, Les Oncins, France).

Under a tissue culture hood, the hypothalamic tissue was washed 3 times in sterile trituration solution to eliminate residual blood. Mechanical dissociation of hypothalamic tissue was done by gentle pipetting up and down with a sterile glass Pasteur pipette. This procedure was repeated 3 times, each time recovering the dissociated tissue away from tissue debris. Pooled dissociated tissue fractions were then centrifuged (5 minutes at 700&#x02013;800 rpm) and resulting cell pellets suspended in 2&#x02013;4 mL (volume depending on the amount of starting tissue) of culture media (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 0.5&#x00025; B-27 and 20 ng/mL of either FGF-2 or EGF growth factors).

Fresh media to compensate for evaporation, together with growth factors, was added every 4 days.
