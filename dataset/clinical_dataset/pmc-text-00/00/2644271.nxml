Most of the pharmacological investigations of Moutan Cortex have been addressed to its central nervous system activities, anti-oxidative and sedative actions. Otherwise, there are few reports about the active compounds with anti-inflammatory activity of Moutan Cortex. The aim of the present study was to screen and identify bioactive compounds with anti-inflammatory effect from Moutan Cortex. With the aid of preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique, ethyl acetate and ethanol extract of Moutan Cortex were isolated into twenty-two fractions. Bioactivities of these fractions were evaluated by measuring expression of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) in rat synoviocytes subjected to interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;). Eight compounds were isolated from six active fractions and identified by HPLC/MS<sup>n</sup>. Purified compounds, paeoniflorin, paeonol and pentagalloylglucose resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1; synthesis and IL-6 production in synoviocytes treated with proinflammatory mediator.

Moutan Cortex is used to treat a plethora of disease classes such as atherosclerosis, infection and inflammation, among many others. A variety of compounds, such as paeonoside, paeonolide, apiopaeonoside, paeoniflorin, oxypaeoniflorin, benzoyloxypaeoniflorin, benzoylpaeoniflorin, paeonol and sugars, etc. have been identified and determined in Moutan Cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Many clinical and experimental studies have reported that crude extracts of Moutan Cortex have therapeutic effects on ischemic heart diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Further, recent pharmacological studies revealed that Moutan Cortex can inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and some paeonol glycosides exhibited radical scavenging effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Matsuda H <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) reported the isolation of five paeonol glycosides and their radical scavenging effects.</p><p>The synoviocytes cells are important part of joint tissue and can produce pro-inflammatory mediators that are key players in pathophysiology of arthritis. The occurrence of inflammatory reactions in the synovial membrane has been demonstrated as the initial motive of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), similar to the pathologic changes of osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). It has been reported that extracts from the roots of <italic>Paeonia lactiflora Pall</italic>, another medicinal herb with analogous chemical composition of Moutan Cortex, can possess anti-inflammatory effects on arthritis rats by modulating the pro-inflammatory mediators production and change the ultrastructure of synoviocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, the bioactive compounds of Moutan Cortex, which are potential to confer inflammatory mediator in cellular models, have not yet been evaluated.</p><p>Many <italic>in vitro</italic> cell models including tumor cell lines and macrophages have been used to screen herbal extracts for anti-inflammatory activity. An <italic>in vitro</italic> model, which can appropriately represent the joint tissue and allow monitoring of physiological markers in response to treatment agents, has been established in previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The aim of the present study was to screen and identify active compounds from Moutan Cortex with anti-inflammatory action. Fractions from the ethyl-acetate and ethanol extracts of Moutan Cortex were obtained by preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and assayed for their abilities of reducing expression of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;). Eight compounds in six fractions with significant activity were identified. Dose-dependent effects of three purified compounds, paeoniflorin, paeonol, and pentagalloylglucose have been studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant Materials and Reagents</title><p>Moutan Cortex was purchased from Hangzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Company (Hangzhou, China).

Although anti-inflammatory effect of paeonol on synoviocytes has not been reported, a recent study reveals that paeonol dose-dependently inhibited TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; formation in the rat paw exudates after carrageenan injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Chun <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) also reported anti-inflammatory activity of the methanol extract of Moutan Cortex in RAW264.7 cells after treatement with, lipopolyssacharide (LPS) and suggested that the anti-inflammatory effects were induced through the inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 expression by suppressing the phosphorylation of I-&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B. Therefore, the possible mechanisms by which paeonol exerts its anti-inflammatory effect may be associated with decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, NO and increased production of IL-10. Total glucosides of paeony (TGP) has been proven to be an anti-inflammatory extract by modulating phosphorylation of MAPKs from synoviocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Paeoniflorin and its derivatives such as benzoylpaeoniflorin and galloylpaeoniflorin are major components of TGP. Thus, it suggests that the possible mechanism for anti-inflammatory effect of paeoniflorin may be attributed to the activation of the MARKs cascades and other transcription factors. Pentagalloylglucose is a newly found component with anti-endotoxin effect both in endotoxemic mice and rats. The reduction of the endotoxin levels in rats tightly associated with the TNF-&#x003b1; level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Therefore, pentagalloylglucose might suppress TNF-&#x003b1; release in a dose dependent manner.</p><p>In recent years, it has been proven that extracts or compounds from many herbs may provide a safe and effective adjunctive therapeutic approach for the treatment of osteoarthritis and RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Tohda <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) has compared anti-inflammatory activities of six different species of <italic>Curcuma</italic> herbs in adjuvant arthritis model mice and found a most effective specie. Thus, it can be expected to find active compounds from herbs for the therapy of temporomandibular syndrome. Traditionally, temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is treated with conservative therapy. Some alternative and complementary therapy for TMD patients has also been introduced, including intra-articular injection of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and sodium hyaluronate (SH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). It has been reported that extracts of Moutan Cortex and paeonol can increase SOD activity in ischemic brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and cultured synoviocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The chemical and biological investigations carried out in this work lead to the detection of several active compounds in Moutan Cortex as inhibitor of pro-inflammatory mediator. Though the exact mechanism of action responded for the anti-inflammatory effects of those compounds still need further investigation, the result of present study offers a new way for the treatment of TMD.</p><p>To our knowledge, bioavailabilities of some identified active compounds are not good. However, Liu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) suggested that poor bioavailability of paeoniflorin can be significantly increased by other chemicals such as sinomenine and verapamil. It also reported that absorption of paeoniflorin after oral administration of the two herbal formulations was significantly greater than that after oral administration alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Therefore, bioavailability of the isolated compounds and their interaction on pharmacokinetics should be further evaluated in our future study to help design rational dosage regimens. It can be expected that new agents can be developed from extracts and active compounds with anti-inflammatory effect of Moutan Cortex for patients with temporomandibular dysfunction who fail to respond to conservative treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This project was financially supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30471900).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Determination of glycosides and sugars in Moutan Cortex by capillary electrophoresis with electrochemical detection</article-title><source>J Pharm Biomed Anal</source><year>2006</year><volume>41</volume><fpage>129</fpage><lpage>34</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16343840</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of Moutan cortex on dynamics of blood stream in ischemic dog model</article-title><source>Shanxi Medicine</source><year>1984</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>212</fpage><lpage>4</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pharmacological of cortex moutan and core</article-title><source>Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi</source><year>1997</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>214</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10743213</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rho</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Inhibition of production of reactive oxygen species and gene expression profile by treatment of ethanol extract of moutan cortex radicis in oxidative stressed PC12 cells</article-title><source>Biol Pharm Bull</source><year>2005</year><volume>28</volume><fpage>661</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15802806</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yoshikawa</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Uchida</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Kawaguchi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kitagawa</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamahara</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Galloyl-oxypaeoniflorin, suffruticosides A, B, C, and D, five new antioxidative glycosides, and suffruticoside E, A paeonol glycoside, from Chinese moutan cortex</article-title><source>Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)</source><year>1992</year><volume>40</volume><fpage>2248</fpage><lpage>50</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1423794</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B6"><label>6</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Matsuda</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ohta</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Kawaguchi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Yoshikawa</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bioactive constituents of chinese natural medicines.
