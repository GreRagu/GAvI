We investigated the upstream membrane-bound target proteins involved in PDGF-stimulated signal transduction in human lens epithelial cell (HLE B3), using specific inhibitors and transfected cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>PDGF (1 ng/ml)-stimulated ROS generation was measured using fluorescent reaction of DCFDA by confocal microscope in live HLE B3 cells. Western blot analysis was used to determine the activated MAP kinases in cell lysates. Specific inhibitors used in this study were: AG1296 for PDGF receptor (PDGFR); AG1517 for EGF receptor (EGFR); pertussis toxin for cytokine-binding G protein coupled receptor (GPCR); PP1 for Src-family kinases; LY294002 for phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K). Small GTP-binding proteins Rac and Ras were studied using transfectants of dominant negative Rac (Rac N17), Ras (Ras N17) or constitutively active Rac (Rac V12). Cell proliferation was quantified using BrdU incorporation method.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Inhibitions of PDGF receptor kinase, the docking protein component Src-family kinases, and the survival element PI3K all eradicated PDGF-stimulated ROS production and corroborated with the suppressed cell growth. These inhibitions also attenuated the activated ERK1/2, JNK, and Akt, all downstream targets of the above factors. Interestingly, inhibiting GPCR or EGFR also showed the same effect but to a lesser degree. Co-inhibiting receptors to PDGF and EGF with or without co-inhibiting GPCR eradicated the PDGF signaling system completely. Transiently transfected cells with plasmid from small GTP-binding proteins Rac N17 or Ras N17 diminished PDGF action in ROS generation, cell proliferation and MAP kinase activation, while cells with Rac V12 enhanced the PDGF effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data clarified the potential mechanism of PDGF signaling in the lens epithelial cells, in which concerted efforts of the upstream components of PDGF receptor kinase, Src-family kinases, PI3K, Rac, and Ras proteins are required.

This process is initiated by a burst of intracellular ROS generation stimulated by various growth factors and cytokines. ROS in turn participate and regulate diverse downstream signaling pathways leading to specific cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. One of the targets for ROS in vivo is the reversible oxidation of phosphatases, which together with protein tyrosine kinases are responsible for maintaining a normal protein tyrosine phosphorylation-dephosphorylation homeostasis in cell signaling in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>].</p><p>Studies have revealed that the likely source for ROS generation is the membrane-bound superoxide-generating enzyme NADPH oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. The activity of NADPH oxidase is controlled by a group of enzymatic components, including the small GTP-binding proteins Rac and Ras. Rac may be involved in regulating the levels of ROS after ligand-evoked activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>] or it may serve as an activator for cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>, which releases arachidonic acid from the membrane for cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Ras is known to act as a switch to regulate signal transduction pathways that control cell proliferation, differentiation, organization of actin cytoskeleton, intracellular transport and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Ras can be recruited and anchored onto the inner surface of cell membrane where it is modified and activated to Ras-GTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>], as a cellular redox regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>].</p><p>Among the various growth factors, PDGF is well-studied in many cell types and used by many as a model system. PDGF family consists of four gene products that form five dimeric isoforms: &#x003b1;&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;&#x003b2;, &#x003b1;&#x003b2;, CC and DD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Each isoform acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases of PDGFR&#x003b1; and PDGFR&#x003b2; inducing dimerization of receptors and autophosphorylation of distinctive tyrosines in the intracellular domain of the receptor. The specifically phosphorylated tyrosine allows docking and subsequent activation of a series of responding molecules containing Src homology 2 or SH2 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. These include Src family kinases, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C&#x003b3; (PLC&#x003b3;) and small GTP-binding protein Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. The specific binding of these molecules can initiate signaling pathways leading to cell proliferation and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. In response to PDGF stimulation, there is a crosstalk between signaling pathways leading to cell growth. For example, Ras and PI3K have been demonstrated to interact with, and mediate, each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Small GTP-binding proteins Rac, Ras, and Rho have also been proven to activate each other in several cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>].</p><p>In addition to growth factor receptors, the cells have G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) which consist of a group of integral membrane proteins. These receptors respond to diverse external stimuli and subsequently interact with their respective large G proteins to initiate various downstream pathways upon ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. GPCR is proposed to interact with protein tyrosine kinase receptor (PTKR) binding during growth factor stimulation, and subsequently activating Src-family kinases and other upstream signaling components. It has been reported that GPCR can combine with PDGFR to form a functional signaling complex in human embryo kidney cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. However, whether GPCR interacts with PDGF receptor in the lens is not clear.</p><p>Many of the PDGF isoforms are potent mitogens for lens growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>], including the recently discovered effective PDGF-D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>]. We have used the PDGF&#x003b2;&#x003b2; isoform in the past and found that human lens epithelial (HLE) cells responded to its mitogenic action, and that action was ROS-dependent. PDGF-stimulated ROS generation and the downstream signal transduction in HLE cells could be abolished when cells were preloaded with antioxidants or free radial scavengers. In addition, a range of low level exogenous hydrogen peroxide could mimic the mitogenic effect of PDGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>]. The membrane NADPH oxidase is known to be the major source of ROS in other cell types, and this enzyme has been found in both the lens and lens epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>]. Our preliminary studies have also shown that NADPH oxidase was the main source of such ROS generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. The mechanism of PDGF signaling is largely unknown. To continue our quest for the understanding of PDGF&#x003b2;&#x003b2; signaling in the lens, we focus on identifying the target proteins after PDGF receptor (PDGFR) binding and prior to ROS generation by using the PDGFR-rich HLE B3 cells as a model. The upstream factors included PDGFR, Src-family kinases, PI3K and small GTPase Ras and Rac. We also examined the possible crosstalk between GPCR and PDGFR, and between EGFR and PDGFR in the lens epithelial cells. Using both specific inhibitors, we found that inhibiting either PDGFR, Src-family kinases or PI3K prevented ROS production, MAPK activation or cell proliferation in PDGF-stimulated cells. Dominant negative Ras or Rac transfected HLE B3 cells switched off ROS generation and the downstream signals while constitutively active Rac would enhance them. Our data also suggest the presence of crosstalk between PDGF receptor and the G-protein coupled receptor, and also between PDGF receptor and EGF receptor in the lens epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Lipofectamine<sup>TM</sup> Transfection, Plus Reagent, pcDNA 3.1+ and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) were purchased from Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, CA).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>]. In brief, after loading DCFDA, the dye was removed and cells were washed twice with MEM-HEPES before image collection. Un-stimulated cells exposed to UV light (from confocal microscope) were used as the positive control for ROS reaction and dye-loading quality, while cells without growth factor were used as controls.</p><p>All confocal imaging analyses were performed with a BioRad MRC1024ES confocal laser scanning microscope.

Each image series was collected under the same system settings, such as the black level and the magnification, using 10% laser intensity and 0.5 s/frame (512x512) scan speed. Five random images were collected as determined under phase-contrast/transmitting channel for focus and confluence of cells within the frame (usually covering &#x0003e;90% areas of 512x512 image frame that yields about 90-100 cell per frame) at each of the given time points.

Data from five random images within a given time point were pooled and averaged again to obtain the mean fluorescence intensities.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment of cells by inhibitors</title><p>Cells were gradually deprived of serum as described above and then treated with various inhibitors before subjecting to PDGF stimulation. For the treatment of PDGF receptor inhibitor 6,7-dimethoxy-3-phenylquinoxaline (AG1296), EGF receptor inhibitor 4-[(3-Bromophenyl)amino]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline (AG1517), G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) inhibitor pertussis toxin (Ptx), Src family kinases inhibitor, 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl) pyrazolo [3,4-d] pyrimidine (PP1), or phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002), serum-starved cells were loaded with AG1296 (20 &#x003bc;M, 30 min or 2.5 h), AG1517 (1 &#x003bc;M, 2.5 h), Ptx (250 or 500 ng/ml, 1 or 2.5 h), PP1 (10 &#x003bc;M or 20 &#x003bc;M, 30 min), or LY294002 (15 &#x003bc;M, 30 &#x003bc;M, 40 &#x003bc;M, 30 min), respectively either individually or in combination prior to PDGF addition.</p><p>We chose these inhibitors as it has been shown previously in other cell types, the beta receptor of PDGF, the Src-family kinases, PI3K and GPCR are all initial downstream targets for PDGF-binding at the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>]. AG1296 is a potent and specific inhibitor for PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r59">59</xref>]. This quinoxalin-type tyrphostin acts as an ATP-competitive inhibitor of the receptor kinase, but does not interfere with ligand binding or receptor dimerization. However, it does affect the autophosphorylation of PDGF receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>]. AG1517 is a specific inhibitor for EGF receptor that acts by competing for ATP binding sites with EGF. AG1517 can rapidly suppress autophosphorylation of EGF receptor and therefore selectively impedes EGF-mediated cellular processes. PP1 is a potent Src-family-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r61">61</xref>], whose inhibitory activity appeares to act through ATP-competitive binding by interacting with the active site of Src tyrosine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>]. LY294002 is a flavonoid quercetin based compound, which can completely abolish PI3K activity by targeting the ATP-binding site of the catalytic unit p110 only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r64">64</xref>], and has no inhibitory effect on other ATP-requiring tyrosine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r64">64</xref>].

It become clear in recent years, that PDGF mitogenic action is mediated by ROS generated during the process for the downstream signaling transduction cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. In our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>], we demonstrated that the production of ROS in lens epithelial cells was triggered by PDGF, and linked with the subsequent transient ERK1/2 and JNK activations as well as cell growth. The current report not only confirmed our previous study but also further identified that PDGFR and its associated early binding proteins, including Src-family kinases, PI3K, and the small GTP-binding proteins of Rac and Ras, are essential elements for PDGF signaling induced cell proliferation. Our data suggest that the PDGF mitogenic action in human lens epithelial cells is regulated by the collective effort of these membrane-associated target proteins, similar to other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r71">71</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r75">75</xref>].</p><p>It is interesting that the inhibitor specific to PDGFR could eliminate PDGF-stimulated ROS generation, but could not inhibit ERK1/2 or JNK activation completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). This phenomenon suggests that the cell may deliver the PDGF signal via other receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r76">76</xref>]. It was shown in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells that PDGF &#x003b2;&#x003b2; could transactivate EGF receptor to form a heterodimer between PDGFR and EGFR, which contributed to ERK1/2 activation. These authors also showed that antioxidants or Src inhibitor, but not PDGFR kinase specific inhibitor (AG 1295), could disrupt this receptor heterodimer, indicating that PDGFR kinase was not involved in the heterodimer activity. Furthermore, PDGF could also transactivate FGFR-1 and released bFGF in smooth muscle cells to enhance cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r77">77</xref>]. It is likely that a similar transactivation may occur in HLE cells, and the residual P-ERK1/2 signal during PDGFR inhibition observed in this study may be attributed to PDGF transactivated EGF or FGF signaling. However, HLE B3 cell is known to lack bFGF receptors and has a lower number of EGF receptors than PDGF receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r78">78</xref>]. Thus, we speculate that the residual MAPK signaling could only be contributed from EGFR activation. Our current data did show that inhibition of EGFR negatively influenced the PDGF-stimulated ERK1/2, JNK and Akt signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>) while inhibiting both receptors terminated Akt signal and rendered severely suppressed signals of ERK1/2 and JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>). These data indicate that transactivation between PDGF and EGF receptors is likely functional in the lens epithelial cells.</p><p>It is intriguing that inhibition of GPCR by pertussis toxin, a G<sub>i</sub>&#x003b1; protein inhibitor, could partially suppress PDGF-induced ROS production, and the downstream ERK1/2, JNK, and Akt activations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>), albeit the inhibition was less effective as that of other inhibitors used in this study. This crosstalk between GPCR and PDGF&#x003b2;&#x003b2;-activated PDGFR is a novel finding in the lens epithelial cells. Recent studies have demonstrated a co-mitogenicity in a number of growth factors (for examples, EGF, IGF-1, and PDGF) to stimulate MAPK cascades via GPCR-mediated pathways in numerous cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r79">79</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r83">83</xref>]. This new signaling system, called integrative signaling, is distinct from the transactivation of growth factors mentioned above, as it works via intimate binding of the components in two receptors between the receptor of protein tyrosine kinase (PTKR) and GPCR. Activation of this PTKR-GPCR complex is mediated by cytosolic Src and other adaptor proteins, to initiate MAPK signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r85">85</xref>]. Disrupting GPCR would therefore destroy this complex and attenuate MAPK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. Indeed, we have observed a diminished MAPK signaling by co-inhibition of PDGFR and GPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>), more so by co-inhibition of PDGFR, EGFR, and GPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>), and a complete shutdown of MAPK signaling by inhibiting Src-family kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). All are indicative of the presence of this receptor-complex. If GPCR were associated with PDGFR binding through Src in our system, it would be reasonable to expect that inhibition of GPCR would affect the docking efficiency of Src and the downstream target proteins, including PI3K and MAPK pathways of ERK1/2 and JNK, as we have observed in this study.</p><p>Of all the inhibitors used, the PP1 specific inhibitor for Src-family kinases was the most effective as it could shutdown all three signaling pathways of ERK1/2, JNK, and Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). The inhibition was specific as p38 pathway was not affected. Src-family kinases are involved in many downstream signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>] and they are also involved in the above-mentioned transactivation of heterodimer of PDGFR and EGFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r76">76</xref>]. Therefore, the strong inhibitory effect of Src-family kinases by PP1 in suppressing ROS production, MAPK activations and cell proliferation observed in our study is to be expected.</p><p>The importance of PI3K in PDGF mitogenic action has been established in various cell types. Bae et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>] has demonstrated that PDGF-induced ROS production requires PI3K activation, indicating that ROS generation is downstream from PI3K. It is known that PI3K activates Rac, which is an essential active component during NADPH oxidase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Thus, both PI3K and Rac are necessary for ROS production. In our current study, the specific inhibitor to PI3K (LY294002) effectively eliminated the fluorescent production from intracellular ROS in HLE cells during PDGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Inhibiting PI3K also eliminated Akt activation as expected, but it had no effect on ERK1/2 and only weakly attenuated P-JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). It is known that activation of JNK is downstream from Rac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r73">73</xref>], thus, it is reasonable to expect that some inhibitory effect on JNK activation would occur. However, inhibition of PI3K may have limited effect on P-ERK1/2 as activation of ERK1/2 can be initiated from several sources besides PI3K, including Ras, and to some degree from &#x003b2;&#x003b3; heterodimer-activated receptor tyrosine kinases during GPCR activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r80">80</xref>].</p><p>Cells transfected with constitutively active Rac plasmid (Rac V12), showed a similar increase in fluorescence as the vector transfected cells (44-50%) during PDGF stimulation, but the basal level of fluorescence was considerably higher in the Rac V12 than that of vector transfected cells (data not shown). In contrast, cells transfected with dominant negative Rac (Rac N17) could not produce any ROS upon PDGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). As expected, genetic manipulation of Rac changed the up and down signals of P-JNK but had less effect on ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Dominant negative Ras also prevented ROS generation and shortened the duration of activated MAPK pathways, except p38, indicating that Ras occupies the initial stage of the PDGF signaling system.</p><p>Taken together, our data indicate that ROS generation, the downstream MAPK activation, and the cell proliferation upon PDGF stimulation require the concerted effort of the upstream membrane-associated components of PDGF receptor kinase, Src-family kinases, PI3K and the GTP-binding proteins of Rac and Ras. We speculate that GPCR and EGFR may also play a regulatory role in this process. These findings provide an insight into the mechanistic regulatory system for the complex PDGF signaling pathway in the lens epithelial cells. Our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>], which focused on the pathways downstream from the factors covered in this study, demonstrated that PDGF-stimulated ERK1/2 activation induced arachidonic acid release to facilitate ROS production from NADPH oxidase. We have thus proposed that the mechanism of PDGF stimulation may use a positive feedback loop of PDGFR-ERK1/2-arachidonic acid-ROS-ERK1/2-cell proliferation. Together with our findings on the regulatory components upstream from our previous work, we propose the following mechanism of PDGF signaling in the lens epithelial cells as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><fig id="f8" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>The proposed mechanism of PDGF signaling in the lens epithelial cells.
