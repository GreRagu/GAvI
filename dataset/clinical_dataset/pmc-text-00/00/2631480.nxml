The nucleosome is composed of a histone octamer around which 147 DNA base pairs are wrapped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Nucleosome positioning plays an essential role in diverse cellular processes by controlling accessibility of genomic DNA to regulatory factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In general, there are three main ways in which cells regulate nucleosomal influences on these cellular processes: chromatin remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], histone modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and incorporation of histone variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. High-resolution nucleosome positions across genomes have been identified in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These valuable data make it possible to understand how nucleosome positions are exactly determined in vivo.</p><p>The coordination of nucleosome positions is a complex process involving combined interactions among multiple factors. Experimental evidence indicates that certain DNA sequences have strong ability to bend and twist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Consequently, DNA sequences differ greatly in their ability to wrap around histones. The binding affinities can vary by several orders of magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Recent studies have used DNA sequence features to predict genome-wide nucleosome positions with modest success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], confirming that nucleosome positioning is partially encoded in the genomic DNA sequence. Yet it is less clear whether the underlying DNA sequence plays a uniform role in nucleosome positioning throughout the genome. Until recently, two studies have observed decay in contribution of the underlying DNA sequence to nucleosome positioning along the coding region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, while recent results collectively suggest that factors besides DNA sequence preferences also contribute to nucleosome positioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], they leave open the question of whether different determinants of nucleosome positioning have distinct influences on nucleosome regulation.</p><p>In this study, we investigated into the relationship between the degree of dependence of nucleosome positioning on the underlying DNA sequence and the mode of nucleosome modulation in yeast. We identified two typical promoter classes associated with high or low dependence of nucleosome positioning on the underlying DNA sequence, respectively. The two classes are distinguished by multiple promoter features. Strikingly, the two classes are associated with two distinct modes of nucleosome modulation. Our results suggest that the two distinct modes of nucleosome modulation are linked with the intrinsic sequence preferences for nucleosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Two promoter classes with distinct determinants of nucleosome positioning</title><p>The regular spacing of certain dinucleotide sequences is known to facilitate the bending of DNA around the nucleosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Segal et al. have predicted genome-wide sequence preferences for nucleosomes in yeast based on dinucleotide probability distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Using these data, we calculated the ratio between sequence preferences of each experimentally determined nucleosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and mean preferences of linker DNA surrounding it (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), as an estimate of the dependence of nucleosome positioning on the underlying DNA sequence: High ratios indicate sequence-dependent nucleosome positioning, while low ratios could indicate nucleosome positioning less dependent on the intrinsic DNA sequence (see methods). Interestingly, the ratios of nucleosomes covering transcription start sites (TSS) and transcription termination sites (TTS) are both significantly higher than those of other nucleosomes (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-99 </sup>for TSS and <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-94 </sup>for TTS, Mann-Whitney U-test). We focused on nucleosome positioning in the promoter region (1000 bp upstream of the gene in this study), and found that there were two subsets of promoters whose corresponding ratios are all greater or less than 1.01 (the median of ratios throughout the genome), respectively. This result indicates that nucleosome positioning at the two subsets of promoters is mainly or less dependent on the genomic sequence, respectively. We identified these two typical classes for subsequent analysis. Promoters were grouped into SDN (sequence-dependent nucleosomes)-enriched promoters or SDN-less promoters if their corresponding ratios were all greater or less than 1.01, respectively (510 promoters and 483 promoters respectively; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). We validated these two typical classes in another dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]: SDN-enriched and SDN-less promoters showed stronger and weaker positive correlation between sequence-directed nucleosome formation potential and experimentally measured nucleosome occupancy than the rest of the promoters, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The distribution of sequence preferences ratios for nucleosomes throughout the genome</bold>.

It has been reported that the well-positioned nucleosome, which is near TSS, establishes a barrier that positions downstream nucleosomes along the coding region using the principles of statistical positioning, with little contribution from the intrinsic DNA sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We asked whether a similar strategy is employed by SDN-less promoters. However, well-positioned nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] show no significant positional preference at SDN-less promoters (data not shown). We next asked whether the less sequence-dependent nucleosome positioning at SDN-less promoters is due to the low intrinsic DNA sequence preferences for nucleosomes. But our results showed that SDN-less promoters have significantly higher intrinsic sequence preferences than the rest of the promoters (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-28</sup>, Mann-Whitney U-test, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This result implies that there might be other regulatory factors that override the strong sequence preferences to position nucleosomes, resulting in less sequence-dependent nucleosome positioning at SDN-less promoters. By contrast, SDN-enriched promoters have lower intrinsic sequence preferences than the rest of the promoters (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-13</sup>, Mann-Whitney U-test, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of the intrinsic DNA sequence preferences for nucleosomes between both promoter classes</bold>.

SDN-less genes have higher transcription rates and absolute mRNA abundance, whereas of SDN-enriched genes are comparable to genome-wide level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In general, the level of nucleosome occupancy in promoter is inversely proportional to the corresponding gene transcription rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Strikingly, SDN-enriched promoters have significantly lower nucleosome occupancy than SDN-less promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). These results suggest that lower nucleosome occupancy can not guarantee higher transcription rate. We separately analyzed nucleosome occupancy for genes with high or low transcription rates in both classes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the difference in the level of nucleosome occupancy between both classes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) is mainly attributable to genes with low transcription rates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Interestingly, SDN-less promoters lack a substantial nucleosome-free region (NFR) directly upstream of the TSS that is prevalent in most promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. ~500 occupied proximal-nucleosome (OPN) genes, with relatively high nucleosome occupancy close to the TSS coupled with relatively low occupancy at a more distal region in the promoter, show higher mRNA expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. There is only a small overlap (~13%) in membership between SDN-less and OPN genes, implying that they capture distinct nucleosomal features.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Promoter features that distinguish the two promoter classes</bold>.

Transcription rates tend to decrease with increasing nucleosome occupancy at promoters for SDN-enriched genes, while this trend is relatively weak for SDN-less genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). For promoters with similar nucleosome occupancy between -1 and -0.6, SDN-less genes have significantly higher transcription rates than SDN-enriched genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). We restricted the analysis to promoters whose nucleosome occupancy is in this interval. We asked whether transcription factor (TF) binding information contributes to the significant difference in transcription rate. Indeed, SDN-less promoters are enriched with transcription factor binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] compared with SDN-enriched promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). Moreover, binding sites are highly localized in linker DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] at SDN-less promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>).

SDN-less promoters are enriched with delocalized (fuzzy) nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Analysis of nucleosome fuzziness measured in another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] reproduces a similar observation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). These results suggest that nucleosome positioning at SDN-less promoters is more dynamic. Nucleosomes surrounding TSS at SDN-less promoters show high fuzziness (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Moreover, for promoters with similar nucleosome occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] within the 150 bp upstream of the gene, SDN-less genes have significantly higher transcription rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] than SDN-enriched genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). One possible explanation is that high RNA polymerase II occupancy, which is generally associated with high rate of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], should exclude nucleosomes from more distinct positions (more nucleosome fuzziness) in the measured ensemble. Two H2A.Z nucleosomes flank NFR at most promoters in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. As expected, SDN-less promoters are depleted of H2A.Z nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), By contrast, SDN-enriched promoters are relatively enriched with H2A.Z nucleosomes and are depleted of 'fuzzy' nucleosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).

Importantly, SDN-enriched promoters are characterized by hyperacetylation, while SDN-less promoters tend to be hypoacetylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A</xref>). Different from other known modifications, acetylation can neutralize the positive charge of the lysine. As a result, acetylated histone tails are thought to associate more loosely with nucleosomal DNA than unmodified and methylated histone tails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We used a compendium of gene expression experiments in which various ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers were deleted or mutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). If the remodeler regulates a subset of genes, its deletion should cause a differential change in expression. We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistical test to evaluate the difference in the distribution of gene expression values between a subset of genes and the rest of the genes. SDN-less promoters are highly regulated by ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, while SDN-enriched promoters show very low sensitivity to disruption of these remodelers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p><bold>Two distinct modes of nucleosome modulation for the two promoter classes</bold>.

These results indicate that some nucleosome positions are mainly determined by the genomic sequence, while other nucleosome positions are less determined by DNA. However, it is still unclear whether these two nucleosome classes could possess different properties and might influence the properties of their located genes. To address this issue, we identified two typical promoter classes whose nucleosome positions are mainly or less dependent on the underlying DNA sequence, respectively. Importantly, these two promoter classes can be distinguished by multiple promoter features and modes of nucleosome modulation.</p><p>SDN-enriched promoters have lower nucleosome occupancy and lower transcription rates compared with SDN-less promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This is a very interesting observation since the level of nucleosome occupancy in promoter is generally inversely proportional to the corresponding gene transcription rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We suggest that nucleosome occupancy at promoter establishes the context in which transcription operates, while transcription apparatus specifies the rate of transcription. It is well accepted that TFs bind their targets in a dynamic manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. SDN-less promoters are enriched with fuzzy nucleosomes compared with SDN-enriched promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), suggesting that nucleosome positioning at SDN-less promoters is more dynamic. This nucleosomal dynamics may guide transcription factors to their targets sites in a dynamic manner, although SDN-less promoters have higher nucleosome occupancy than SDN-enriched promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>Histone modification has been thought to work in concert with ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling to regulate nucleosome mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but the two promoter classes employed distinct modes of nucleosome modulation: Hyperacetylation for SDN-enriched promoters and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling for SDN-less promoters. These observations along with high intrinsic sequence preferences for nucleosomes at SDN-less promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) indicate that they need to use more energy in the form of ATP hydrolysis to override the underlying DNA sequence to regulate nucleosome mobility. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling often alters nucleosome position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], probably resulting in less sequence-dependent nucleosome positioning and high nucleosome fuzziness at SDN-less promoters. On the other hand, SDN-enriched promoters need not use much energy (mainly in the form of acetylation) to loosen histone-DNA association partly due to their relatively low intrinsic sequence preferences for nucleosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Acetylation is unlikely to transfer nucleosome position directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], which may maintain the contribution of the underlying DNA sequence to nucleosome positioning at SDN-enriched promoters.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified two typical promoter classes according to the degree of dependence of nucleosome positioning on the underlying DNA sequence. Their difference in contribution of the genomic sequence to nucleosome positioning appears to be a consequence of their distinct modes of nucleosome modulation: hyperacetylation for SDN-enriched promoters and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling for SDN-less promoters. The adoption of distinct modes of nucleosome modulation by the two promoter classes may be attributable to their difference in the intrinsic sequence preferences for nucleosomes (see discussion), and may result in different promoter features. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling often changes nucleosome position, probably resulting in high nucleosomal dynamics (fuzziness) at SDN-less promoters, while acetylation is unlikely to transfer nucleosome position directly, which leads to the well-positioned nucleosomes (low nucleosome fuzziness) at SDN-enriched promoters. Our findings should facilitate the understanding of how in vivo nucleosome positioning is coordinated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>The identification of two typical promoter classes</title><p>For each DNA sub-sequence with the length of the nucleosome in yeast, Segal et al. have predicted its sequence preferences for nucleosomes based on dinucleotide probability distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The March 2008 version of dataset was downloaded from Dr. Segal's website. The data were normalized, such that their values are between 0 and 1. Lee et al. have experimentally identified genome-wide nucleosome positions in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We first mapped the sequence preferences value to each experimentally determined nucleosome, and next calculated the mean preferences for all nucleosomal-long sequences (except the one bound by the nucleosome) that are between the right end of its previous adjacent nucleosome and the left end of its next adjacent nucleosome. We used this mean value to represent sequence preferences of linker DNA surrounding the nucleosome. For each experimentally determined nucleosome, we calculated the ratio between its sequence preferences and mean preferences of linker DNA adjacent to it (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), as an estimate of the dependence of its positioning on the underlying DNA sequence: High ratios indicate sequence-dependent nucleosome positioning, while low ratios could indicate nucleosome positioning less dependent on the intrinsic DNA sequence. Previous studies have shown that the genomic sequence itself can explain ~50% of the in vivo nucleosome organization in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We focused on nucleosome positioning in the promoter region (1000 bp upstream of the gene in this study) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and found that there were two subset of promoters whose corresponding ratios are all greater or less than 1.01 (the median of ratios throughout the genome), respectively. This result indicates that nucleosome positioning at the two subsets of promoters is mainly or less dependent on the genomic sequence, respectively. We identified these two typical classes for subsequent analysis. Promoters were grouped into SDN (sequence-dependent nucleosomes)-enriched promoters or SDN-less promoters if their corresponding ratios were all greater or less than 1.01, respectively (510 promoters and 483 promoters respectively; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>To validate the two typical promoter classes, we examined the ratio between sequence preferences of a nucleosome and maximum preferences of linker DNA surrounding it.

We also used another dataset of nucleosome formation potential predicted from DNA features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and calculated its correlation with experimentally determined nucleosome occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] at each promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleosomal data</title><p>The positions of well-positioned and delocalized (fuzzy) nucleosomes were taken from Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. For the two promoter classes, we calculated the percentage of fuzzy nucleosomes, respectively. For SDN-less promoters, we calculated the positional distribution of well-positioned nucleosomes. The nucleosome fuzziness data was taken from Mavrich et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. For the two promoter classes, we calculated the average fuzziness along the promoter, respectively. H2A.Z nucleosomes were taken from Albert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To avoid confusion, we restricted the analysis to the 10% most scored H2A.Z nucleosomes in the literature. For both promoter classes, we calculated the percentage of promoters containing H2A.Z nucleosomes, respectively. Nucleosome occupancy in normal and heat-shock conditions were taken from Shivaswamy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. ~65% of all nucleosomes throughout the genome in normal condition were within 30 bp of their positions in heat-shock condition. For both promoter classes, we calculated the percentage of nucleosomes with drastic positional changes (greater than 45 bp) before and after heat shock. We also calculated the changes in the number of nucleosomes in each promoter between the two conditions. Turnover rates of histone H3 were taken from Dion et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which were normalized among all promoters in that turnover rates at promoters are higher than those in coding region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], such that their means are zero and standard deviations are one. The data of sequence preferences for nucleosomes were taken from Segal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], which were normalized, such that their values are between 0 and 1.
