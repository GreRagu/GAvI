Identification of the organism is quite important in themanagement of such patients. Histopathological examinationwith special stain can identify the etiological agent. However,identification of the species is not possible from histopathologicalexamination.</p><p>We report a case of endogenous endophthalmitis in aneight-month-old child. The histopathological examination ofthe enucleated globe revealed granulomatous inflammation andsubsequent staining by Gomori&#x02032;s methanamine silver stainingrevealed the presence of multiple fungal filaments in the globe.As the species identification was not possible by histology,nucleic acid based amplification method of Polymerase ChainReaction (PCR) targeting Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS)region was applied on the tissue sections. PCR detected thepresence of fungal genome in the tissue specimen. However, tocharacterize the fungus, the technique of PCR-based restrictionfragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using <italic>Hae</italic> -III enzymewas applied on the ITS amplified products. PCR based RFLPrevealed a cleavage pattern similar to that of <italic>Aspergillusfumigatus</italic>.</p><sec sec-type=""><title>Case History</title><p>An eight-month-old male child was brought by his parents inMarch 2006. The child had history of severe cough four monthsago. Subsequently, he developed severe redness, wateringand discharge in the right eye. His birth history revealed thechild was a full-term normal delivery. There was no history ofprenatal infection.</p><p>The child could not fixate or follow light with right eyewhereas the left eye could fixate and follow the light. Right eyehad conjunctival congestion, hazy cornea, an exudative massin the anterior chamber. There was iris atrophy. Intraocularpressure was low in the right eye and normal in the lefteye digitally. Fundus examination revealed no view in theright eye. Ultrasonography of the right eye showed vitreouscavity filled with moderately reflective dot echoes. Therewas no evidence of intraocular calcification. Choroid wasgrossly thickened (3.0 mm). No mass lesion or intraocularforeign body was seen. Axial length of the eyeball was 13.3mm. Computerized tomography (CT) scan showed the rightglobe smaller in size with hyperdense vitreous without anycalcification. Ultrasound and CT scan finding was suggestiveof endophthalmitis in the right eye. Left eye was normal inall aspects.</p><p>As there was no visual potential, the right eye wasenucleated. The globe measured 12 mm anteroposteriorly, 13mm horizontally and 12 mm vertically. Cross-section showedshrunken globe with disorganized internal structure. Choroidand sclera were thickened. Optic nerve head could not be seen.Central callote was submitted for histopathological examinationwhich showed a shrunken eyeball with thickening of the sclera[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>]. Sclera was infiltrated by inflammatory cells at the limbus,which was composed of lymphocytes and multiple histiocytes.Iris showed dense infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cellsand histiocytes. Lens was found to be shrunken with rupturedand folded lens capsule. Vitreous cavity showed extensivegranulomatous inflammation with multiple Langerhan&#x02032;s giantcells. Retina could not be identified. Histopathological diagnosiswas consistent with endophthalmitis. Special stains for thefungus by Gomori methenamine silver stain showed multipleseptate fungi with 90&#x000b0; branching suggestive of <italic>Aspergillusspecies</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>]. The PCR-based RFLP for species identificationrevealed a cleavage pattern similar to <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3</xref>]. Child was examined by an internist. There was noevidence of systemic involvement due to <italic>Aspergillus</italic> infection.No risk factor, intake of oral steroid or immunosuppressiveagent and malignancy was found. The child was doing wellafter six months.</p><sec><title>Molecular microbiological investigations</title><p>DNA extraction from paraffin section was carried out byQiamp kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturer&#x02032;sinstructions.</p><p>PCR targeting ITS region: The PCR was carried out accordingto the method of Ferrer <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> For a 50 &#x000b5;l reaction, 8 &#x000b5;l of 200&#x000b5;m dNTPs,5 &#x000b5;l of 10 X PCR buffer (5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,500 mMKCl, 100 mM Tris Cl,0.01% gelatin), 6 &#x000b5;l of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2,</sub> 10picomoles of forward primer, forward primer ITS<sub>1 &#x02212;</sub> 5&#x02032; tcc gtaggt gaa cct gcg g 3&#x02032;and reverse primer ITS<sub>4</sub> &#x02212;5&#x02032; tcc tcc gct tat tatgc 3&#x02032; targeting ITS region.

This technique has several advantages, it israpid (within 24 h), sensitive to pick up a lower thresholdof etiological agent and is specific, Moreover, this techniquecan be applied to cases in which histopathological study isgiven the first preference to determine the etiological agent.To apply this technique the organism need not be viable, themere presence of fungal DNA would suffice to determinethe specific etiology. Alexandrakis <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> have used PCRtechnology to detect the presence of <italic>Fusarium</italic> species froma panophthalmitis case. There are several nucleic acid-based amplification methods to determine the etiology fromparaffin sections. These include PCR, PCR-based RFLP, DNAhybridization and DNA sequencing. Of these techniques, ifPCR and DNA hybridization have to be applied, then specificprimers or probes for each medically important fungus hasto be used. It might include several runs of PCR to detectthe etiological agent. On the other hand, amplification usinga broad range of primers targeting the ITS region followedby subsequent RFLP analysis proves to be a cost-effectivemethod to detect the specific etiological agent. The resultsare specific as the cleavage pattern is unique for each type offungus. Hence in this study PCR-based RFLP has proved tobe a rapid and reliable tool in detection and identification ofthe etiological agents from paraffin sections.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ferrer</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Colom</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Frases</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Mulet</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Abad</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Alio</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Detectionand identification of fungal pathogens by PCR and by ITS 2 AND 5.8 s ribosomal DNA typing in ocular infections</article-title><source>J Clin Microbiol</source><year>2001</year><volume>39</volume><fpage>2873</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11474006</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alexandrakis</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Sears</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gloor</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postmortem diagnosis of Fusarium panophthalmitis by the polymerase chain reaction</article-title><source>Am J Ophthalmol</source><year>1996</year><volume>121</volume><fpage>221</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8623899</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back><floats-group><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Intraocular inflammation in the vitreous cavity (1x)</p></caption><alt-text>Figure 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="IndianJOphthalmol-56-65-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Gomori methanamine silver stain showing fungal laments in the vitreous cavity (x 200)</p></caption><alt-text>Figure 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="IndianJOphthalmol-56-65-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Electrophoretogram of PCR based RFLP on Internal Transcribed Spacer amplified products for species identification of fungus from paraffin section</p></caption><alt-text>Figure 3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="IndianJOphthalmol-56-65-g003"/></fig></floats-group></article>
