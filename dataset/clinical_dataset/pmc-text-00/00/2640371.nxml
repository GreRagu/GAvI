COPD is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Many people suffer from this disease for years and die from it or its complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Hoogendoorn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] estimated that the prevalence of diagnosed COPD, the number of deaths, and the associated health costs will increase during the next decade. In addition to the social strain, COPD also influences the patients' symptoms, function, and subjective health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>An important issue in understanding the complexity of COPD as an illness and thereby its management, is what determines the subjective health status of these patients. Wilson and Cleary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] suggested a model that clarified the relationships between biological and physiological variables, symptoms, function, general health perception, and overall quality of life, and the impact of the characteristics on individuals and their environments. This model indicated that biological and physiological processes affect the perception of symptoms, which in turn affects function, general health perception, and overall quality of life. However, these authors point out that this main causal direction in their model does not imply that there are not reciprocal relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Several studies of COPD patients have examined different associations between physiological variables, symptoms, physical function, and subjective health status. For example, de Torres et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] investigated differences in physiological factors and sex, and reported that women have better oxygen saturation than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In terms of symptoms, studies of COPD patients have shown that higher oxygen consumption is associated with improved mood, and lower predicted FEV<sub>1</sub>% is associated with more breathlessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore Cleland et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] found that older COPD patients report less anxiety and depression than younger. Anderson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] found that greater depression is associated with lower physical function. With regard to subjective health status, studies have reported that women suffering from COPD and older COPD patients report worse physical health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Other studies have reported that lower predicted FEV<sub>1</sub>% and functional exercise capacity and greater anxiety and depression are associated with lower subjective health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The abovementioned studies mainly investigated bivariate relationships between demographics, physiological variables, symptoms, physical function, and subjective health status, but lack a multivariate perspective on subjective health status in COPD. According to the biopsychosocial perspective, subjective health status cannot be explained by biological and physiological factors alone. Instead, subjective health status is the result of an interaction between physiological and psychosocial factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. COPD is a chronic disease, which must be managed rather than cured. Therefore, knowledge about what determines subjective health status in this group of patients is relevant for the treatment of COPD, and for the care and rehabilitation of patients. To this end, the aim of the present study was to explore the determinants of subjective health status in COPD by evaluating the relationships between background variables such as age and sex, predicted FEV<sub>1</sub>%, oxygen saturation, breathlessness, anxiety and depression, exercise capacity, and physical and mental health. Based on previous studies in COPD patients and the conceptual model of Wilson and Cleary, the following conceptual model is postulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A proposed model for the relationships between demographics, physiological variables, symptoms, physical function and subjective health status</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1477-7525-6-115-1"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design, sample, and data collection</title><p>This study had a cross-sectional design, and included 136 patients with COPD recruited from the outpatient clinic at a medium-sized hospital between August 2005 and August 2007.

The SGRQ is a disease-specific instrument for patients suffering from pulmonary disease. The questionnaire consists of 76 items divided into three components: 1) symptoms, 2) activity, and 3) impact. A sum is calculated for each component. Each of the scores ranges from 0 to 100, the lower scores indicating better health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The SGRQ has been translated into different languages and used in several studies of COPD patients, including in Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Only the symptom component, which measures breathlessness in terms of frequency and distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], was used in this study. The symptom component consists of 8 items including frequencies and distress of breathlessness in term of phlegm/sputum, shortness of breath, wheezing and chest trouble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Anxiety and depression</title><p>Anxiety and depression were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). HADS is a questionnaire developed to measure anxiety and depression in non-psychiatric patients treated at hospital clinics. The questionnaire consists of 14 items. Seven items measure anxiety (HADS-A) and seven items measure depression (HADS-D). The items are scored on a four-step scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). One anxiety and one depression scale are scored by summing the patient's responses. The scores range from 0&#x02013;21, with higher scores indicating higher anxiety and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. HADS has been thoroughly tested for psychometric properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and has been used in patients suffering from COPD and the general population in Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>(D) Physical function</title><p>Data on physical function were collected during the examination at the out-patient clinic.</p><sec><title>Exercise capacity</title><p>Exercise capacity was measured with the ISWT. The ISWT is a standardized progressive walking test used to measure functional exercise capacity in patients with cardiorespiratory conditions. The test requires patients to walk at increasing speeds up and down a 10-metre course. The speed of walking increases every minute and is controlled by audio signals played on a DVD. The distance walked is reported in metres and greater distances indicate better exercise capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

SF-36 is one of several generic questionnaires developed in the United States by the Medical Outcomes Study to assess subjective health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The questionnaire consists of 36 questions that measure eight conceptual components: physical functioning, physical role limitations, bodily pain, self-reported general health, vitality, social function, emotional role limitations, and mental health. The scores in each component and the total scores are transformed onto 0&#x02013;100 scales. Higher scores indicate better subjective health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. One physical health summary score and one mental health summary score were computed from the eight dimension scores. The physical health summary score is mainly based on the physical health, physical role limitations, bodily pain, and general health components, whereas the mental health summary score is mainly based on the vitality, social function, emotional role limitations, and mental health components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In this study, we used the physical and mental health summary scores. The questionnaire has shown satisfactory reliability and validity in COPD patients, and has been thoroughly tested for psychometric properties in several countries, including Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were analysed with SPSS for Windows version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Moreover, those with better lung function but more anxiety and depression reported lower mental health. These results also show that symptoms explain a greater proportion of the variance in subjective health status than do demographics, physiological variables, or physical function. According to the biopsychosocial model, no one single factor explains the subjective health status. Instead, it reflects the complexity of the associations between biological and psychosocial factors, progresses of symptoms, to clusters of symptoms, to syndromes, and finally to diseases with specific pathogeneses and pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>This is the first study to explore a multivariate perspective on subjective health status in COPD patients based on Wilson and Cleary's [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] conceptual model of biopsychosocial relationships to subjective health status. In this study, a conceptual model was established based on Wilson and Cleary's framework and previous COPD-specific studies. In the model, there is a unidirectional relationship between the biological and physiological variables, symptoms, and physical function, which leads to the subjective health status (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). According to Osoba [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], there is a reasonably strong correlation between the proximal components of Wilson and Cleary's model (such as symptoms and physical function) and a weaker correlation between the more distant components (such as the physiological variables and subjective health status). There may also be a bidirectional relationship between some components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. There is not necessarily a strong association between the objective physiological indicators of the disease and the patients' subjective experience of their health status. In this respect, studies of COPD patients have found weak associations between objective measures of disease, symptoms, physical function, and subjective health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><sec><title>Relationships between age, sex, and physiological variables</title><p>The results of this study show insignificant associations between age, sex, and oxygen saturation. Conflicting results have been found in previous studies. De Torres et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] found that women suffering from COPD tended to have better oxygen saturation than men. Conversely, Di Marco et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] found an insignificant association between sex and oxygen saturation. Insignificant associations between age, sex, and oxygen saturation suggest that the women and men studied were at the same stage of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Relationships between age, sex, physiological variables, and symptoms</title><p>The observation that older COPD patients report less breathlessness than younger is in contrast to Stavem et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] who not find any such association. This finding may be due to response shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Patients adapt over time in relation to goals, expectations and values, and their perceptions of symptoms may therefore change. Furthermore, the process of learning to cope with health problems is well-known in chronically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Older COPD patients may have suffered longer from COPD and anticipate illness as part of growing old. Moreover, health- related stressors may not produce the same reactions in elderly. Although older patients may have difficulties due to breathlessness, they may see physical and functional disability as result in growing older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The fact that women tend to report more anxiety than men is not surprising because there is ample evidence of a higher prevalence of anxiety among woman than among men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. That women report more anxiety than men is also consistent with previous studies of COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In this study, small and insignificant associations were identified between physiological variables and symptoms. These results are in accordance with previous studies of COPD patients, which found small and insignificant associations between physiological measurements and breathlessness, anxiety, and depression[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Relationships between age, sex, physiological variables, symptoms, physical function, and subjective health status</title><p>Patients with less breathlessness and depression reported better physical health, and those with less anxiety and depression reported better mental health, which is consistent with previous studies of COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However, it is surprising that lung function was not associated with physical health and that better lung function was associated with worse mental health. The same trend was observed in other studies of COPD patients, although the association was not statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The results of our study show that the association between symptoms and subjective health status was stronger than the association between physiological variables and subjective health status, and this supports the multidimensional impact of COPD on subjective health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, the fact that subjective health status represents something other than physiological and pathological factors is useful information for consideration in the treatment and care of COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>In this study, age, sex, lung function, oxygen saturation, breathlessness, anxiety, depression, and exercise capacity influenced subjective health status. However, according to previous studies of COPD patients, body mass index, education, social status, sleeping habits, and co-morbidity could be important supplementary factors affecting subjective health status in this sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This study is limited to some degree. The sample size was quite small, which restricts the number of factors included in the multivariate testing of subjective health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Because of the cross-sectional design, no absolute conclusions can be drawn about causality or the directions of the relationships between many of the variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The patients included in this study were awaiting participation in a pulmonary rehabilitation programme, and were thus not a representative sample of all COPD patients. The strength of this study is its multivariate approach to explaining subjective health status. According to the biopsychosocial model, subjective health status is associated with physiological factors as well as symptoms and psychosocial factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for clinical practice</title><p>The results of this study indicate that symptoms are very important to patients' subjective health status, which in turn supports the view that a pulmonary rehabilitation programme focusing on the management of symptoms, such as breathlessness, anxiety, and depression, is required to alleviate symptoms and increase subjective health status[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>A model that explains the relationships between different outcomes is important in clinical practice to correctly interpret the results of outcome assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. For example, if subjective health status is determined by symptoms and physical function, then symptoms and physical function should be treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In COPD, symptoms such as breathlessness, anxiety, and depression are usually evident before there is a reduction in subjective health status. However, it is more difficult to determine the causal direction between breathlessness, anxiety, depression, and physical function, and as breathlessness, anxiety, and depression may be caused by a decrease in function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When controlled for all variables, more breathlessness and depression were associated with lower physical health, and better lung function, and greater anxiety and depression were associated with a lower mental health, with symptoms explaining the greatest variance. These findings highlight the importance of rehabilitation programmes that focus on the management of symptoms in relation to COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SBB conceived and design the study, collected the date, performed statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
