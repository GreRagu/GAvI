Non-cancerous renal cortex tissue obtained from patients with clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (N) was at the precancerous stage where DNA hypomethylation and DNA hypermethylation on multiple bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones were observed. By unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on BAMCA data for their N, 51 patients with clear cell RCCs were clustered into two subclasses, Clusters A<sub>N</sub> (<italic>n</italic> = 46) and B<sub>N</sub> (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5). Clinicopathologically aggressive clear cell RCCs were accumulated in Cluster B<sub>N</sub>, and the overall survival rate of patients in Cluster B<sub>N</sub> was significantly lower than that of patients in Cluster A<sub>N</sub>. By unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on BAMCA data for their RCCs, 51 patients were clustered into two subclasses, Clusters A<sub>T</sub> (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;43) and B<sub>T</sub> (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8). Clinicopathologically aggressive clear cell RCCs were accumulated in Cluster B<sub>T</sub>, and the overall survival rate of patients in Cluster B<sub>T</sub> was significantly lower than that of patients in Cluster A<sub>T</sub>. Multivariate analysis revealed that belonging to Cluster B<sub>T</sub> was an independent predictor of recurrence. Cluster B<sub>N</sub> was completely included in Cluster B<sub>T</sub>, and the majority of the BAC clones that significantly discriminated Cluster B<sub>N</sub> from Cluster A<sub>N</sub> also discriminated Cluster B<sub>T</sub> from Cluster A<sub>T</sub>. In individual patients, DNA methylation status in N was basically inherited by the corresponding clear cell RCC. DNA methylation alterations in the precancerous stage may generate more malignant clear cell RCCs and determine patient outcome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is known that DNA hypomethylation results in chromosomal instability as a result of changes in chromatin structure and that DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands silences tumor-related genes in cooperation with histone modification in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that alterations of DNA methylation are involved even in the early and the precancerous stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). On the other hand, in patients with cancers, aberrant DNA methylation is significantly associated with poorer tumor differentiation, tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Therefore, alterations of DNA methylation may play a significant role in multistage carcinogenesis and can become an indicator for carcinogenetic risk estimation and a biological predictor of poor prognosis in patients with cancers. Recently developed array-based technology for accessing genome-wide DNA methylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) is now mainly used to identify tumor-related genes silenced by DNA methylation in human cancers. Subclassification of cancers based on DNA methylation status, which may reflect the distinct epigenetic pathways of carcinogenesis, and DNA methylation profiles, which could become the optimum indicator for carcinogenetic risk estimation and prediction of patient outcome, should be further explored in each organ using array-based approaches.</p><p>With respect to renal carcinogenesis, we have reported that accumulation of DNA methylation on C-type CpG islands occurs in a cancer-specific but not age-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), even in non-cancerous renal tissue samples obtained from patients with clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Although precancerous conditions in the kidney have been rarely described, from the viewpoint of altered DNA methylation, non-cancerous renal tissues obtained from patients with clear cell RCCs are considered to already be at the precancerous stage in spite of showing no remarkable histological changes and lacking association with chronic inflammation and persistent infection with viruses or other pathogenic microorganisms. Surprisingly, accumulation of DNA methylation on C-type CpG islands in such non-cancerous renal tissues has been shown to be significantly correlated with higher histological grades of the corresponding clear cell RCCs developing in individual patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). However, since in the previous study we examined DNA methylation status on only a restricted number of CpG islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), we were unable to conclude that genome-wide DNA methylation alterations in precancerous conditions generate more malignant RCCs. In the previous study, accumulation of DNA methylation on C-type CpG islands in clear cell RCCs themselves was significantly correlated with tumor aggressiveness and poorer patient outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). However, we were unable to conclude that the examined C-type CpG islands are the optimum prognostic indicator for patients with clear cell RCCs.</p><p>In this study, in order to clarify genome-wide DNA methylation profiles during multistage renal carcinogenesis, we performed bacterial artificial chromosome array-based methylated CpG island amplification (BAMCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) using a microarray of 4361 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) in normal renal cortex tissue samples, non-cancerous renal cortex tissue samples obtained from patients with clear cell RCC and the corresponding clear cell RCCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients and tissue samples</title><p>Paired specimens of cancerous tissue (T1&#x02013;T51) and corresponding non-cancerous renal cortex tissue showing no remarkable histological changes (N1&#x02013;N51) were obtained from materials surgically resected from 51 patients (RCC1&#x02013;RCC 51) with primary clear cell RCC. These patients did not receive preoperative treatment and underwent nephrectomy in 1999&#x02013;2006 at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. There were 34 men and 17 women with a mean (&#x000b1;SD) age of 59&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10 years (range 31&#x02013;81 years). Histological diagnosis was made in accordance with the World Health Organization classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). All the tumors were graded on the basis of previously described criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) and classified according to the pathological tumor&#x02013;node&#x02013;metastasis (TNM) classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). The criteria for macroscopic configuration of RCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) followed those established for hepatocellular carcinoma: type 3 (contiguous multinodular type) hepatocellular carcinomas show poorer histological differentiation and a higher incidence of intrahepatic metastasis than type 1 (single nodular type) and type 2 (single nodular type with extranodular growth) hepatocellular carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). The presence or absence of vascular involvement was examined microscopically on slides stained with hematoxylin&#x02013;eosin and elastica van Gieson. The presence or absence of tumor thrombi in the main trunk of the renal vein was examined macroscopically. RCC is usually encapsulated by a fibrous capsule and well demarcated and hardly ever contains fibrous stroma between cancer cells (panel T in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, we were able to obtain cancer cells of high purity from surgical specimens, avoiding contamination with both non-cancerous epithelial cells and stromal cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>DNA methylation alterations during multistage renal carcinogenesis.

Because DNA methylation status is known to be organ specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), the reference DNA for analysis of the developmental stages of clear cell RCC should be obtained from the renal cortex and not from other organs or peripheral blood. Therefore, a mixture of normal renal cortex tissue DNA obtained from six male patients (C9&#x02013;C14) without any primary renal tumor was used as a reference for analyses of male test DNA samples, and a mixture of normal renal cortex tissue DNA obtained from three female patients (C15&#x02013;C17) without any primary renal tumor was used as a reference for analyses of female test DNA samples.</p><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.</p></sec><sec><title>BAMCA</title><p>DNA methylation status was analyzed by BAMCA using a custom-made array (MCG Whole Genome Array-4500) harboring 4361 BAC clones throughout chromosomes 1&#x02013;22 and X and Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Briefly, 5 &#x003bc;g aliquots of test or reference DNA were first digested with 100 U of methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme SmaI and subsequently with 20 U of methylation-insensitive XmaI.

Test and reference polymerase chain reaction products were labeled by random priming with Cy3- and Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), respectively, using a BioPrime array CGH genomic labeling system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and precipitated together with ethanol in the presence of Cot-I DNA. The mixture was applied to array slides and incubated at 43&#x000b0;C for 72 h. Arrays were scanned with a GenePix Personal 4100A (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and analyzed using GenePix Pro 5.0 imaging software (Axon Instruments) and Acue 2 software (Mitsui Knowledge Industry, Tokyo, Japan).

However, the promoter regions of specific genes are not the only target of DNA methylation alterations in human cancers. DNA methylation status in genomic regions not directly participating in gene silencing, such as the edges of CpG islands, may be altered at the precancerous stage before the alterations of the promoter regions themselves occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Genomic regions in which DNA hypomethylation affects chromosomal instability may not be contained in promoter arrays. Moreover, aberrant DNA methylation of large regions of chromosomes, which are regulated in a coordinated manner in human cancers due to a process of long-range epigenetic silencing, has recently attracted attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Therefore, we used a custom-made BAC array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) that may be suitable, not for focusing on specific promoter regions or individual CpG sites but for overviewing the DNA methylation status of individual large regions among all chromosomes and for subclassifying cancers by hierarchical clustering.</p><p>With respect to renal carcinogenesis, several studies of DNA methylation profiles of genes involved in specific signal pathways in clear cell RCCs, such as the p53-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) and Wnt-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) pathways, have been performed. However, to our knowledge, there have been no published data on DNA methylation profiles for all chromosomes in clear cell RCCs revealed by array-based technology. In our previous study, we showed that samples of non-cancerous renal cortex tissue from patients with clear cell RCC were already at the precancerous stage with accumulation of DNA methylation on C-type CpG islands, in spite of an absence of marked histological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). In the present study, genome-wide DNA methylation alterations (both hypomethylation and hypermethylation) in samples of non-cancerous renal cortex tissue from patients with clear cell RCC were confirmed by BAMCA (panel N of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). We then performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on the genome-wide DNA methylation status of the non-cancerous renal cortex tissue samples, and as a result, 51 patients were subclassified into Clusters A<sub>N</sub> and B<sub>N</sub>. Corresponding clear cell RCCs showing multinodular growth, vascular involvement, renal vein tumor thrombi and higher pathological TNM stages were found to be accumulated in Cluster B<sub>N</sub>. Although subclassification of precancerous tissue by unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis on the basis of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles has never been performed for specific organs, our Clusters A<sub>N</sub> and B<sub>N</sub> can be considered clinicopathologically valid.</p><p>The significant correlation between genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of samples of non-cancerous renal cortex tissue and aggressiveness of cancers developing in individual patients indicated that it may be possible to estimate the future risk of developing more malignant cancers based on genome-wide DNA methylation status at the precancerous stage. Although kidney biopsy sampling for screening of healthy individuals is not clinically feasible because of its invasive nature, carcinogenetic risk estimation using urine, sputum and other body fluid samples may be a promising approach if optimal indicators can be identified by genome-wide DNA methylation profiling at the precancerous stage in the urinary tract, lung and other organs. Patients belonging to Cluster B<sub>N</sub> showed poorer outcome than those in Cluster A<sub>N</sub>, indicating that even patient outcome is determined by DNA methylation status at the precancerous stage.</p><p>Although altered DNA methylation on several CpG islands has been reported separately in RCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), subclassification of clear cell RCCs, which may reflect the distinct epigenetic pathways of carcinogenesis, has never been established on the basis of genome-wide DNA methylation profiling. Since clear cell RCCs showing a higher incidence of vascular involvement, renal vein tumor thrombi and higher pathological TNM stages were accumulated in Cluster B<sub>T</sub>, our Clusters A<sub>T</sub> and B<sub>T</sub> can be considered clinicopathologically valid. In our previous studies, we examined DNA methylation status on CpG islands for the <italic>p16</italic>, <italic>hMLH 1</italic>, <italic>VHL</italic> and <italic>THBS 1</italic> genes, and the methylated in tumor-1, -2, -12, -25 and -31 clones were examined in the same 51 clear cell RCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Correlations between DNA methylation status on each CpG island and our clustering are summarized in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgn268/DC1">supplementary Table SII</ext-link> (available at <italic>Carcinogenesis</italic> Online). The average number of methylated CpG islands was significantly higher in Cluster B<sub>T</sub> (2.75&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.67) than in Cluster A<sub>T</sub> (1.54&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.98, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01867318). Patients were considered to be positive for the CpG island methylator phenotype when DNA methylation was seen on three or more examined CpG islands, based on previously described criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). The frequency of CpG island methylator phenotype in Cluster B<sub>T</sub> (62.5%) was significantly higher than that in Cluster A<sub>T</sub> (16%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0174969). Genome-wide DNA methylation alterations consisting of both hypomethylation and hypermethylation of DNA revealed by BAMCA in Cluster B<sub>T</sub> are associated with regional DNA hypermethylation on CpG islands and participate in malignant progression of clear cell RCCs. Moreover, patients belonging to Cluster B<sub>T</sub> showed poorer outcome than those in Cluster A<sub>T</sub>, indicating that prognostication of clear cell RCCs using DNA methylation status as an indicator is a promising approach.</p><p>Some RCCs relapse and metastasize to distant organs, even if resection has been considered complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Recently, immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) and novel targeting agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>) have been developed for treatment of RCC. However, unless relapsed or metastasized tumors are diagnosed early by close follow-up, the effectiveness of any therapy is very restricted. Therefore, to assist close follow-up of patients who have undergone nephrectomy and are still at risk of recurrence and metastasis, prognostic indicators have been explored. Multivariate analysis revealed that belonging to Cluster B<sub>T</sub> was an independent predictor of recurrence. It is known that sarcomatoid RCCs with grade 4 atypia frequently show recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). However, patients with RCCs showing grade 1&#x02013;3 atypia also suffer recurrence, and we cannot estimate the risk of recurrence of such RCCs based on known parameters. Belonging to Cluster B<sub>T</sub> is advantageous even to patients with RCCs showing grade 1&#x02013;3 atypia because it is a predictor of recurrence that is independent of histological grading. For clinical application, a combination of several BAC clones from the 70 that showed 100% sensitivity and 90 or &#x0003e;90% specificity (including 14 BAC clones showing 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity) can be of optimal prognostic value for patients with clear cell RCCs. Since a sufficient quantity of good-quality DNA can be obtained from each nephrectomy specimen, polymerase chain reaction-based analyses focusing on individual CpG sites are not always required. Array-based analysis that overviews aberrant DNA methylation of each BAC region is immediately applicable to routine laboratory examinations for prognostication after nephrectomy. We are currently attempting to prepare a mini-array harboring some of the 70 BAC clones. The reliability of such prognostication will need to be validated in a prospective study.</p><p>We have clarified that genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of non-cancerous renal cortex tissue are inherited by the corresponding clear cell RCC based on the following findings: (i) all patients belonging to Cluster B<sub>N</sub> were included in Cluster B<sub>T</sub>; (ii) a majority of the BAC clones characterizing Cluster B<sub>N</sub> (724 BAC clones) also characterized Cluster B<sub>T</sub>; (iii) DNA methylation status on such 724 BAC clones of non-cancerous renal cortex tissue in Cluster A<sub>N</sub> was in accordance with that of clear cell RCCs in Cluster A<sub>T</sub> and that of non-cancerous renal cortex tissue in Cluster B<sub>N</sub> was in accordance with that of clear cell RCCs in Cluster B<sub>T</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and (iv) DNA methylation status in non-cancerous renal cortex tissue basically corresponded to that in the matching clear cell RCC in each patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Patients RCC6&#x02013;RCC8 who belonged to Cluster B<sub>T</sub> but not to Cluster B<sub>N</sub> may later gain the DNA methylation profiles observed in patients RCC1&#x02013;RCC5 during the establishment of clear cell RCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and suffer from the same degree of tumor aggressiveness as patients RCC1&#x02013;RCC5. Although alterations of DNA methylation are considered to be involved even in the precancerous stage in various organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>), it has not yet been clarified for any organ whether DNA methylation status on only a restricted number of CpG islands is simply altered at such stages or whether genome-wide alterations of DNA methylation status have certain clinicopathological significance. The present unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed for the first time that DNA methylation alterations in precancerous conditions, which may not occur randomly but are prone to further accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations, can generate more malignant cancers and even determine the ultimate patient outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgn268/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgn268/DC1">Tables SI</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bgn268/DC1">SII</ext-link> can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/">http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Grant-in-Aid for the Third Term Comprehensive 10-Year Strategy for Cancer Control from the <grant-sponsor>Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan</grant-sponsor>; Grant-in-Aid for Cancer Research from the <grant-sponsor>Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan</grant-sponsor>; <grant-sponsor>New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization</grant-sponsor>; <grant-sponsor>Program for Promotion of Fundamental Studies in Health Sciences of the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation</grant-sponsor>.
