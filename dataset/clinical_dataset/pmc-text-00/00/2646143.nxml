A common side effect of irradiation to the neck and neck region is xerostomia caused by salivary gland dysfunction. Approximately 40,000 new cases of xerostomia result from radiation treatment in the United States each year. The ensuing salivary gland hypofunction results in significant morbidity and diminishes the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapies as well as the quality of life for these patients. Previous studies in a rat model have shown no correlation between induction of apoptosis in the salivary gland and either the immediate or chronic decrease in salivary function following &#x003b3;-radiation treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Finding</title><p>A significant level of apoptosis can be detected in the salivary glands of FVB mice following &#x003b3;-radiation treatment of the head and neck and this apoptosis is suppressed in transgenic mice expressing an activated mutant of Akt (myr-Akt1). Importantly, this suppression of apoptosis in myr-Akt1 mice preserves salivary function, as measured by saliva output, three and thirty days after &#x003b3;-radiation treatment. In order to translate these studies into a preclinal model we found that intravenous injection of IGF1 stimulated activation of endogenous Akt in the salivary glands <italic>in vivo</italic>. A single injection of IGF1 prior to exposure to &#x003b3;-radiation diminishes salivary acinar cell apoptosis and completely preserves salivary gland function three and thirty days following irradiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These studies suggest that apoptosis of salivary acinar cells underlies salivary gland hypofunction occurring secondary to radiation of the head and neck region. Targeted delivery of IGF1 to the salivary gland of patients receiving head and neck irradiation may be useful in reducing or eliminating xerostomia and restoring quality of life to these patients.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The effects of &#x003b3;-radiation upon the salivary gland have been known for over ninety years having been first described in the human in 1911 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Bergonine1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Radiation-induced damage to the salivary glands results in xerostomia (dry mouth), and affected patients have both compromised quantity and quality of saliva that can affect the emotional and systemic well-being of these individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Wright1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Such patients suffer from increased oral infections, difficulty in speaking, difficulty in swallowing food, and problems with digestion. In the human, the parotid gland is more radiosensitive when compared to the submandibular gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Baum1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Kashiima1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

The high sensitivity of the parotid gland has been suggested to be due to the predominance of serous cells in this gland as these epithelial cells appear to be the most radiosensitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Baum1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Kashiima1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While numerous experimental models have been used to study the effects of irradiation upon the salivary gland, the rat is the most extensively studied. Prior studies have suggested that damage to the salivary gland occurs in multiple phases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Zeiilstra1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Coppes1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The acute phases (0&#x02013;60 days) are characterized by a significant decline in salivary flow rate to approximately 50&#x00025; of control, loss of glandular wet weight and acinar cells, and alterations in water and protein composition of saliva. In the chronic phases (60&#x02013;240 days), cell number and protein secretion remain unchanged from the acute phase, while salivary flow are approximately 30&#x00025; of control values &#x0005b;reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Nagler1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>While there is an appreciation for the changes that are induced on the cellular and physiological level, the molecular mechanism underlying these changes are not understood, and most investigators have suggested that necrosis is responsible for salivary gland hypofunction. Apoptosis has been discounted as causative because a single study in rats has shown that less than 2&#x00025; of salivary acinar cells are apoptotic six hours following irradiation of rat salivary glands with X-rays with doses as high as 25 Gy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Paardekooper1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These results seemed at variance with the observed 50&#x00025; decrease in salivary flow rate detected by three days after x-irradiation at doses of 15 Gy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Paardekooper1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and thus these investigators concluded that radiation-induced apoptosis was not causally related to salivary gland dysfunction.</p><p>While there are many molecules that are able to suppress apoptosis, we have focused upon the anti-apoptotic protein kinase Akt which is able to suppress apoptosis in a number of cell systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Datta1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Kandel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Expression of constitutively activated Akt1 in transgenic mice (myr-Akt1) can reduce apoptosis by 70&#x00025; following targeted head and neck &#x003b3;-radiation suggesting that apoptosis may have a larger role in &#x003b3;-radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction than originally reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Limesand2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. We report in this study that reduction of &#x003b3;-radiation-induced apoptosis correlates with improved salivary flow rates in mice. Importantly, a single injection of recombinant IGF1, which stimulates activation of endogenous Akt, completely prevents loss of saliva production 30 days post-irradiation. This suggests a model for the development of a clinical approach to suppress salivary gland dysfunction and thus improve the quality of life in patients undergoing therapeutic head and neck radiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reduced apoptosis in myr-Akt1 parotid glands following exposure to ionizing radiation</title><p>We have previously described the phenotype of transgenic mice that express the myr-Akt1 transgene in either the mammary gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Schwertfeger1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, or the salivary gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Limesand2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we have evaluated the extent of apoptosis in the parotid salivary gland following exposure of the head and neck region of control FVB and myr-Akt1 transgenic mice to increasing doses of &#x003b3;-radiation. Analysis focused on the parotid salivary gland due to its high sensitivity to radiation and its functional importance in stimulated salivary flow. Apoptosis was quantified using immunohistochemical staining for activated caspase-3. Twenty-four hours after treatment, a significant (p&#x02264;0.05) level of apoptosis is detected in FVB control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004663-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) exposed to 0.5, 1 and 5 Gy doses of radiation that appears to be dose dependent. Approximately 2.4&#x00025; of the parotid salivary cells are positive for activated caspase-3 following exposure to 0.5 Gy, 13&#x00025; of the parotid salivary cells are positive for activated caspase-3 following exposure to 1 Gy and 27&#x00025; are caspase-3 positive following exposure to 5 Gy &#x003b3;-radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004663-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

The number of apoptotic cells was quantitated at 24 hour intervals following head and neck irradiation. The highest level of apoptosis in the irradiated parotid glands is observed at 24 hours post treatment and decreasing numbers of apoptotic cells are detected at the subsequent times examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004663-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Akt significantly (p&#x02264;0.05) suppresses the early induction of apoptosis (24 hr) when compared to FVB mice at the same time point. The level of apoptosis returns to untreated levels by 48&#x02013;96 hours and no significant (p&#x02264;0.05) differences are observed between FVB and myr-Akt1 mice. This suggests that Akt diminishes the overall cell death in the tissue rather than delaying cell death.

The significant differences in apoptosis detected between myr-Akt1 transgenic mice and FVB control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004663-g001">Figure 1</xref>) stimulated us to ask whether there was a difference in salivary flow rate between these two strains of mice. A significant decrease (40&#x02013;62&#x00025;) in salivary flow is detected in FVB control mice at each dose of radiation examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004663-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

Expression of activated myr-Akt1, or pretreatment of mice with recombinant IGF1, which activates Akt, significantly decreases the number of apoptotic cells, and significantly suppresses radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction. We note that there is a significant difference in the extent of protection offered by expression of activated Akt versus that afforded by injection of IGF1 with the latter providing significantly greater protection. IGF1 is able to activate a broader spectrum of signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase pathway, and its greater protection may reflect its ability to both suppress apoptosis as well as induce proliferation of cells. We suggest that this difference may account for the greater protection from irradiation-induced salivary hypofunction offered by IGF1. Furthermore, our results indicate that means to suppress apoptosis in salivary epithelial cells could prevent inadvertent salivary gland dysfunction occurring secondary to head and neck irradiation.</p><p>In this study we have focused primarily upon the parotid gland. The submandibular glands contribute approximately two-thirds of unstimulated saliva volume, whereas parotid glands contribute the majority of stimulated saliva volume<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Ship1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-deAlmeida1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore Humphries et al have shown that the extent of irradiation induced apoptosis is ten-fold lower in the submandibular gland compared to the parotid gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Humphries1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. For these reason we feel that focusing our analysis upon the parotid gland is justified.</p><p>In recent years, a significant amount of attention has been focused upon understanding the molecular changes underlying the adverse effects of therapeutic radiation which negatively impact a patient's quality of life as a means for developing useful therapeutic interventions. Recent studies have suggested that gastrointestinal syndrome induced by whole body irradiation may result from radiation-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Paris1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation is contrary to previous hypotheses that gastrointestinal syndrome was caused by the failure of stem cells within the intestinal crypt to proliferate and reconstitute the crypt-villus unit. The ability of a peptide agonist to Toll-like receptor 5 (CBLB502) to preserving endothelial function in the gastrointestinal tract and prevent gastrointestinal syndrome has provided confirmatory evidence that endothelial cells likely represent one important target underlying gastrointestinal syndrome resulting from whole body irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Burdelya1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Although this study reported that CBLB502 did not affect tumor clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Burdelya1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, it is important to note that tumor response to radiation is also influenced by endothelial apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-GarciaBarros1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. These results indicate the clinical importance of preventing radiation-induced death of off-target cells in the treatment of cancer patients.</p><p>The situation in the salivary gland is somewhat analogous in that salivary gland hypofunction could result from loss of tissue stem cells that are capable of repopulating the damaged cells, damage to secretory acinar epithelial cells, loss of endothelial cells, or loss of nerve cells required for induction of secretion. Of these four possibilities, it does not appear that radiation induces changes to the blood supply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Hiramatsu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Sholley1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, or the innervation of the salivary gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Kohn1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, although it is possible that a reexamination of these points using recently generated reagents or techniques could alter this conclusion. Our results suggest that apoptosis of epithelial cells may be important in radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and the resulting diminished quality of life for head and neck cancer patients. Our results also indicate that IGF1 can be used to prevent salivary epithelial cell apoptosis and loss of glandular function, which represents a significant difference from studies on the role of endothelial cell apoptosis in gastrointestinal syndrome.</p><p>The tumor suppressor gene p53 has also been shown to be involved in the radiosensitivity of many tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Mavrakis1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, and loss of p53 function represents an important step in tumor progression. Transgenic mice expressing an inducible form of p53 have been used to evaluate radiation-induced lymphoma and these studies concluded that delaying p53 expression until after the apoptotic response had no effect on eventual tumors caused by radiation damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Christophorou1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. These results indicate that the role of p53 in apoptosis and tumor suppression are separate functions of p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Christophorou1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. We have previously demonstrated that MDM2 is a critical target of Akt in the suppression of DNA damage-induced apoptosis in salivary acinar cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Limesand2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. We observed the Akt-dependent phosphorylation of MDM2 in the salivary glands of myr-Akt1 transgenic mice which resulted in complete absence of p53 from these glands, as well as a significant decrease in two other p53 family members, p63 and p73<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Limesand2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The loss of p53 also resulted in the decreased expression of p53 target genes such a p21<sup>WAF1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Limesand2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. These results suggest that the p53 pathway is critical in regulating the radiosensitivity of the salivary glands<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Limesand2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently it has been reported that expression of p53 is required for the acute and chronic loss of salivary function following irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Avila1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Temporary suppression of radiation-induced apoptosis of salivary acinar cells could prevent inadvertent salivary gland dysfunction occurring secondary to head and neck irradiation without predisposing the salivary glands to eventual tumorigenesis.</p><p>Clearly our work highlights a first step in an effort to improve the treatment of head and neck cancer patients by preventing the initial loss of salivary function. Identification of the pathways mediating the IGF1-Akt preservation of salivary function will allow specific targeting to the salivary glands without modifying tumor therapies. Current efforts are directed towards building a preclinical model to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>Myr-Akt1 transgenic mice were generated using standard techniques as described previously by the Transgenic Mouse Core of the University of Colorado Cancer Center <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004663-Schwertfeger1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.
