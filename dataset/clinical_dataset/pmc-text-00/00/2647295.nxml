We report the design of synthetic oligonucleotides (aptamers) that are only internalized by epithelial cancer cells and can be precisely activated by light to kill such cells. Specifically, phototoxic DNA aptamers were selected to bind to unique short <italic>O</italic>-glycan-peptide signatures on the surface of breast, colon, lung, ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells. These surface antigens are not present on normal epithelial cells but are internalized and routed through endosomal and Golgi compartments by cancer cells, thus providing a focused mechanism for their intracellular delivery. When modified at their 5&#x02032; end with the photodynamic therapy agent chlorin <italic>e</italic><sub>6</sub> and delivered to epithelial cancer cells, these aptamers exhibited a remarkable enhancement (&#x0003e;500-fold increase) in toxicity upon light activation, compared to the drug alone and were not cytotoxic towards cell types lacking such <italic>O</italic>-glycan-peptide markers. Our findings suggest that these synthetic oligonucleotide aptamers can serve as delivery vehicles in precisely routing cytotoxic cargoes to and into epithelial cancer cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Oligonucleotides cannot traverse cell membranes, a feature that restricts their therapeutic potential either as modulators of intracellular cell functions or as carriers of therapeutic agents. However, short, single-stranded RNA or DNA oligonucleotides known as aptamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) have been shown to adopt distinct 3D structures complementary to a given molecular target. They are derived from an initial combinatorial pool of random oligonucleotide sequences using an <italic>in vitro</italic> selection approach termed SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). By judiciously selecting cell surface structures as targets for aptamer searches, one can derive aptamers that can specifically recognize internalized surface markers (portals) and thus be imported into cells. A case in point is the use of RNA aptamers recognizing the human prostate antigen PSMA, to deliver siRNA molecules into such cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Membrane-associated glycoforms of mucin glycoproteins represent an important class of tumor surface markers that are uniquely and abundantly expressed on a broad range of epithelial cancer cells (breast, ovary, colon, pancreas, lung and prostate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). These markers are also rapidly recycled through intracellular compartments (endosomes, Golgi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>), and thus can serve as entry portals for aptamers. Mucins typically harbour variable numbers of peptide tandem repeats (VNTR) rich in serine, threonine and proline residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) where serines and threonines are post-translationally modified with <italic>O</italic>-linked oligosaccharides (<italic>O</italic>-glycans). Carbohydrate chains account for more than 50% of their mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The aberrant glycosylation of mucins has been shown to promote a metastatic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>). Shortened carbohydrate chains and peptide epitopes are revealed as a consequence of incomplete <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation events occurring in these cells. Monoclonal antibodies raised against tumour-associated forms of MUC1 commonly recognize part of the mucin exposed peptide backbone or the Tn (GalNAc) and T (Gal&#x003b2;1-3GalNAc) antigens <italic>O</italic>-linked to the peptide tandem repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). We have recently generated a peptide corresponding to five consecutive mucin MUC1 tandem repeats (MUC1-5TR) and biosynthetically introduced GalNAc sugars (MUC1-5TR-GalNAc; Tn antigens) within its structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) with a view to deriving short, single-strand DNA aptamers displaying a more focused specificity for these tumour antigens than monoclonal antibodies. We now report that these 25-base long synthetic DNA aptamers are efficiently internalized by epithelial cancer cells and can be used as delivery vehicles to specifically route pro-drug cargoes such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) agents into such cells to kill them.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents for SELEX screens</title><p>We initially engineered mimics of known mucin MUC1 determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) on cancer cells namely a recombinant deglycosylated peptide representing five MUC1 tandem repeats (MUC1-5TR) and its <italic>O</italic>-glycosylated form containing 15 GalNAc sugars (Tn antigens, MUC1-5TR-GalNAc) to serve as targets in selecting DNA aptamers. Briefly, a synthetic gene coding for five copies of the MUC1 tandem repeat and a N-terminal hexahistidine metal affinity tag (MUC1-5TR) was inserted into the pET-15b expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting construct was used to transform competent <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen) and the expression of MUC1-5TR induced with isopropyl &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). MUC1-5TR was purified by nickel affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. The sequence of the purified MUC1-5TR was confirmed by mass spectrometry and the peptide was stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until use. MUC1-5TR was enzymatically modified with up to 15 GalNAc sugars (Tn antigen) using a recombinant secreted form of the human ppGalNAc-T1 expressed in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Unglycosylated MUC1-5TR or its Tn-labelled form (3 mg) were separately immobilized unto 1 mm HiTrap Chelating HP columns (GE Healthcare, Baie d&#x02019;Urf&#x000e9;, Qu&#x000e9;bec). The target loaded matrices were subsequently used for aptamer selection. In the case of <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine being used as a target, plates covalently modified with this sugar were purchased from EMD Biosciences (Mississauga, Ontario). Briefly, GalNac determinants were directly coupled using an amide linkage to wells of a 96-well polystyrene plate via a 16&#x02013;18 atom flexible spacer, providing a homogeneous presentation of the target to putative DNA aptamers emerging as strong ligands. Plates were kept at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for the duration of the experiment, except during ssDNA library incubation times. <italic>In vitro</italic> selection strategies based on SELEX approach were developed to identify aptamers that bind to all three targets under physiological conditions (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4, 37&#x000b0;C. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The selection of MUC1 DNA aptamer<bold>s</bold> is described in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn967/DC1">Supplementary Data section 1</ext-link> and in ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Selected aptamer pools were amplified by asymmetric PCR (aPCR) using an excess of forward primer (1000&#x000d7;) and limiting the amount of reverse primer (1&#x000d7;) to favour the production of sense (5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;) single-stranded DNA products (DNA aptamers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the selection process leading to the discovery of epithelial tumour-specific DNA aptamers.

Specifically, a pool of ssDNAs displaying a 25 nt random region was incubated with either His-tagged MUC1-5TR peptide or its GalNAc-modified variant (Tn antigen) bound to nickel-NTA beads or with <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine immobilized in wells of a 96-well plate. Bound oligonucleotides were recovered using a high salt step, desalted and amplified by asymmetric PCR before a new cycle of selection. After 10 rounds of selection, each DNA aptamer pool was cloned and sequenced. Individual aptamers were synthesized and further analysed to assess their specificity. (<bold>b</bold>) Binding specificity of DNA aptamers to their respective target. The association of 11 distinct DNA aptamers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) recognizing MUC1 peptide constructs (MUC1-5TR, Tn antigen) as well as the carbohydrate <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) with their respective target was further confirmed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Aptamers were incubated with their target for 30 min and resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide DNA retardation gel. DNA&#x02013;peptide complexes were observed when aptamers 5TR1, 5TR2, 5TR3 and 5TR4 were mixed with their target namely unglycosylated MUC1-5TR. Similarly, complexes were observed when aptamers 5TRG1, 5TRG2, 5TRG3, 5TRG4, GalNAc1, GalNAc2 and GalNAc3 were added to the peptide MUC1-5TR-GalNAc (Tn antigen). Individual DNA aptamers derived from different glycosylated targets (Tn antigen versus GalNAc alone) displayed distinct band shifts with the MUC1-5TR-GalNAc peptide (Tn antigen). The higher mass species observed for all GalNAc-specific aptamers bound to glycosylated MUC1 (MUC1-5TR-GalNAc) reflect the higher molar ratio of bound aptamers (GalNAc1, GalNAc2 and GalNAc3) recognizing up to 15 GalNAc groups per MUC1-5TR-GalNAc peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) while aptamers recognizing features from both peptide and sugar components (5TRG1, 5TRG2, 5TRG3, 5TRG4) yielded distinct band migration profiles.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn967f1"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>List of nucleotide sequences defining the specificity of each DNA aptamer</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkn967i1.jpg"/></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>All subsequent oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co (Midland, Texas, USA) either as unmodified aptamers or labelled at their 5&#x02032; amino end with biotin, chlorin <italic>e</italic><sub>6</sub> or Rhodamine101.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)</title><p>The association of DNA aptamers recognizing MUC1 peptide constructs with their respective target was confirmed by a shift in their electrophoretic mobility in a 6% polyacrylamide pre-cast DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada) upon complexation with their target.

Cells were also stained with the mAb <italic>Onc</italic>M27 (recognizes the mucin MUC1 tandem repeat; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn967/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>) to confirm the expression of MUC1 determinants on cancer cells. (<bold>b</bold>) Specific staining of MUC1 and Tn antigen tumour markers on cancer cells as monitored by confocal microscopy. MCF-7, T47D, PANC-1 and CHO (negative control) cells were stained with three representative rhodamine-labelled MUC1 aptamers (red), namely 5TR1 binding to the unglycosylated MUC1 tandem repeat core, 5TRG2 recognizing peptide-GalNAc (Tn antigen) determinants and the aptamer GalNAc3 staining terminal GalNAc groups. Confocal images of viable cells recorded at 37&#x000b0;C were taken 30 min post incubation. Composite images were created to reveal the routing of rhodamine-aptamers to endosomal and lysosomal compartments (Lysotracker-stained (green) organelles). As a control, cells were also stained with the mAb <italic>Onc</italic>M27 (recognizes the mucin MUC1 tandem repeat; Figure S1) and confocal images recorded to confirm the internalization of MUC1 and Tn antigen markers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn967f2"/></fig><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Kinetic parameters and calculated Kd values for DNA aptamers</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aptamer</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">SELEX target</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>k</italic><sub>a</sub> (M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF1"><sup>a</sup></xref></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>k</italic><sub>d</sub> (s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF1"><sup>a</sup></xref></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> (nM)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5TR1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MUC1-5TR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.22 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0026</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5TR2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MUC1-5TR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.48 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.01268</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">85.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5TR3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MUC1-5TR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.43 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.00358</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">83.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5TR4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MUC1-5TR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.45 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.00311</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5TRG1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tn antigen</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.33 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.00398</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5TRG2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tn antigen</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.02 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0186</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5TRG3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tn antigen</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.92 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.00252</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5TRG4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tn antigen</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.91 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.00314</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">34.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GalNAc1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>N</italic>-Acetylgalactosamine</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.33 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0801</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GalNAc2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>N</italic>-Acetylgalactosamine</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.02 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.1199</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GalNAc3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>N</italic>-Acetylgalactosamine</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.21 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.00098</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">47.3</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TF1"><p><sup>a</sup>&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> &#x0003e; 0.981.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec><title>Aptamers as selective delivery vehicles into epithelial cancer cells</title><p>The anionic character of oligonucleotides does not favour their spontaneous entry into cells. However, epithelial cells recycle underglycosylated forms of mucin MUC1 from their surface to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network to further modify their glycan structure. MUC1 has been shown to be recycled through endosomal/lysosomal and the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network from the apical surface several times, a process that is accompanied by further sialylation of the <italic>O</italic>-glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). To determine if our aptamers could be transported into cells by virtue of their association with MUC1 targets, we measured the time-dependent cellular uptake of rhodamine-labelled aptamers 5TR1, 5TRG2 and GalNAc3 by flow cytometry at 4&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C as well as in the presence of monodansyl cadaverine, an inhibitor of coated pit formation and receptor-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25">23&#x02013;25</xref>). As predicted, the aptamers 5TR1, 5TRG2 and GalNAc3 were rapidly endocytosed by MUC1<sup>+</sup> cells at 37&#x000b0;C but not at 4&#x000b0;C or by MUC1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Their cellular uptake was significantly inhibited by monodansylcadaverine suggesting that their entry into MUC1<sup>+</sup> cells occurred by receptor-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). A control irrelevant aptamer did not enter either MUC1<sup>+</sup> or MUC1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>d). Thus, the evaluated DNA aptamers remained membrane-impermeant unless they were able to associate with an internalized surface marker. In terms of cellular localization, confocal microscopy images indicate that internalized DNA aptamers migrate through endosomal, lysosomal as well as through Golgi compartments and potentially to the cytosol of epithelial cancer cells but not to the ER lumen or nucleus of MUC1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).<fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Time-dependent internalization of rhodamine-labelled aptamers into MCF-7, T47D, PANC-1 and CHO cells as measured by flow cytometry.

Their effectiveness as therapeutic agents is dependent on their cellular delivery. Since, aptamers 5TR1, 5TRG2 and GalNAc3 are selectively delivered into epithelial cancer cells, we introduced at their 5&#x02032; end, the heme-like PDT agent chlorin <italic>e</italic><sub>6</sub> (Ce6). Our aim was to demonstrate that, by virtue of their guided cellular targeting and intracellular routing, PDT-aptamers can target and kill MUC1 presenting cancer cells at much lower doses of chlorin <italic>e</italic><sub>6</sub> than the free drug itself. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, chlorin <italic>e</italic><sub>6</sub>-aptamers directed at eight MUC1<sup>+</sup> epithelial cancer cell lines (T47D, MCF-7, PANC-1, BxPC3, A549, MGH13, OVCAR-3, HT-29) were &#x0003e;500 times more toxic (on a molar basis) upon light activation than the free drug chlorin <italic>e</italic><sub>6</sub>. More importantly, these same aptamers were not toxic towards MUC<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (CHO cells, U87MG cells) or MUC1<sup>+</sup> normal human primary mammary epithelial cells displaying fully glycosylated MUC1 mucin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Finally, DNA aptamers lacking the chlorin <italic>e</italic><sub>6</sub> group or a chlorin <italic>e</italic><sub>6</sub>-aptamer harbouring an irrelevant nucleotide sequence were not able to kill either MUC1<sup>+</sup> or MUC1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The dramatic enhancement in cellular toxicity with chlorin <italic>e</italic><sub>6</sub>-aptamers upon light treatment can be rationalized by the production and rapid cellular re-distribution of toxic singlet oxygen species throughout cancer cells (oxidative burst). This phenomenon was visualized in cells as the result of capturing the emission of light by chloromethyl-2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate/AcrO upon reaction with the generated <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a).<fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>DNA aptamers labelled with the photodynamic agent chlorin <italic>e</italic><sub>6</sub> selectively kill epithelial cancer cells.

These important parameters must be addressed in devising targeted cancer therapies that can home on cancer cells while sparing normal tissues. We present evidence that internalized surface markers such as underglycosylated mucin MUC1 antigens can act as highly selective portals in importing oligonucleotides such as DNA aptamers into a broad range of epithelial cancer cells (breast, ovary, prostate, pancreas, colon and lung). When aptamers directed at the MUC1 peptide or its related Tn antigens were armed to carry a cytotoxic cargo such as the light-activated PDT drug, chlorin <italic>e</italic><sub>6</sub>, their ability to kill epithelial cells was enhanced by several orders of magnitude upon light exposure in comparison to the free drug alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). This phenomenom was demonstrated for eight human MUC1<sup>+</sup> cancer cell lines (T47D, MCF-7, PANC-1, BxPC3, A549, MGH13, OVCAR-3, HT-29) representing five classes of epithelial cancer cells (breast, pancreas, lung, ovaries, colon). More importantly, the inability of anionic oligonucleotides to spontaneously enter cells resulted in no observable non-specific toxicity towards MUC1<bold><sup>&#x02212;</sup></bold> cells (CHO, U87MG) or even to MUC1<sup>+</sup> normal human primary mammary epithelial cells displaying fully glycosylated MUC1 mucins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Our findings suggest that known cytotoxic drugs, prodrugs as well as oligonucleotide-based cargoes such as siRNAs, PNAs, ribozymes or antisense oligonucleotides could be coupled to deglycosylated mucin- and Tn antigen-directed aptamers in order to target and deliver them to a broad range of epithelial cancers. The recent design of chimeras involving RNA aptamers against the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) linked to siRNAs, supports our claim that aptamers can be used as directed delivery agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, siRNAs do require a very precise delivery since they are known to non-specifically activate toll-like receptors leading to interferon production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In addition and as in the case of other cytotoxic agents, siRNAs may potentially kill non-targeted cell types if their cellular action triggers apoptotic mechanisms, a challenge that further emphasize the need for a focused delivery strategy. For this reason, we have employed a prodrug strategy illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>b, where the PDT agent chlorin <italic>e</italic><sub>6</sub> is coupled to DNA aptamers, delivered into targeted cancer cells and activated by light to generate damaging singlet oxygen species and cell death.</p><p>Mechanistically, DNA aptamers directed at the MUC1 tandem repeat or its Tn antigen were rapidly internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), a result that correlates with Hughey and her coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) who showed that underglycosylated MUC1 mucins are recycled by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and trafficked through vesicular compartments including lysosomes. Our data suggest that such aptamers are routed through endosomal, lysosomal and Golgi compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) but not to the nucleus of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Singlet oxygen species however do diffuse to all cellular locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a) implying that aptamer delivery to the nucleus or cytosol is not a necessary prerequisite for efficient toxicity to occur. One requirement may thus be that the toxic agent (either singlet oxygen, radiation or a diffusible drug) be able to relocate across cellular compartments.</p><p>Monoclonal antibodies to the extracellular portion of the MUC1 peptide domain and its Tn antigen are currently being evaluated as potential imaging and therapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). However, aptamers represent smaller, simpler, non-antigenic alternatives to antibodies and as presented in this study, display remarkably high specificity and affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>'s in the nanomolar range) for unique GalNAc-peptide structures specifically found on epithelial cancer cells. These findings suggest that the bivalent or multivalent nature of antibodies and lectins typically needed to recognize carbohydrate determinants are not required for DNA aptamers targeting GalNAc-containing mucin markers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). In addition, methods to chemically stabilize and alter the pharmacokinetics of aptamers have already led to the FDA approval of Macugen, a pegylated RNA aptamer directed at the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy and shown to help reduce the risk of vision loss in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>Finally, PDT is a safe, non-radioactive treatment modality that is well suited to treating a broad range of topical and luminal tissues using endoscopic light sources (via interstitial, bronchoscopic, colonoscopic or intraperitoneal procedures). Applications of PDT for treating patients with breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and oesophageal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) cancers are now well documented. Nevertheless, there is a strong need to specifically deliver sensitizers to diseased cells in order to minimize damage caused to healthy tissues upon illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The phototoxic aptamers described in this study would directly address the issue of PDT toxicity to normal tissues since malignant cells derived from such tissues typically express unique mucin and Tn antigen surface signatures, and would thus represent the only target of such PDT aptamers.</p><p>In summary, highly expressed and aberrantly glycosylated MUC1 determinants are found in greater than 90% of all primary and metastatic breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) as well as most epithelial carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). This study highlights that targeting small phototoxic DNA aptamers to underglycosylated determinants of MUC1 offers great potential in directing therapeutic agents to and into a broad range of epithelial cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This study has been supported by a grant from the Canadian Breast Cancer Research Alliance in association with the Canadian Cancer Society (to J.G.).
