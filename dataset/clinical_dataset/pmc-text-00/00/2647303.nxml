Here we report a modified AMO approach in which multiple antisense units are engineered into a single unit that is able to simultaneously silence multiple-target miRNAs, the multiple-target AMO or MTg-AMO. We validated the technique with two separate MTg-AMOs: anti-<italic>miR-21</italic>/anti-<italic>miR-155</italic>/anti-<italic>miR-17-5p</italic> and anti-<italic>miR-1</italic>/anti-<italic>miR-133</italic>. We first verified the ability of the MTg-AMOs to antagonize the repressive actions of their target miRNAs using luciferase reporter activity assays and to specifically knock down the levels of their target miRNAs using real-time RT-PCR methods. We then used the MTg-AMO approach to identify several tumor suppressors&#x02014;TGFBI, APC and BCL2L11 as the target genes for oncogenic <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic>, respectively, and two cardiac ion channel genes <italic>HCN2</italic> (encoding a subunit of cardiac pacemaker channel) and <italic>CACNA1C</italic> (encoding the &#x003b1;-subunit of cardiac L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel) for the muscle-specific <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic>. We further demonstrated that the MTg-AMO targeting <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic> produced a greater inhibitory effect on cancer cell growth, compared with the regular single-target AMOs. Moreover, while using the regular single-target AMOs excluded HCN2 as a target gene for either <italic>miR-1</italic> or <italic>miR-133</italic>, the MTg-AMO approach is able to reveal HCN2 as the target for both <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic>. Our findings suggest the MTg-AMO as an improved approach for miRNA target finding and for studying function of miRNAs. This approach may find its broad application for exploring biological processes involving multiple miRNAs and multiple genes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Discovery of microRNA-1 (miRNA) has revolutionarily advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). MiRNAs are a large, ubiquitous class of endogenous noncoding regulatory mRNAs of &#x0223c;22-nt long that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of numerous eukaryotic genes. These molecules act by binding to their target mRNAs, preferentially to the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) by a partial base-paring mechanism. In order for a miRNA to give rise of functional consequences, its 5&#x02032;-end 7&#x02013;8 nt must have exact complementarity to the target mRNA, the so-called &#x02018;seed&#x02019; region, and partial complementarity with rest of the sequence. The current model for inhibition of expression by miRNA suggests that a miRNA either inhibits translation or induces degradation of its target mRNA, depending upon the overall degree of complementarity of the binding site, number of binding sites and the accessibility of the bindings sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>). MiRNAs have been increasingly implicated in the control of various biological processes, including cell differentiation, cell proliferation, development and apoptosis, and many pathological processes such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>). Recent evidence has suggested that miRNAs might be viable therapeutic targets for a wide range of human disease including cancers and cardiovascular disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>One of the indispensable approaches in miRNA research as well as in miRNA therapy is inhibition or loss-of-function of miRNAs. The base-pair interaction between miRNAs and mRNAs is essential for the function of miRNAs; therefore, a logical approach of silencing miRNAs is to use a nucleic acid that is antisense to the miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">11&#x02013;15</xref>). These anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs) specifically and stoichiometrically bind, and efficiently and irreversibly silence their target miRNAs. The AMO approach has been used in numerous studies to identify many cellular functions of miRNAs and has been considered a plausible strategy for miRNA therapy of human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">11&#x02013;15</xref>).</p><p>However, it has become clear that a particular condition may be associated with multiple miRNAs and a given gene may be regulated by multiple miRNAs. For example, a study directed to the human heart identified 67 significantly upregulated miRNAs and 43 significantly downregulated miRNAs in failing left ventricles versus normal hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). No less than five different miRNAs have been shown to critically involve in cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19 B20 B21">17&#x02013;21</xref>). Similarly, Volinia <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) conducted a large-scale miRNA analysis on 540 solid tumor samples including lung, breast, stomach, prostate, colon and pancreatic tumors. Their survey revealed 15 miRNAs upregulated and 12 downregulated in human breast cancer tissues. Similar changes of multiple miRNAs were also found in other five solid tumor types. Many of these miRNAs have been reported to regulate cell proliferation or apoptosis and some of them have been considered oncogenic miRNAs or tumor suppressor miRNAs. These properties of miRNA regulation may well create some uncertainties of outcomes by applying the AMO technology to silence miRNAs since knocking down a single miRNA may not be sufficient, and certainly not optimal, to achieve the expected interference of cellular process and gene expression which are regulated by multiple miRNAs. These facts also prompted us to raise several pertinent questions. If targeting a single miRNA is adequate for tackling a pertinent pathological condition? If simultaneously targeting multiple miRNAs relevant to a particular condition offers an improved approach than targeting a single miRNA using the regular AMO techniques? How can we concomitantly silence multiple miRNAs to achieve an interference of a cellular function? To answer these questions, we developed an innovative strategy, the multiple-target AMO technology, which confers a single AMO fragment the capability of targeting multiple miRNAs. We functionally validated the technology with oncogenic miRNAs <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-15</italic>5 and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic>, and the muscle-specific miRNAs <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic>, by demonstrating the superiority of MTg-AMOs over the regular AMOs in miRNA targeting. Using this new technology, we were also able to identify several new target genes for these miRNAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Neonatal rat cardiomyocyte culture</title><p>The procedures were essentially the same as previous described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).

We choose <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic>, and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic> as the miRNA targets for testing our approach since they are proven oncogenic miRNAs overexpressing in several solid cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). We then generated another AMO, which was engineered to contain the three regular AMO units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A)that could presumably target all the three miRNAs. For convenience, we named this longer AMO multiple-target AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> or MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub>. In addition, a negative control MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) was also constructed as a negative control for the effects of MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub>.</p><p>We went on to test the ability of these MTg-AMOs to inactivate their respective target miRNAs by luciferase reporter assays. An artificially designed fragment containing the binding sequences for all five target miRNAs (<italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic>, <italic>miR-17-5p</italic>, <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic>) was inserted into the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the luciferase gene in the luciferase reporter vector (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1053/DC1">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link> online). Luciferase activities were measured 48 h after transfection of the vector together with various constructs (as specified) into the HEK293 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> (10 nM) was able to abolish the inhibitory effect on luciferase activity, induced by any of <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic> alone (10 nM) or any combinations of the three miRNAs at 10 nM each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C&#x02013;E), while the negative control MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> (10 nM) failed to produce any effects. By comparison, the regular AMO targeting a single miRNA affected the luciferase activity only when co-transfected with its target miRNA. Also striking is that MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> produced significantly greater repressive effects than the mixture of the regular AMOs AMO-21, AMO-155 and AMO-17 at 10 nM each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), which is labeled &#x02018;AMO-Mix&#x02019; in the figures. The negative control MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> did not produce any significant effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C&#x02013;E). To examine whether the AMOs could also exert silencing effects on endogenous miRNAs in HeLa cervial carcinoma cells, we first confirmed the presence of mature <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic> in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F), and then we looked at the luciferase activities after co-transfection of the vector and MTg-AMO21/155/17, AMO-21, AMO-155 or AMO-17. As expected, these AMOs all were able to significantly increase luciferase activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G), presumably by knocking down the endogenous <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic> in HeLa cells.</p><p>In order to investigate whether the enhanced effects of MTg-AMO could be reproduced on other target miRNAs, we designed another MTg-AMO fragment targeting <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), the muscle-specific miRNAs crucial to myogenesis and cardiac hypertrophy and ischemic arrhythmogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22">19&#x02013;22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Here we called this fragment MTg-AMO<sub>1/133</sub>. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C, MTg-AMO<sub>1/133</sub> (10 nM) antagonized the repressive actions produced by either <italic>miR-1</italic> or <italic>miR-133</italic> (10 nM) in luciferase assays. MTg-AMO<sub>1/133</sub> also reversed the inhibitory effects elicited by co-application of <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic>, with a greater potency than the mixture of AMO-1 and AMO-133 (10 nM each, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). We then went on to verify the ability of MTg-AMO1/133, AMO-1 and AMO-133 to inhibit the repressing effects induced by endogenous <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic> in H9c2 rat ventricular cells. We first demonstrated the presence of <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic> in H9c2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D), and then we observed the luciferase activities after co-transfection of the vector and MTg-AMO1/133, AMO-1 and AMO-133. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E, these AMOs applied alone each significantly enhanced luciferase activities.</p><p>To verify the luciferase results and to search the target genes of the five miRNAs using our MTg-AMO strategy, we first performed computational prediction using the miRBase hosted by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. We identified three tumor suppressor genes&#x02014;TGFBI, APC and BCL2L11 as potential targets for <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic>, respectively, which carry in their 3&#x02032;-UTRs the binding sites for the three miRNAs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1053/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link> online). We then evaluated the effects of MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> on the protein levels of these three candidate target genes. As depicted in the left and middle panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> (10 nM) concordantly increased the levels of tumor suppressor genes TGFBI, APC and BCL2L11 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells which express abundant endogenous <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1053/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link> online).

Notably, neither AMO-1 nor AMO-133 alone produced significant effects on the protein level of HCN2, indicating that use of the regular AMOs can yield false-negative results when a gene is simultaneously regulated by more than one miRNA. Co-transfection of AMO-1 and AMO-133 (AMO-Mix) also increased the HCN2 protein levels, but to a significantly less extent compared to MTg-AMO<sub>1/133</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><p>To verify that TGFBI, APC and BCL2L11 are indeed the cognate targets for <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic>, and HCN2 and CACNA1C the cognate targets for <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic>, respectively, we inserted the 3&#x02032;-UTRs or fragments within the 3&#x02032;-UTRs containing the predicted miRNA-binding sites of the genes into the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the luciferase reporter vector.

Consistent with previous studies showing degradation of target miRNAs by AMOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), we found that these MTg-AMOs remarkably reduced their target miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), and so did the regular AMOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Noticeably, the MTg-AMOs and the regular AMOs used in our study did not show cross-reactions with nontarget miRNAs. For example, MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> only reduced <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic> levels without altering <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic> levels, detected by real-time RT-PCR; <italic>vice versa</italic>, MTg-AMO<sub>1/133</sub> reduced only <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic> levels without altering <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic> levels, indicating the specificities of actions of the MTg-AMOs.</p><p>It has recently been noticed that reduction of miRNA level by AMO could be simply due to the interference of AMO with miRNA detection when using northern blot with DNA probes, but not due to miRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). To see whether the miRNA reduction detected by real-time RT-PCR in our experiments was also ascribed to the same mechanism, we carried out another study following the procedure described by Fabani and Gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). We spiked MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> into lysate from control untreated HeLa cells at a series of concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 nM before RNA purification involving denaturing conditions, and then measured the levels of <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic> with the isolated RNA sample. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E, AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> produced concentration-dependent reduction of the levels, indicating that the miRNAs in the AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub>:miRNA complex were not directed into the RNA fraction during purification. Similar results were obtained with MTg-AMO<sub>1/133</sub> on <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic> in lysate from control untreated H9c2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F). Hence, the apparent reduction of miRNA levels revealed by qRT-PCR should not be used as evidence of a miRNA degradation pathway, but merely indicating the binding of the MTg-AMOs to the targeted miRNAs leading to inhibition of miRNA activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>MTg-AMO enhances the efficacy to suppresses cancer cell growth</title><p>Since MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> was designed to target the three most frequently overexpressed oncogenic miRNAs in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), it was expected to suppress cancer cell growth. To this end, we investigated the effects of MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> on viability of MCF-7 cells. MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> (10 nM) diminished the survival rate to &#x0223c;18% of the values from control group or negative control MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> group, whereas in order to reach significant effects with the regular AMOs, the concentration of each AMO had to be elevated to 100 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Most noticeably, co-transfection of AMO-21, AMO-155 and AMO-17 at 10 nM each (a total of 30 nM, AMO-Mix1) or 3.3 nM each (a total of 10 nM, AMO-Mix2) produced significantly smaller decreases in cell survival than 10 nM MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D).</p><p>In summary, using the MTg-AMO approach, we have been able to identify several tumor suppressors as the target genes for oncogenic <italic>miR-21</italic>, <italic>miR-155</italic> and <italic>miR-17-5p</italic> and two cardiac ion channel genes for the muscle-specific <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic>. This study also represents the first to reveal the cardiac L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel &#x003b1;-subunit gene <italic>CACNA1C</italic> gene as a target gene for <italic>miR-133</italic> action.</p><p>The improvement of the MTg-AMO approach over the regular single-target AMO approach is reflected by two findings. First, MTg-AMO<sub>21/155/17</sub> demonstrated a strengthened ability to inhibit cancer cell growth compared with the single-target AMOs or combination of these AMOs. Second, the MTg-AMO approach is able to reveal <italic>HCN2</italic> gene as a target for <italic>miR-1</italic> and <italic>miR-133</italic>, which is otherwise concealed by the single-target AMO approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). There are two possible explanations for the superiority of the MTg-AMO approach over the regular AMO approach. First, the covalent linkage ensures co-delivery of different AMOs. Given the comparable cell targeting rates for the MTg-AMO and the individual AMOs, only the MTg-AMO approach ensures that the transfected cells received all relevant miRNA antagonists for gene targeting and proliferation inhibition. Another possible explanation is that annealing rate constants describing the annealing reaction between complementary nucleic acids strongly correlate with the length of the two complementary sequences. On the average, longer sequences anneal faster than shorter sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Therefore, the MTg-AMO might anneal faster with the miRNAs compared to the smaller individual AMO. Future studies are needed to verify these notions.</p><p>The beauty of this MTg-AMO &#x02018;single-agent, multiple-targets&#x02019; strategy is that it can be either homogeneous carrying multiple identical antisense units targeting a specific miRNA to enhance the antagonizing effect or heterogeneous with multiple distinct antisense units targeting different miRNAs to expand targeting capacity. Considering that a given mRNA is regulated by multiple miRNAs and concordantly targeting multiple miRNAs might be required to achieve optimal interference of that gene, the MTg-AMO approach may be superior to the regular AMO technique. Just taking cancer therapy as an example, an MTg-AMO can be designed to target the miRNAs that are involved in tumor cell proliferation, cell death, metastasis and vascular angiogenesis. Targeting any one of these aspects may not be optimal for controlling tumorigenesis and progression. Interfering concomitantly with all these processes should expectedly yield a better anticancer outcome. Our findings therefore suggest the MTg-AMO approach as a useful tool in miRNA target finding and the potential of this novel strategy as a miRNA therapy for cancer and cardiac disorders.</p><p>We consider the present work still preliminary; to completely validate the MTg-AMO technology as a gene therapy strategy, many important issues are to be unresolved. Future studies are warranted to test more MTg-AMOs for the advantages of this approach and to get insight into more detailed mechanisms for the actions of MTg-AMOs. Dose&#x02013;response actions were not evaluated in this study due to the difficulties of optimizing the ratio of construct/lipofectamine to ensure efficient transfection. The optimal combination of targets for an MTg-AMO remains unknown. In this study, we tested &#x02018;two-in-one&#x02019; and &#x02018;three-in-one&#x02019; MTg-AMOs. In theory, &#x02018;<italic>N</italic>-in-one&#x02019; MTg-AMOs (<italic>N</italic> could be any number of AMO units) can be designed to include more relevant AMOs. More rigorous studies are warranted to define the optimal combination of length of MTg-AMOs to optimize desired effectiveness.
