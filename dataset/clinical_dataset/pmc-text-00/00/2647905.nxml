Cartier's second voyage (1535&#x02013;1536) was undertaken at the command of King Fran&#x000e7;ois 1<sup>er </sup>to complete the discovery of the western lands under the same climate and parallels as in France. At Stadaconna, now Quebec City, Cartier's crew was cured from scurvy by ascorbic acid (vitamin C) obtained as a decoction from the Iroquois. It was prepared by boiling winter leaves and the bark from an evergreen tree. The tree, identified as "Annedda", became known as the "tree of life" or "arbre de vie" because of its remarkable curative effects. In the winter, scurvy was the most prevalent disease among the Iroquois. This was due to the lack of food and vitamin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The cure for scurvy was significant for future naval explorations and for the introduction of the tree into France during the Reformation when the Age of Reason began (1558&#x02013;1648) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The medicinal value of the tree of life contributed to the resurrection of botany, which at that time struggled to free itself from pharmacy when medical men were still its masters. By the eighteenth century, the French naturalists at the Jardin du Roi in Paris knew of <italic>Thuja occidentalis </italic>as the tree of life and planted an avenue of it in the Jardin itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The Iroquois referred to the tree as Annedda (l'Annedda, Aneda, Anneda, Hanneda) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Other tribal names for conifers were "ohnehta" for white pine, "onita" and "onnetta" for white spruce (Mohawk, Onandaga). These names represent the evergreen nature characteristic of coniferous trees. Regarding the transmission of the tree of life to France, the earlier one goes, the sparser are the available manuscripts. The pre-Linnaeus terminology for conifers made their precise identity impossible to make. Based on collections by French explorers and the ethnomedicine of indigenous peoples in eastern Canada, the true identity of the tree of life became controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The identity of Anneda was narrowed down to eastern white cedar or arborvitae <italic>(Thuja occidentalis </italic>L.<italic>)</italic>, white spruce <italic>(Picea glauca </italic>(Moench) Voss), black spruce <italic>(Picea mariana (Mill.))</italic>, eastern white pine (<italic>Pinus strobus </italic>L.), red pine (<italic>Pinus resinosa </italic>Aiton), balsam fir (<italic>Abies balsamea </italic>(L.) Mill.), eastern hemlock (<italic>Tsuga canadensis </italic>(L.)), and juniper (<italic>Juniperus communis </italic>L.<italic>) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>We now know that during late a severe winter and at a similar latitude to Quebec City, the candidate trees of life are a rich nutritional source of arginine, proline and other amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Their physiological fluids and proteins contain amino acids which are essential in the human diet because the body does not synthesize them (<italic>viz</italic>., phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan, isoleucine, methionine, leucine, and lysine). Arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, histidine, proline, serine and tyrosine are conditionally essential, meaning they are not normally required in the diet, but must be supplied to specific populations that do not synthesize these amino acids in adequate amounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Today, these amino acids are used as nutritional support for the recovery of critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the recovery from scurvy they would help to promote vitamin C-dependent collagen biosynthesis, promote wound healing, reduce susceptibility to sepsis, and contribute to weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The importance of arginine as a source of the free radical nitric oxide (NO) was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998 given to R. Furchgott, J. Ignarro and F. Murad. They identified NO as a signalling molecule in the cardiovascular system. Derived from arginine and oxygen, NO maintains blood pressure by dilating blood vessels, helps kill invaders in the immune response, and is needed for wound repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It can pass through biological membranes, oxidize foreign substances, and acts as a secondary biological messenger which affects diverse metabolic pathways. Unexpectedly, the candidate trees of life can produce NO from arginine, and contain guanidino compounds that may regulate the enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which is responsible for the formation of NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The arginine-derived guanidino compounds are potential therapeutic agents for the regulation of various nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) when the overproduction of NO becomes associated with septic shock, neurodegeneration, and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>My review deals with the nitrogenous compounds in the physiological fluids of candidate trees of life in a severe winter, and theorizes as to how these nutrients could have helped to improve the recovery of the critically ill sailors in 1536. The availability of arginine, the essential amino acids, and biofactors in decoctions, obtained from the trees of life, are discussed in terms of their contributions to the recovery of the critically ill crew at Stadaconna, the ethnnobotany and ethnomedicine of the indigenous peoples in eastern Canada during food shortages, and in the vitamin C-dependent cure for scurvy. This is meant to generate hypotheses, not to confirm them.</p><sec><title>The recovery from scurvy in Jacques Cartier's crew in 1536</title><p>Scurvy is an acute chronic illness caused by a dietary deficiency of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Humans are not able to synthesize vitamin C from glucose because they lack a gluconolactone oxidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. There are two active forms of vitamin C: L-ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid is absorbed by the small intestine and requires an energy-dependent active transport system. It is stored in all tissues. Exposure to long periods of cold temperatures can lead to ascorbic-acid insufficiency.</p><p>The first symptoms of scurvy occur when the total-body pool of vitamin C falls below five grams. The body requires vitamin C to efficiently use carbohydrates, fats, and protein. It binds and neutralizes the tissue-damaging effects of free radicals. It is an essential cofactor for the formation of collagen, the body's major building protein, and is essential to the proper functioning of all internal organs.</p><p>Scurvy is characterized principally by anemia, hemorrhagic manifestations in the skin (ecchymoses and perifollicular haemorrhage), and in the musculoskeletal system (haemorrhage into periosteum and muscles). The gums start to bleed. Teeth are loosened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. With no vitamin C intake, the symptoms of scurvy would occur after one to three months. Unless treated, scurvy is fatal.</p><p>At Stadaconna (46&#x000b0; 49' N, 71&#x000b0; 13' N) and in November1535, Canada's cold struck with its entire rigor, and ice thickened to two fathoms. In December, over 50 of the Iroquois died from an unknown sickness (scurvy). The sickness began to spread to Cartier's crews in all three of his ships. By mid-February 1536, of the 110 member crews, 8 were already dead and more than 50 past all hope of recovery. Excerpts from Burrage [1, p. 73] reveal that the unknown sickness in Cartier's crew "<italic>spread itselfe amongst us after the strangest sort that ever was eyther heard of or seene, insomuch as some did lose all their strength, and could not stand on their feete, then did their legges swel, their sinnowes shrinke as blacke as any cole. Others also had all their skins spotted with spots of blood of a purple colour: then did it ascend up to their ankels, knees, thighes, shoulders, armes and necke: their mouth became stincking, their gummes so rotten, that all the flesh did fall off, even to the rootes of teeth, which did also almost fall out</italic>".</p><p><italic>"Our Captaine seeing this our misery, and that the sicknesse was gone to farre, ordained and commanded, that every one should devoutly prepare himselfe to prayer, and in remembrance of Christ, caused his Image to be set upon a tree, about a flight shot from the fort amidst the yce and snow, giving all men to understand, that on the Sunday following, service should be said there, and that whosoever could goe, sicke or whole, should go thither in Procession, singing the seven Psalmes of David, with other Letanies, praying most heartily that it would please the said our Christ to have compassion upon us ... That day Philip Rougemont...being 22 yeeres olde, and because the sicknesse was to us unknown, our Captaine caused him to be ripped to see if by any meanes possible we might know what it was...he was found to have his heart white, but rotten, and more than a quart of red water about it: his liver was indifferent faire, but his lungs blacke and mortified, his blood was altogither shrunke about the heart, so that when he was opened great quantitie of rotten blood issued out from about his heart...Moreover, because one of his thighs was very blacke without, it was opened, but within it was whole and sound." </italic>Scurvy continued to spread until not more than three sound men remained in the ships. None were able to go under the hatches to "<italic>draw drink for himselfe, nor for his fellowes</italic>."</p><p>At Stadaconna, Cartier encountered the native Domagaia, who <italic>"not passing ten or twelve dayes afore, had bene very sike with that disease, and had his knees swolne as bigge as a childe of two yeres old, all his sinews shrunke together, his teeth spoyled, his gummes rotten, and stinking. Our Captaine seeing him whole and sound, was therat marvelous glad, hoping to understand and know of him how he had healed himselfe...He answered, that he had taken the juice and sappe of the leaves of a certain Tree, and therewith had healed himselfe: For it is a singular remedy against that disease."</italic></p><p>Domagaia "<italic>sent two women to fetch some of it, which brought ten or twelve branches of it, and therewithall shewed the way how to use it... to take the barke and leaves of the sayd tree, and boile them togither, then to drinke of the sayd decoction every other day, and to put the dregs of it upon his legs that is sicke: moreover, they told us, that the vertue of that tree was, to heale any other disease: the tree in their language called Ameda or Hanneda...</italic>" Other translations refer to the tree as "<italic>Annedda</italic>", "<italic>Anneda</italic>" or "<italic>Hanneda</italic>" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This sickness was treated with a boiled decoction from the bark and leaves of "<italic>a tree as big as any oak in France</italic>".</p><p>Cook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] translates that "<italic>The Captain at once ordered a drink to be prepared for the sick men but none of them would taste it. At length one or two thought they would risk a trial. As soon as they had drunk it they felt better, which must clearly be ascribed to miraculous causes; for after drinking it two or three times they recovered health and strength and were cured of all the diseases they had ever had. And some of the sailors who had been suffering for five or six years from the French pox [syphilis] were by this medicine cured completely. When this became known, there was such a press for the medicine that they almost killed each other to have it first; so that in less than eight days a whole tree as large and as tall as any I ever saw was used up, and produced such a result that had all the doctors of Louvain and Montpellier been there, with all the drugs of Alexandria, they could not have done so much in a year as did this tree in eight days; for it benefitted us so much that all who were willing to use it recovered health and strength, thanks be to God</italic>." We do not know how much ascorbic acid was lost during the boiling of the decoction and in the recovery of the "dregs", but it is clear that sufficient vitamin C was available to initiate a cure.</p><p>In today's healthy men, the body is estimated to store 1,500 mg of ascorbic acid. It is used at an average rate of 3% of the existing pool per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. After three months of vitamin C deprivation, the stores become largely depleted. The earliest signs of depletion begin during the first month of deprivation. Bleeding gums are not the most characteristic feature of scurvy and are a late manifestation. Except in the most severe cases, vitamin C would stop spontaneous bleeding within 24 hours and bleeding of the gums would stop in two to three days. Muscle and bone pain would quickly fade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In advanced scurvy another group of symptoms becomes identifiable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. They include ocular haemorrhages, loss of secretion of salivary and lachrymal glands, swelling of the parotid and submaxillary glands, loss of hair, femoral neuropathy, oliguria with edema of the lower extremities, psychological disturbances, impaired vascular activity, poor responses to stimuli that normally activate vasomotor adaptive mechanisms, and scorbutic arthritis, which is clinically similar to rheumatoid arthritis with pain, swelling, joint effusions, and limited motion. All of the above would respond completely to therapy with ascorbic acid given the added nutritional benefits of the conditionally and essential amino acids and other biofactors in the decoction.</p></sec><sec><title>Identities of Annedda and the trees of life</title><p>Before 1547 and during the reign of Fran&#x000e7;ois 1<sup>er</sup>, seeds of Annedda were delivered to the Royal Garden (Jardin du Roi) at Fontainbleau and presented to the King. Apparently seeds were collected from a tree or trees similar to Annedda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In 1553, Belon wrote in the Bulletin Dendrologique that Annedda was growing in the Royal Gardens at Fontainbleau. Nearby was another small tree, a five-needled pine, referred to as the second tree of life. Wood from these trees were used as medicine.</p><p>In Hickel's translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] of Belon's book, we read that "<italic>...&#x000e0; cette &#x000e9;poque, les seules esp&#x000e8;ces exotiques introduites &#x000e9;taient l'Arborvitae (Thuya occidentalis) et Pinus strobus, et que, d'autre part l'auteur confond plus ou moins diverses esp&#x000e8;ces de pins</italic>." When Belon visited Turkey, he found a tree similar to the one at Fontainebleau, which was brought from Canada and called "Arbre de Vie". Moore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] citing the works of Bolle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and Annon. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], who both reexamined Belon's records, proposed that the identity of the Annedda was not eastern white cedar, but a five-needled white pine (<italic>Pinus strobus)</italic>. It is now evident that two trees of life were introduced from North America as exotic species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. "<italic>The fate of the pine at Fontainbleau is not known" </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Bolle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]<italic>"could not find any further record of eastern white pine growing in Europe until 150 years later when it was introduced into England</italic>".</p><p>In 1632, the botanical garden, established in Paris in 1632 by King Louis XIII of France, was intended for the cultivation of medicinal plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Landowners and naturalists were engaged in testing the effects of climate upon growing new exotic species arriving in France. A Bridgeman Art Library archive shows a "burgeoning bower" resembling eastern white pine in the botanical garden (Nature 2001, <bold>410</bold>, 303). The King's garden survived the French Revolution (1796&#x02013;1798) and its nurseries were used to provide patriotic 'trees of liberty'. They were planted in front of public buildings. The first trees of liberty were actually maypoles planted by peasants as a symbol of revolt against local lords in the winter of 1790.</p><p>Today, Annedda is commonly referred to as eastern white cedar or arborvitae <italic>(Thuja occidentalis </italic>L.<italic>)</italic>. This appellation was based on botanical evaluations, historical documents, naval and folklore medicine, notes of Cartier's contemporaries, and on the estimates of biochemical content of vitamin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The anti-scorbutic benefits of the candidate trees of life are abundant in the records and reviews of indigenous Maritime medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Conifers, native along the travel routes of Jacques Cartier, and with known high levels of vitamin C are <italic>Picea rubens</italic>, <italic>Pinus resinosa</italic>, <italic>Pinus nigra</italic>, and <italic>Pinus banksiana</italic>. In the "Native Trees of Canada", Canada Forest Service Bulletin 1919, No. 61 the botanical names of conifers had popular names. <italic>Thuja occidentalis </italic>was called cedar, and referred to as white cedar, and arborvitae. <italic>Pinus strobus </italic>was called white pine, and sometimes referred to as Weymouth pine, pattern pine, eastern white, yellow, and Quebec pine. <italic>Picea canadensis </italic>was called white spruce, and sometimes northern, skunk, cat spruce, and pine. <italic>Pinus banksiana </italic>was called jack pine and sometimes grey pine, cypress, juniper, and Banksian pine.</p><p>Today, the eastern white cedar (<italic>Thuja occidentalis </italic>L.) has the largest number of cultivars, and many do not resemble the species type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Mature trees will reach 30 to 40 feet tall with a spread of 15 feet. The upright cultivars are much shorter. The latter would unlikely be "<italic>as big as any oak in France</italic>". In eastern Canada, white pine was reported to reach a height of 250 feet and a diameter of 6 to 15 feet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conifer decoctions for the treatment of scurvy</title><p>Domagaia cured himself with the "<italic>the juice and sappe of the leaves of a certain tree</italic>". Adult scurvy is now treated with 300&#x02013;1000 mg of ascorbic acid per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In clinical dermatology, ascorbic acid is recommended three times a day, 100 mg is given until 4 g is reached, and then 100 mg/d becomes curative in days to weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Repletion studies demonstrated recovery from daily doses of only 6.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Larger doses gave more rapid improvement and increased ascorbic acid storage in the body. The plasma levels of ascorbic acid attained depended on body weight (dose per kg of body weight) and on whether or not any prior depletion had been adequately repleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In early explorers, a deficiency of vitamin C repeatedly caused morbidity and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Teas, brews, and beers, prepared from the needles of spruces and pines, were used to treat the symptoms of scurvy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Scurvy remedies were being made, sold and used under the name of "sapinette"[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].<italic>"According to the physician Gardane, in Des maladies des cr&#x000e9;oles (Paris 1784), this was a decoction of "sapin du Nord", or <underline>Picea abies</underline>. In Canada sapinette was made from the buds of the "Prussian fir", a name which was used indiscriminately for <underline>Abies alba</underline>, <underline>A. balsamea</underline>, and <underline>Picea abiesby</underline> Cartier. Sapinette was widely used in Canada, but the recipe seems to have come originally from the Baltic coast and sapinette was being used by the Russian navy long before the French took interest in it. The Russians in fact did use fermented pine buds with their fir decoction, though the species here is not specified. But it seems the French used fir, even in Canada" </italic>(Spary, personal communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]).</p><p>Spary writes, "<italic>The French were experimenting with sapinette on their long-distance voyages during the 1780s, and it was stocked on board the Laperouse expedition vessels"..." sapinette was bought ready-made from London. All things considered, this does not suggest that there was a direct connection between <underline>Pinus strobusin</underline> particular and the antiscorbutic programme, though it is entirely possible that this species was brought to Paris to be investigated for its virtues in that regard</italic>". The British knew of the anti-scorbutic benefits of sapinette and of lemons and oranges in a cure for scurvy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In 1753 scurvy was recognized by the British medical community as directly related to dietary deficiency.</p><p>Spruce beer was used as an anti-scorbuticum by James Cook in his second Pacific voyages in Western Canada (1772&#x02013;1775) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Cook obtained this recipe for spruce beer from Joseph Banks who had visited Newfoundland before Cook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The beer was prepared from fresh needles of a spruce tree, which in New Zealand was <italic>Dacrydium cupressinum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. On Cook's third voyage near Alaska, Sitka spruce (<italic>Picea sitchensis</italic>) was used but it was not as acceptable as the brew from <italic>Dacrydium</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. A similar drink called "Kallebogas" was used in Newfoundland. Variations involved the addition of rum and maple sugar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Vitamin C was first isolated from paprika, chemically identified, and its metabolic role worked out by Albert Szent-Gy&#x000f6;rgyi. He found that vitamin C also required cofactors to function properly. These cofactors are now known to be flavonoids.

At Stadaconna, the prescribed remedy of taking the Iroquois decoction "every other day" was consistent with this purpose.</p><p>The best-understood function of vitamin C is in the synthesis of collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Ascorbate is required for the hydroxylation of proline residues in procollagen. Procollagen is secreted by fibroblasts as a complex of three cross-linked polypeptide chains. Cross-linking requires the formation of covalent bonds between lysine residues. The hydroxylation of proline to hydroxyproline stabilizes the triple helix structure of collagen. This contributes to the formation of fibers, which can take several months, followed by scar formation, wound contraction and healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">106</xref>].</p><p>Collagen subunits contain a prolyl 4-hydroxylase with one atom of non-heme iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This enzyme requires &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate and oxygen as substrates. The &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate is oxidatively decarboxylated to carbon dioxide and succinate. A remaining oxygen atom is used to hydroxylate the proline residue in collagen. Heme iron is now oxidized to inactivate the enzyme.</p><p>Vitamin C deficiency leads to decreased collagen secretion due to capillary fragility. This is associated with defective connective tissues, poor wound healing, and susceptibility to sepsis.</p><p>The synthesis of NO by a heme-containing NOS would increase the circulation of oxygen supply in blood. The lack of vitamin C reduces the hydroxylation reactions needed for the synthesis of carnitine from lysine, and for the hydroxylation of dopamine to norepinephrine. The oxidation of tetrahydrofolic acid, which maintains adequate levels of folic acid and keeps iron in its reduced state, would be prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Vitamin C has nutritional value as a co-antioxidant by interacting with vitamin E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">107</xref>]. In the prevention of disease, intervention studies with vitamin C as an antioxidant have shown no clinical benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">108</xref>]. Arginine supplementation and the availability of other amino acids, such as proline and glutamate, would spare the energy costs in ATP equivalents for their synthesis as substrates for collagen, and other proteins in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">109</xref>].</p><p>In the winter, the Iroquois hunted a '<italic>number of wild animals such as fawns, stags, and bears, hares, martens, foxes, otters, and others</italic>" but they were stingy and brought Cartier's crew very few. The ice was extremely thick and the sailors were too weak to fish. They would not be seriously deficient in arginine as long as some meat and fish were available. Proteins are graded by "quality" on the basis of their content of essential amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">110</xref>], and arginine is conditionally essential. Intakes of 1 to 1.5 g protein (0.16 to 0.24 g N)/dg per d are common practice and usually advised.</p><p>In healthy adults, arginine is derived from the diet, endogenous synthesis, and turnover of body proteins. Arginine is usually ingested in diets at a rate of 3 to 5 g/d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>]. A common supplemental dose for arginine is 3 g which is taken by mouth three times a day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]</p><p>A kilogram of fresh spruce needles would contain 120 to 160 mg of free arginine N. More arginine would be available if the arginine-rich storage proteins of conifers were digested. Protein, ingested in amounts exceeding those needed to replace body losses, is deaminated. Its nitrogen is excreted as urea in urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">110</xref>].</p><p>In cases of catabolic stress or conditions involving a dysfunction of the kidneys or small intestine, the endogenous synthesis of arginine may not meet metabolic demands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The availability of arginine for metabolic functions is determined by its transporters in the plasma and mitochondrial membranes. During critical illness, gastric emptying would be delayed and small intestinal and colonic motility reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The rate-controlling enzymes in arginine synthesis and catabolism are argininosuccinate synthase, arginase isozymes, NOS, arginine decarboxylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Control is expressed according to cell type, age developmental stage, diet, and state of health and disease.</p><p>Four enzymes use arginine as a substrate: arginine decarboxylase, arginine:glycine amidinotransferase, arginase and its isoforms, and NOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The main products of the four enzymes are agmatine, guanidinoacetate and ornithine, ornithine and urea, and NO and citrulline. Arginine-derived guanidinoacetate is the immediate precursor for creatine, which maintains the energy metabolism of muscle, nerve and testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">112</xref>]. Creatine breaks down to creatinine at a constant rate and is cleared from the body by the kidneys.</p><p>In severe scurvy and in syndromes having pathological consequences, the correction of arginine deficiency could become a clinical priority. In critically ill patients, arginine maintains body homeostasis, muscle mass and function, and catabolic states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It triggers the body to make protein, prevents the wasting, and is used in the management of wounds in the lower extremities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">113</xref>]. Infectious complications become a serious problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B113">113</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">114</xref>]. Host invasion triggers an intense inflammatory response, which is then amplified by further pro-inflammatory cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>]. Severe cases are characterized by the rapid development of multiple organ failure resulting in mortality in excess of 40%. Dietary arginine supplementation helps to restore its plasma concentrations, boosts the immune system and helps to reduce neuropathy.</p><p>Clinical trials have used immune-enhancing enteral feeds that combine arginine with anti-inflammatory fatty acids, antioxidants, glutamine, and nucleotides. Glutamine has a potential beneficial metabolic effect in the critically ill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and in the treatment of infections in trauma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">115</xref>]. Glutamine is the principal fuel of enterocytes and lymphocytes. While doubt has been raised as to the value of arginine supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], due to the lack of its exact role in the regulation of immune functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>], the European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition has published guidelines recommending the routine use of arginine-containing diets in surgical patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">116</xref>]. An analysis of clinical studies using enteral formulas supplemented with arginine has suggested benefits upon outcomes from chronic and critical illness with little or no evidence of significant detrimental effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">117</xref>].</p><p>Today, vitamin and amino acid supplements have gained popularity as preventive or therapeutic agents. The excessive intake of high levels of a single amino acid or biofactor may be hazardous because of its potential for toxicity and control over genetic expressions. The effects of nutrients on gene expression are referred to as "nutrigenomics'. The study of the selective effects of arginine on gene expression is called 'argenomics'[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Did nitric oxide aid in the recovery from scurvy?</title><p>While we may never know the answer to this question, the discovery of the significance of NO in the human body remains as one of the most important developments in recent medical history. In 1987, NO production from arginine was first identified in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">118</xref>]. NO is a gas that transmits signals that are produced by one cell, penetrates through membranes, and regulates the function of another cell in humans and conifers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A recovery from scurvy involving NO occurs as a series of events over time. No model yet exists which integrates nutrition with vitamin C and NO in the Iroquois cure for scurvy.</p><p>In the severe winter at Stadaconna, the exposure of Cartier's crew to cold, poor diet, and insufficient vitamin C, would have benefited from the nutritional values of supplemental arginine, amino acids, and antioxidants. Boreal conifers lack nitrate because acid forest soils are poor in N and tissues contain little nitrate in the absence of fertilizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Nitrates and nitrites in the decoction would not have been available for their conversion to NO by the acidic gastric juice in the stomach. Readily available free arginine remains the main N source for NO which would kill almost all bacteria that were swallowed with food.</p><p>In clinical medicine and pharmacology, NO is a factor in treating intensive care patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">110</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>]. In tissues, it regulates oxygen release from red blood cells. NO protects the heart, stimulates the brain, and regulates inflammation. It improves blood circulation for the provision of essential amino acids, antioxidants and vitamins to tissues. NO is important for olfactory function and memory. White blood cells use NO to kill infectious bacteria, fungi and parasites. It defends against tumors by inducing apoptosis. Dosage is critical since NO can be toxic at high concentrations.</p><p>Levels of vitamin C were depleted during the severely cold winter. The mitochondria, being the responsible subcellular organelles for the oxidation of dietary and remaining stored fat, would generate almost all of the energy needed by humans. The oxidation of arginine to NO and citrulline is exothermic and occurs in mitochondria. Shivering generates body heat from muscles. Mitochondria generate most of the ATP that provides the energy for metabolism to occur.</p><p>In tissues that consume ATP rapidly, such as brain, and skeletal and smooth muscle, phosphocreatine serves as an energy reservoir for the rapid regeneration of ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B112">112</xref>]. Mitochondrial creatine kinase produces ATP from ADP by converting creatine phosphate to creatine in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Creatine kinase is routinely determined in emergency patients because its elevated activity is an indication of damage to muscles, renal failure, and myocardial infarction. The oxidative reactions in mitochondria are also a major source of potentially damaging oxygen free radicals. Reactions with NO can remove these radicals, and stimulate the formation of new and larger mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">119</xref>], which in turn would improve body bioenergetics.</p><p>Arginine is metabolized via mitochondria and in the cytosol via the urea cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The cytosol makes up the cytoplasm of cells. It contains thousands of enzymes. Some act synergistically with vitamin C to provide a cure for scurvy and others aid in the recovery to health. NO, formed by the turnover of body proteins and supplemented by arginine from the decoction would reduce excessive stress, provide a targeted redistribution of energy resources to the vital organs, and activate a series of early and late-expressing genes as the body recovers. At the recovery stage, NO would participate in the maintenance of long-term health.</p><p>Arginine, amino acids and vitamin C are absorbed into circulation by the small intestine, and carried to collagen-rich cells throughout the body. Endothelial cells, which make up the capillaries and line blood vessels and the lymph ducts, use arginine to make NO. NO diffuses into the smooth muscle cells that surround the endothelial lining of blood vessels. This leads to muscle relaxation resulting in more blood flow to tissues, brain, lungs, kidneys, liver and other vital organs. Blood pressure is lowered. Blood flow and blood vessel diameter are improved, and the formation of blood clots would be reduced and repaired. The improvement of heart function would allow more oxygen, nutrients, vitamins, and amino acids to aid in the recovery from scurvy.</p><p>Improved circulation would relieve tension, sore muscles, the pain caused by swelling, and the accumulation of excess fluids in Cartier's crew and in Domagaia's legs. Wound healing would increase and mineral depletion would be reduced. NO is an important regulator in immune cells which fight infections and viruses. It aids in the killing of bacteria and engulfed pathogens found within the lysosomes of macrophages, which remove harmful cellular debris and dead cells. NO is a scavenger for cytotoxic free radicals that contribute to aging. NO, being involved in the transmission of messages between nerve cells connected with memory, sleeping and learning would support the wellness of sailors for their return to France.</p><p>Human NOS has three distinct isoforms having a multitude of organ-specific regulatory functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A constitutive form (nNOS) is found in neural tissue, and a second constitutive form (eNOS) is found in the vascular endothelium. Both are regulated by calcium and calmodulin. A third calcium-independent form (iNOS) occurs in a variety of cells after induction with inflammatory mediators and bacterial products. During inflammation, arginine transport increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The activation of iNOS or arginase, or both, reflects the type of inflammatory response in the development of specific diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>]. Sepsis, which occurred in Cartier's critically ill crew, probably involved a predominant role for arginine and iNOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">117</xref>]. Septic shock is a life threatening complication that can have a mortality rate of 50 to 80%. Trauma exhibits a preferential induction of arginase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">111</xref>]. Arginase would reduce the arginine available as a substrate for NOS.</p><p>The formation of <italic>S</italic>-nitrosothiols provides a different mode of transporting NO, offers a buffering system that regulates the bioavailability of NO, and increases the range of NO action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">120</xref>]. In plants and humans, glutamine serves as an antioxidant by enhancing the levels of glutathione resulting in the formation of <italic>S</italic>-nitrosoglutathione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B121">121</xref>]. Some <italic>S</italic>-nitrosothiols (<italic>S</italic>-nitrosocysteine, <italic>S</italic>-nitrosohomocysteine) are taken up into cells via the amino acid transport system. <italic>S</italic>-Nitrosothiols are being considered as exogenous sources of NO for the treatment of NO-deficient pathological states. They are cleared to ameliorate nitrosative stress. They regulate innate immune and vascular function. <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation may also contribute to the posttranslational modification of proteins involved in the regulation of NO action and in the recovery from scurvy. The nitrosylation of cysteine thiols is recognized as critical for the mechanism of NO function in health and disease.</p><p>Without clinical trials, it is not clear how quickly Cartier's crew would have recovered if given only vitamin C. It is evident that the decoction with vitamin C, arginine, the essential amino acids, antioxidants and other unidentified biofactors integrated with NO production in the body and aided in the recovery from scurvy.</p></sec><sec><title>Guanidino compounds as NOS regulators and metabolic markers</title><p>The inappropriate release of NO is linked to the pathogenesis of a number of disease states. High levels of NO interact with molecular oxygen and superoxide radicals to produce damaging peroxynitrite that modifies proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids with harmful effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">122</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">123</xref>]. The need to regulate NO production has led to the development of modulators and inhibitors of NOS activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">122</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">125</xref>]. L-arginine analogues have the advantage of being closely related to the substrate itself and may be taken up by amino acid transporters. The guanidino compounds that interfere with the binding of arginine to NOS have been the most extensively researched as drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In general, guanidino-substituted L-arginine molecules are effective but they show little selectivity for the NOS isoforms. <italic>N</italic><sup><italic>&#x003c9;</italic></sup>-Methylations of the guanidino moiety of L-arginine have yielded potent NOS inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Their use in treating septic shock provided hemodynamic stabilization in a large number of patients. While <italic>N</italic><sup><italic>&#x003c9;</italic></sup>-methylated guanidino compounds have not yet been identified in conifers, they effectively inhibit NOS activity when fed to a variety of conifers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>]. L-arginine analogues with substitutions on their carbon chains, and lacking the &#x003b1;-amino group or &#x003b1;-carboxyl groups are inactive as inhibitors and as substrates for NOS. These include guanidinoacetic and &#x003b3;-guanidobutyric acid.</p><p>Reviews of the physiological effects of natural and synthetic guanidino compounds in research and clinical practice are available in several books [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">126</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B128">128</xref>]. Among the known guanidino compounds in conifers, &#x003b1;-keto-&#x003b4;-guanidinobutyric acid and &#x003b3;-guanidinobutyric acid are found in nerve tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B129">129</xref>] and in the urine of hyperarginemic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B130">130</xref>]. Agmatine, a decarboxylation product of arginine, which occurs in conifers, has various pharmacological effects, but little is known about its metabolism and human physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Guanidino compounds have been used as respiratory inhibitors, antibiotics, markers for metabolic disorders, and in studies of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and microbial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">126</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B128">128</xref>]. Markers carry information about the sites and pathological cause. In uremia, guanidine, guanidinosuccinic acid and creatinine are greatly increased in biological fluids and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B131">131</xref>]. Guanidino compounds are implicated in hypertension, anaesthesia, hemorrhagic shock, seizure, renal dysfunction, and immersion stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B132">132</xref>]. &#x003b3;-Guanidinobutyric acid reacts with hydroxyl radicals and induces epileptic discharges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127">127</xref>]. Its transamidination precursors are &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid and arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B129">129</xref>].</p><p>Guanidine and the guanidino compounds have been used to treat botulism, viral diseases, diabetes, and paraneoplastic syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B132">132</xref>]. Evidence for mechanisms of action, dosing, pharmokinetics, cautions, interactions and clinical applications remains preliminary. Synthetic guanidino compounds are used in the treatment of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Type II diabetes is one of the most serious health problems for Native Americans in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B133">133</xref>]. Pharmacogenetic differences, which diminish or enhance the predicted response, would indicate an inherited defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">107</xref>]. The surprisingly wide and natural diversity of chemically identified guanidino compounds in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B134">134</xref>] may yet offer new biofactors and drugs in understanding ethnomedicine, in treating diseases, and for their contribution to regimens for human wellness.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The history of the native indigenous peoples of eastern Canada has provided evidence of a culture strong enough to withstand the most difficult hardships. Their coniferous forests have had a pervasive influence on offering a source of food, fibre, protection, and medicinal products for human survival. In the absence of forensic evidence and apart from being a source of vitamin C, the formulary nature of the decoctions from Annedda to cure scurvy and hasten the recovery of the sailors is a story that may never be completely solved nor will it end here. We do not really know the true identity of Annedda. This tree, known today as arborvitae, has subsequently been represented by many candidate coniferous trees of life.</p><p>When food was short and the winter most severe, the candidate trees of life in eastern Canada provided a source of vitamins, arginine, proline, other conditionally and essential amino acids, antioxidants, and other biofactors, which aided in the recovery from of scurvy. The discovery of vitamins and amino acids played an important role in understanding human nutrition. For the discovery of the importance of arginine-derived NO in clinical nutrition we are indebted to the investigators who were honoured by the Nobel Prize in 1998.</p><p>After the transfer of the tree of life to France, old principles were now viewed in new ways. Jean Fernel (1497&#x02013;1558), a foremost figure in the French Renaissance of science and medicine, broke away from the irrationality of occultism and magic that had dominated medieval natural philosophy and medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B135">135</xref>]. His treatises on "Physiologia", first published in 1542, created debate in Europe for the next 100 years, and laid the "seeds of systems biology"[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B136">136</xref>]. To learn from history, we must transform it into a science.</p><p>Clinical nutrition is now faced with a vast amount of data from the ethnobotanical and ethnomedical literature. The detailed interdisciplinary and systematic understanding of the complex interactions among anatomy, histology, pathology, neurology, nutrition, and metabolism represents a modern-day challenge. The genetic loci of many controlling quantitative traits have been identified and are being compared in ill and healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B137">137</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B139">139</xref>]. Through genomics, argenomics, nutrigenomics, and other "omics" technologies, we expect to have a better understanding of how the control of complex traits would aid the recovery from sickness and diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Integrated databases are being developed to describe the toxological, pharmaceutical, nutritional and environmental effects of diets and drugs on disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B140">140</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B143">143</xref>].</p><p>The history of medicine and clinical practice has involved a succession of blind alleys and detours, mountains of often uninterpretable observations, and a great leap forward as in the discovery of vitamin C as a cure for scurvy. This review takes us centuries back, and turns our attention to the combined values of arginine, NO, proline, other conditionally and essential amino acids, guanidino compounds, and antioxidants as added factors in the food and medicines of indigenous Canadian peoples.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author declares that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The author in indebted to Mary Moore (1978) at Petawawa regarding the identity of Annedda.
