Several molecular biology-based methods have been recently developed for microbial diagnostics and offer noticeable advantages over conventional techniques in microbiology. Among the molecular biology-based methods, DNA microarray technology presents the potential of direct and rapid identification of multiple DNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A microarray displaying DNA probes corresponding to a collection of genes of a broad spectrum of pathogens is a powerful tool for simultaneous species identification, detection of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Major drawbacks in using DNA microarrays as a standard technique for pathogen detection are linked to the low representation of pathogen DNA in the analytes, but also to the relatively low sensitivity of fluorescence-based microarrays. The amount of specific pathogen DNA present in clinical, environmental, and food samples is sometimes as low as few femtograms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], while the detection limit for genomic DNA in fluorescence-based microarrays, without any pre-amplification, is in the range of micrograms to nanograms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>A solution to overcome this intrinsic weakness of fluorescence-based microarrays is to specifically amplify the pathogen DNA fraction in the sample in order to increase the sensitivity level of detection. The question of random or selective pathogen DNA amplification prior to DNA microarray detection has been already addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and applications of multiplex PCR using a small number of primer pairs corresponding to the capture probes on low density microarrays have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We present here a further development of this approach, by proposing a large scale multiplex PCR adapted to the format of a prototype medium density microarray developed in our laboratory, employing up to 800 specific primer pairs. The limiting conditions for the LSplex PCR protocol are empirically determined and the resulting amplification biases are evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Strains of microorganisms used for the preparation of DNA templates</title><p>Template DNA was prepared from the following bacterial and fungal reference strains, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.), the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) or the Collection de l'Institut Pasteur, (CIP, Paris, France): <italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>(ATCC 29213 and CIP 65.6), <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis </italic>(ATCC 12228), <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>(ATCC 25922 and CIP 105893), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>(ATCC 27853 and CIP 105765), <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae </italic>(DSM 681), <italic>Proteus mirabilis </italic>(DSM 788), <italic>Enterococcus faecalis </italic>(ATCC 29212), <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae </italic>(CIP 106577), <italic>Streptococcus mitis </italic>(CIP 104997), <italic>Candida albicans </italic>(ATCC 10231).

Primers for the selected sequences were designed with the help of Primer3 search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] in order to produce amplicons of 200 to 800 bp length (primer sequences and their characteristics are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>Negative controls comprising genes of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus </italic>and <italic>Hordeum vulgaris </italic>and positive controls (16S rRNA genes of several bacterial species) were also included.

All cloned gene segments were amplified from the plasmids and diluted in 25% DMSO at a concentration of 200 mg/L. For printing the microarrays a BioRobotics Microgrid 610 spotter (Genomic Solutions, Huntingdon, UK) and Ultra-GAPS&#x02122; coated glass slides (Corning Incorporated, Corning, USA) were used and conditions for printing were as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The complete array of 930 gene amplicons was spotted in 2 replicates per slide, each replicate containing 2 spots of the same probe, therefore totaling 4 replicates of each probe.

A primer mix was used with a final concentration of in general 0.02 &#x003bc;M of each primer. Reactions in a total volume of 50 &#x003bc;L were performed with 2 U either of Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) (<italic>standard LSplex</italic>) or Vent exo<sup>- </sup>DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) (<italic>optimized LSplex</italic>). Standard LSplex using Taq DNA polymerase amplification reactions contained 1&#x000d7; KCl PCR buffer (Fermentas), 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.2 mM of dATP, dCTP, gGTP, and dTTP (Sigma).

The LSplex PCR protocols using Taq or Vent exo<sup>- </sup>DNA polymerases were modified as follows: 1) for direct labelling the amount of dTTP was reduced to 0.15 mM and 0.05 mM of Alexa Fluor 546-14-dUTP was added (ChromaTide Labelled Nucleotides, Molecular Probes, Willow Creek, US). 2) for indirect labelling the amount of dTTP was reduced to 0.13 mM and 0.07 mM aminoallyl-dUTP was added (ARES DNA labelling Kit, Invitrogen). Amino-modified amplified DNA was spin purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), eluted in 60 &#x003bc;L nuclease-free water (pH 8), analyzed by spectrophotometry, freeze-dried (Lyovac GT2, Finn-Aqua, Huerth, Germany), resuspended in 5 &#x003bc;L nuclease-free water and subsequently stained with Alexa-fluor 555 or 647.</p></sec><sec><title>3.

The labelling efficiency was evaluated by calculating the approximate ratio of bases to dye molecules. This ratio and the amount of recovered labelled DNA was determined by measuring the absorbance of the undiluted purified LS-Plex products at 260 nm and the absorbance of the dye at its absorbance maximum using a lambda40 UV-spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer) and plastic disposable cuvettes for the range from 220 nm to 700 nm (UVette; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Microarray hybridization and analysis</title><p>In order to provide a complete evaluation of the LSplex protocol using genus-specific and high complexity primer mixes, amplified products were hybridized to a prototype microarray designed to identify pathogenic microorganisms involved in sepsis.</p><p>All amplifications were performed at least twice for each condition indicated. Each experiment described in the present study represent co-hybridization of two different DNA samples (LSplex amplified and genomic DNA for comparison) labelled with Cy3, Alexa 546 or Alexa 555 and Cy5 or Alexa 647 respectively. After purification, DNA samples labelled with distinguishable fluorophores were pooled and 10 &#x003bc;g of Salmon Sperm DNA were added. The whole yield of one amplification reaction was used for one labeling and hybridization experiment. The mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried (Lyovac GT2, Finn-Aqua, Huerth, Germany) in the dark. Hybridization was automatically performed with a TECAN hybridization station (HS400, TECAN, Salzburg, Austria). The microarray slides were prewashed with 5 &#x000d7; SSC then 110 &#x003bc;L of pre-hybridization buffer (25% Formamide, 5 &#x000d7; SSC, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml BSA) were added and incubated for 30 minutes at 42&#x000b0;C with mild agitation. Lyophilized labelled DNA was resuspended in 110 &#x003bc;L of hybridization buffer (25% Formamide, 5 &#x000d7; SSC, 0.1% SDS), denatured for 3 minutes at 90&#x000b0;C, and injected into the hybridization chambers. Hybridization was performed for 18 hours at 42&#x000b0;C. After hybridization the arrays were automatically washed at 42&#x000b0;C in 1 &#x000d7; SSC/0.1% SDS, three cycles of 30 sec wash time and 2 min soak time, then in 0.1 &#x000d7; SSC/0.1% SDS, five cycles of 30 sec wash time and 2 min soak time, in 0.1 &#x000d7; SSC, four cycles of 30 sec wash time and 2 min soak time and finally dried at 30&#x000b0;C with N<sub>2 </sub>(270 MPa) for 5 min.</p><p>Hybridized arrays were scanned with a GenePix Personal Axon 4100A laser scanner (Axon Instruments, Union city, CA). Laser light of wavelengths at 532 and 635 nm were used to excite Cy3/Alexa546/Alexa555 dyes and Cy5/Alexa647 dyes, respectively. Fluorescent images were analyzed by the GenePixPro software (v.6.0) and Acuity (v.4.0) (Axon Instruments). The intensity of fluorescence of each spot was measured and the mean of 4 replicate spots per probe was calculated. Local background fluorescence was also measured and subtracted from the mean fluorescence. Spots displaying fluorescence greater than mean fluorescence of all spots on the array plus two times standard deviation (SD) were considered as positive. The hybridization was considered successful if spiked and control spots produced positive signals. Presence of more than 5 positive spots from same species was interpreted as positivity of the sample for this pathogen species. The fidelity limit of LSplex was defined as minimal amount of DNA necessary to obtain the hybridization pattern with &#x0003e;95% correspondence to one from the 2 &#x003bc;g genomic DNA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have recently established a prototype medium-density gene-segment DNA microarray for the detection and genetic profiling of pathogens causing bloodstream infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The limit of detection of such medium-density gene-segment DNA microarrays was previously identified and ranged between 10 and 100 ng of DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This microarray has been extended for the present study to represent specific gene fragments of more than 20 of the most prominent causative agents of sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. As expected the sensitivity of detection was not influenced by the extension of the microarray. This was confirmed experimentally by hybridizing decreasing amounts of bacterial genomic DNA (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). At the nanogram level a striking reduction in the detection power was observed and the number of detected genes was gradually reduced. In order to improve the sensitivity of detection we focused on the development of an amplification protocol by multiplex PCR.</p><sec><title>Large scale multiplex PCR with 800-primer pairs (LSplex)</title><p>The amplification of unidentified pathogen DNA requires that all necessary primer pairs are present in the amplification mix. We have initially addressed the question whether it is possible to amplify genomic DNA of several bacterial species by a PCR containing 800 primer pairs (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). However, the complexity of the primer mix did not allow the amplification of any genomic DNA at a final primer concentration of 0.2 &#x003bc;M (data not shown). Nevertheless, reducing the primer concentration in the amplification reaction to 0.02 &#x003bc;M permitted amplification from 100 ng of some DNA templates, although the amplification of most DNA templates was very weak (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). It was not possible to further decrease the final concentration of individual primers without a negative effect on the amplification yield (not shown). Furthermore, DNA templates from Gram-negative bacteria could not be amplified using Taq DNA polymerase at any primer concentration (not shown). An optimized protocol using Vent exo<sup>- </sup>DNA polymerase permitted the amplification of these templates with 800-primer pairs at different concentrations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). LSplex produced patterns corresponding to the expected size range of PCR products, where each band represents the collection of many amplicons of approximately the same size. Furthermore, absence of amplification was observed in reactions without or with unrelated DNA (e.g. human genomic DNA) indicating specific amplification of bacterial DNA (data not shown). Best results were obtained with final primer concentrations between 0.01 and 0.05 &#x003bc;M and with a primer concentration of 0.02 &#x003bc;M we successfully amplified an expanded panel of test species including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as <italic>Candida albicans </italic>DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Large scale multiplex PCR with 800 primer pairs</bold>.

Additionally, the impact of different labeling methods on general LSplex specificity and sensitivity upon microarray hybridization were evaluated.</p><p>The possibility of directly incorporating fluorescent nucleotides during LSplex amplification was examined. Chromatide Alexa Fluor 546-47-dUTPs were used for amplification but resulted in a rather weak incorporation ratio (one fluorescent nucleotide each 139 bases) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The corresponding hybridization profile of <italic>S. aureus </italic>specific probes was barely more informative than the one obtained with 10 ng of non-amplified genomic DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><p>The indirect labeling of LSplex products by incorporating aminoallyl-modified nucleotides during amplification, with subsequent staining by amino reactive fluorescent dyes, was a potential alternative to Klenow labeling with one tagged nucleotide per 64 bases. Some probes displayed reduced fluorescence when compared to the fluorescence levels obtained with LSplex amplification plus Klenow labeling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). For example the 2<sup>nd </sup>catalase probe (cata), the 4<sup>th </sup>coagulase (coa), bsaG, all capsular polysaccharide type 5 related genes (cap5), the gamma hemolysin (hglA), and the enterotoxines G (seg) and T15 (set15) showed weaker signals but were nonetheless identified as positive. Notably, LSplex amplification combined with indirect labeling granted a saving of one hour time compared to LSplex amplification with subsequent Klenow-labeling (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Limits of sensitivity of LSplex</title><p>Next we wished to determine the minimum amount of target DNA efficiently supporting the optimized LSplex amplification protocol. Agarose gel electrophoresis was unable to detect the LSplex amplification products from templates containing less than 10 ng of DNA (10<sup>5</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>6 </sup>genomic equivalents) from several bacterial species (not shown).</p><p>However, after fluorescent labeling of the amplification products followed by microarray hybridization strong signals were readily detected. In fact, LSplex amplification (with 800 primer pairs) of 10 ng and also of 1 ng of DNA template resulted in a hybridization pattern mostly identical to the one obtained with 2 &#x003bc;g of genomic DNA, while 10 ng of the same genomic DNA were below the limit of sensitivity of the microarray for pathogen detection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The hybridization pattern obtained with 100 ng genomic DNA showed 22 mismatches compared to 2 &#x003bc;g. In contrast, LSplex on 1 ng template displayed a hybridization profile comparable to the one obtained with 2 &#x003bc;g of non amplified DNA, although the amplification of certain probes was diminished. For instance, lipase (lip) delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (hemB) and Pantone-Valentine leukocidin F subunit (lukF) were poorly amplified and fell below detection threshold. Most of the LSplex products amplified from 0.1 ng or 0.01 ng (not shown) template were below the limit of detection of the microarray analysis, making species identification impossible. Thus application of LSplex increases the microarray detection of target templates by a factor of 10<sup>2 </sup>to 10<sup>3 </sup>with &#x0003e;95% fidelity.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Enhancement of sensitivity of pathogen DNA detection by microarray by LSplex amplification</bold>.

The specificity of the LSplex protocol was evaluated by measuring the fluorescent signals in the whole array after hybridization with LSplex products (800 primer pairs) obtained from 10 ng of DNA (approx 10<sup>5 </sup>genomic equivalents) of 9 different species of pathogens (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus </italic>ATCC 29213, <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>ATCC 25922, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae </italic>CIP 106577, <italic>Enterococcus faecalis </italic>ATCC 29212, <italic>Proteus mirabilis </italic>DSM 788, <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis </italic>ATCC 12228, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae </italic>DSM 681, <italic>Candida albicans </italic>ATCC 10231 and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>ATCC 27853).

Such swabs represent one of the most frequent materials processed by microbiological diagnostics. Swabs from superficial wounds contain one or more pathogens, normal skin flora and few human cells. The number of bacteria on swabs is usually low, so that time consuming amplification via subculture on microbiological media is required. DNA was isolated from three swabs taken from the same patient. DNA preparations were pooled and divided into two samples of approximately 20 ng each. One sample was subjected to LSplex (800 primer pairs). Other labeled directly prior to hybridization with the microarray. A typical hybridization pattern is depicted in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. The directly labeled DNA hybridized only with 16S RNA probes (positive controls) indicating the presence of bacterial DNA in the sample (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, the hybridization of directly labeled DNA did not allow identification of the pathogen species. This was not due to inefficient labeling of the DNA as demonstrated by strong hybridization of the control DNA spiked into the labeling reaction. In contrast, LSplex amplified swab DNA hybridized with probes of <italic>Enterococcus faecium </italic>and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The presence of these bacterial species was confirmed by routine microbiological culture followed by biochemical characterization. It should be noted that LSplex of the DNA from swab resulted in hybridization of a few probes from other bacteria (one of from <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, two from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, three from <italic>S. aureus </italic>and one from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>) which were not identified by microbiological culture. These, however were only singletons in the redundant set of dozens of species-specific probes, allowing the correct identification of pathogens present in the specimen. In summary the results of LSplex amplification of DNA from cotton swabs followed by microarray were in concordance with the standard microbiological techniques, whilst direct microarray identification of the pathogens was not successful.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Application of LSplex for detection of bacterial mixtures from clinical specimens</bold>.

To compensate for the low sensitivity of such a multi-capture probe detection system, microarray analysis can be preceded of pathogen isolation and clonal expansion as a source for abundant DNA. A pre-amplification of the target DNA using a single-step Large Scale multiplex PCR (LSplex) could avoid such a time-consuming procedure. Although it is generally accepted that Multiplex PCR is potentially an ideal co-adjuvant for DNA microarrays in pathogen detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] there is, nevertheless, a limitation in the number of distinct PCR products that can be generated. Up to date, multiplex PCR was only combined with low-density microarray formats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and required either several parallel multiplex PCR reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or subsequent PCR steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The complex nature of the interference between multiple primer pairs and targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] has limited conventional multiplex PCR in solution phase to a dozen of primer pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Antagonizing the typical hindrances of highly multiplexed PCR requires innovative technical platforms as for instance performing on-chip amplification with primers attached to a solid support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Another alternative approach applied to solution-phase highly multiplex PCR has been the replacement of target-specific primers with universal ones. However, this process involves multiple steps starting with enzymatic digestion of the template DNA, ligation to adapters, primer extension and finally two subsequent PCR reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Such multi-step approaches are time consuming and prone to contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and therefore have not been recommended for bacteriological routine diagnostics.</p><p>The coupling of a pre-processing multiplex PCR to a medium-density microarray format, displaying hundreds of probes for identification and virulence profile typing of several pathogenic species, requires an unbiased multi-target amplification corresponding to several dozens of specific capture probes characterizing a certain pathogen. Since the presence and concentration of the particular pathogen in a microbiological laboratory is unknown, the multiplex reaction should include as many primer pairs as capture probes are present on the microarray. Moreover, the reaction has to cope with femtograms of pathogen template DNA whose GC-content can range between 30 and 70% and which is mixed with nanograms of human DNA.</p><p>We have shown high fidelity amplification of specific DNA targets using pools of species-specific mixes of up to 800 primer pairs, which improves the sensitivity of the microarray detection of pathogens by a factor of 2 to 3-logs.</p><p>By using <italic>S. aureus </italic>DNA (strain ATCC 29213) as template for amplification, we demonstrated that LSplex tolerates the increase in primer mix complexity until at least 800 primer pairs, without significant reduction in the profiling fidelity. LSplex products amplified from 10 and even 1 ng of template generated fluorescent signals as strong as those produced by micrograms of genomic DNA. Nevertheless, the comparison between LSplex hybridization profiles and the ones obtained with 2 &#x003bc;g of <italic>S. aureus </italic>showed that some probes were poorly amplified with the high complexity primer mixes. These probes produced a strong fluorescent signal when hybridized with genomic DNA but upon the LSplex protocol they were not considered as positive since their fluorescence difference was less then 2 times SD to the mean fluorescence intensity of the whole microarray. This problem of under-amplification of some targets might be circumvented by a specific increase in the concentration of primer pairs amplifying these specific targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Such a balancing strategy for individual primer pairs could be applied on the whole set of primers, following a broad comparison between hybridization profiles generated by genomic DNA of many reference strains of all species of interest and the LSplex amplified products. In this way, the amount of all primer pairs responsible for low amplification yield can be adjusted. Cut-off values supporting the decision between positive or negative signals are determined empirically and should be specifically adapted to different experimental setups. Although several calculation methods are described in the literature, they basically represent subjective evaluation of the signal to noise ratio. Some authors consider a signal positive when it is only two or three times higher than the assay background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], while others take only signals ten times higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The fact that the LSplex protocol could allow concomitant amplification and labelling represents a valuable feature for future application in diagnostics since it should reduce the total time required for providing the identification of the pathogen. The optimized LSplex protocol using Vent exo<sup>- </sup>performed reliable amplification and efficient incorporation of amino-allyl modified nucleotides, allowing indirect labelling of PCR products. However, direct incorporation of fluorescent nucleotides during the multiplex PCR under the same amplification conditions led to weak label incorporation making the separate labelling step necessary to achieve a good profiling fidelity. Alternatively, the use of labelled primers can be employed for obtaining fluorescent multiplex PCR products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>LSplex successfully amplified less than 10 nanograms of DNA from several different pathogens (Gram-positive, Gram-negative and fungi) generating signals in general stronger and more specific than the ones generated with 2&#x02013;5 micrograms of DNA. LSplex improved the specificity of the hybridization assay and enriched the sample for the target sequences present in the template. Interestingly, <italic>Candida albicans </italic>produced non-detectable signals when 2 &#x003bc;g of genomic DNA are used for hybridization. After amplification of 10 ng of <italic>C. albicans </italic>DNA by LSplex protocol resulted in the clear hybridization pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>We would like to emphasize that a reduction in the limit of sensitivity of the LSplex protocol to picograms or to femtograms would be desirable in order to detected pathogens directly from every clinical, food or environmental samples.</p><p>In the last two years the publication of several reports referring to rapid identification of bacterial species by multiplex PCR coupled to microarrays detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] demonstrated the usefulness of this approach and the growing interest in implementing it in routine diagnostics. It also underlines the necessity of finding robust protocols for amplifying the target DNA before microarray analysis.</p><p>Whole genome amplification (WGA) is a powerful technique for the amplification of total genomic DNA (e.g. for comparative hybridization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]). However, the random priming employed in WGA will amplify every DNA in the sample. Therefore, the application of WGA is difficult if the DNA of interest is contaminated by unwanted DNA. This is the case in clinical microbiology settings where DNA extracted directly from patient sample contains a significant amount of human DNA. LSplex would amplify selectively the underrepresented bacterial DNA. The large set of primer pairs is potentially able to amplify as many gene segments as probes are immobilized on the prototype microarray but in practice, it is supposed to only amplify the gene-segments specific to the pathogens present in the analyte.</p><p>In parallel, real-time PCR-based assays for identification of pathogens were proposed since the sensitivity is adequate for direct detection and quantification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. However, the information level obtained by this approach is incomparably lower than the one provided by medium or high density microarray analyses. Real-time PCR has a reduced potential for multiplexing because the current availability of only four to five channels for the simultaneous non-overlapping detection of different fluorophores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. For this reason, real-time PCR is in general confined to a mere species identification based on single sequence polymorphism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] or to confirm the presence of a suspected pathogen by using a reduced number of specific primer pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] eventually completed by the detection of a few genes related to antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In contrast, microarrays offer the possibility to profile pathogens by providing information at the strain level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], by detecting virulence factors and genes determining the antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The LSplex amplification protocol is a promising co-adjuvant for pathogen profiling by microarray analysis since it increases sensitivity and the specificity of detection. It also presents the flexibility of using hundreds of primer pairs, whose sequences are exchangeable in function of the pathogens targeted in the microarray. The single-step LSplex protocol, allowing labelling during amplification, could represent one piece of the methodological mosaic in a future time-saving bacteriological diagnostic approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MPS established and performed LSplex PCRs, BEC performed microarray hybridizations, LE designed and produces microarrays, MK and OK performed data analysis and wrote manuscript.
