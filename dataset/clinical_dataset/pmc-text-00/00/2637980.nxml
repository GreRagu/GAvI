How fish embryos survive pathogenic attacks remains poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that the maternal immunization of female zebrafish with formalin-killed <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> causes a significant increase in C3 and Bf contents in the mother, a corresponding rise in the offspring, and induces a remarkable increase in the hemolytic activities in both the mother and offspring. In addition, the embryos derived from the immunized mother are significantly more tolerant to <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> challenge than those from the unimmunized fish, and blocking C3 and Bf activities by injection of the antibodies against C3 and Bf into the embryos render them more susceptible to <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>.

These transferred maternal molecules have been proposed to be involved in the early defense against pathogens in developing fish embryos and larvae. For example, Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004498-Wang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> have recently demonstrated by an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay system of complement activity that the the protection of early embryos of zebrafish <italic>Danio rerio</italic> against microbial attack can be attributed to maternal complement components operating via the alternative pathway (AP). However, it remains unknown whether these alternative complement components function <italic>in vivo</italic> during the early developmental stages. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to examine if the maternal alternative complement components are transferred from the immunized female <italic>D. rerio</italic> to offspring, and if so, to test if these components transferred affect the offspring immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Increase in C3 and Bf in immunized fish and eggs</title><p>The protein contents of the whole body homogenates (WBHs) and egg extracts ranged from 13.1 to15.3 mg/ml, and from 15.7 to 18.6 mg/ml, respectively. Our previous study showed that the key components, complement component 3 (C3) and factor B (Bf), functioning in the AP, are present in the early embryos of <italic>D. rerio</italic>, and the complement system operating via the AP is largely attributable to the bacteriolytic activity in the early embryos, therefore the contents of C3 and Bf were determined and compared between the WBHs and egg extracts. Injection of PBS into female <italic>D. rerio</italic> resulted in little changes in C3 and Bf contents in both the WBHs and egg extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004498-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). In contrast, the immunization with formalin-killed <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> induced a significant increase in C3 and Bf levels in both the WBHs and egg extracts. The C3 and Bf levels in the WBHs peaked at week 2 and week 1, respectively, following the primary immunization; they both decreased slightly and then increased significantly after the secondary immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004498-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A and C</bold></xref>). Interestingly, the maternal immunization also caused a marked corresponding rise in C3 and Bf levels in the egg extracts, and the fluctuation profile of the C3 and Bf contents in the egg extracts generally coincided with that in the WBHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004498-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B and D</bold></xref>). This indicated that the maternal immunization induced a significant increase of C3 and Bf levels in the mothers, which in turn resulted in a marked increase in C3 and Bf levels in their eggs. Moreover, the statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the peak values of C3 and Bf amounts in both the WBHs and egg extracts after the primary and secondary immunizations, suggesting that the secondary immunization caused a significant increase in these factors in the mothers as well as in the offspring.</p><fig id="pone-0004498-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004498.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Influence of maternal immunization on C3 and Bf levels in the WBHs and egg extracts.</title><p>Three immunized female <italic>D. rerio</italic> and three control females as well as their released eggs were sampled every 7 days after the primary immunization.

In contrast, similar studies focussing on innate immune factors are much more limited.

It was found that the maternal immunization also causes a remarkable increase in the hemolytic activity in the mother and a corresponding increase in the offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004498-g002"><bold>Figs. 2</bold></xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004498-g003"><bold>3</bold></xref>). Furthermore, the developing embryos derived from the immunized <italic>D. rerio</italic> are significantly more tolerant than those from the unimmunized mother upon challenge with <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004498-g004"><bold>Figs. 4</bold></xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004498-g005"><bold>5</bold></xref>). Moreover, abrogation of C3 and Bf activities by injection of the antibodies against C3 and Bf into the developing embryos to block the AP, followed by the challenge with <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>, leads to a significantly increased mortality in the target embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004498-g006"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref>). Taken together, these data clearly show that not only C3 and Bf are able to be transferred from the immunized female <italic>D. rerio</italic> to offspring, but these factors are also able to confer protection to the offspring as well. This appears the first report elucidating the protective role <italic>in vivo</italic> of maternally-transferred alternative complement components in the developing embryos of non-mammalian vertebrates.</p><p>Complement is a sophisticated proteolysis system which plays two major roles in humoral immunity: one is to lyse pathogenic cells directly; and the other is to opsonize pathogens for phagocytosis and to recruit immunocytes to the reaction focus. The present study clearly shows the presence of C3 and Bf inside the eggs/embryos. As the macrophages are not observed in <italic>D. rerio</italic> embryos younger than 2-day-old larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004498-Herbomel1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004498-Lieschke1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, the key components C3 and Bf functioning in the AP may exert their antibacterial activity by interacting with and destabilizing the invading pathogens, leading to the pathogenic cell lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004498-g005"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>). In agreement, the maternally transferred IgM stored in the yolk sac in <italic>D. rerio</italic> embryos is also able to retain the capability to bind antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004498-Bly1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004498-Sin1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004498-Takemura1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004498-Kanlis1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. When the macrophages occur later in the embryos, C3 and Bf may also function in opsonizing the pathogenic cells for phagocytosis.</p><p>It is of note that after the secondary immunization, both C3 and Bf contents are significantly elevated in the mother and offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004498-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). Similarly, the hemolytic activities are also markedly enhanced in the mother and offspring following the secondary immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004498-g002"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>). These suggest that repeated maternal immunizations are able to strengthen the maternal immunity of the offspring, which can be potentially applied to protect fish too young to mount an immune response of their own. Additional studies will be required, however, to determine if this transferred immunity can be maintained for an extended period of time.</p><p>To summarize, we have shown for the first time that the <italic>in vivo</italic> protection of zebrafish embryos against <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> can be achieved by the maternally-transferred immunity of the complement system operating via the AP. As the maternal transfer of complement components to piscine offspring appears widespread, the complement-mediated maternal immunity may be a general route for protecting fish embryos and larvae from pathogenic attacks. It will be of interest in the future to study if the maternal IgM transferred can aid activation of the AP in the developing fish embryos.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents and solutions</title><p>Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), ethyleneglycol-bis (B-aminoethyl ether)-N, N, N&#x02032;-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), gelatin, <italic>O</italic>-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD), 3-aminobenzoic acid methyl ester (MS222), dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma (USA).
