Because matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been shown to be involved with angiogenesis, the expression of MMPs and their inhibitors was determined.</p><p><bold>Methods.</bold> Chronic renal insufficiency was created by subtotal renal infarction and 28 days later, arteriovenous PTFE grafts were placed bilaterally from the carotid artery to the jugular vein. Autologous blood outgrowth endothelial cells labeled with <italic>Lac Z</italic> were transplanted to the adventitia of the vein-to-graft anastomosis using polyglycolic acid scaffolding and scaffolding only to other side (control). Animals were killed 14 days later and vessels were explanted from the vein-to-graft anastomosis of both sides and underwent immunohistochemical analysis, western blotting and zymography for HIF-1&#x003b1;, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. BOEC were also made hypoxic and normoxic for 12, 24 and 48 h to determine protein expression for MMPs and TIMPs.</p><p><bold>Results.</bold> Under hypoxia, BOEC significantly increased the expression of pro MMP-2 by 12 h and TIMP-2 by 24 h when compared to normoxic cells (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Transplantation of BOEC resulted in a significant decrease in both HIF-1&#x003b1; and intima-to-media ratio with a significant increase in both pro and active MMP-9 when compared to control vessels (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). MMP-9 activity was localized to the neointima of the transplanted vessels by immunohistochemistry. There was increased CD31 density with engraftment of BOEC cells into the neointima of both the transplanted vessels compared to controls (<italic>P</italic> = NS).</p><p><bold>Conclusion.</bold> Transplantation of BOEC resulted in a significant decrease in intimal hyperplasia and HIF-1&#x003b1; with a significant increase in both pro and active MMP-9 that was localized to the neointima of transplanted vessels. The increase in MMP-9 offers a possible mechanism for angiogenesis and the reduced intima-to-media ratio. Furthermore, we observed that BOEC had homed to the neointima of the contralateral vessels that had increased levels of HIF-1&#x003b1;, suggesting that hypoxia may be an important stimulus for BOEC migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>blood outgrowth endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>haemodialysis graft failure</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>restenosis</kwd><kwd>vascular biology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the United States, over half of the patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis require polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts for vascular access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The patency of PTFE haemodialysis grafts has been reported to be 50% at 1 year and 25% at 2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Data suggest that haemodialysis vascular access graft failure results primarily from venous stenosis formation caused by intimal hyperplasia and subsequent thrombosis at the vein-to-graft anastomosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The intimal hyperplasia is composed of proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells with accompanying matrix deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. In patients with failed grafts, angiogenesis has been shown to occur within the neointima and adventitia along with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]. These observations from clinical specimens suggest that angiogenesis plays an important role in haemodialysis vascular access graft failure; however, the temporal sequence and exact nature of its relationship to intimal hyperplasia formation remains unclear.</p><p>Hypoxia is a fundamental stimulus for angiogenesis. It mediates gene expression of several important angiogenic factors through increased expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1&#x003b1;) including vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGF-R1), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. A recent study from our laboratory showed that there was significantly increased expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; in tissue removed from the venous stenosis when compared to control veins in a porcine model of chronic renal insufficiency with arteriovenous PTFE haemodialysis grafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Moreover, in clinical specimens removed from patients with PTFE haemodialysis grafts, there was significantly increased expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; when compared to control veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Finally, there have been several studies in experimental animal models of atherosclerosis and arterial restenosis that have showed that there is increased hypoxia (HIF-1&#x003b1;) associated with the pathologic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Taken collectively, these data suggest a role for hypoxia (HIF-1&#x003b1;) in haemodialysis graft failure and alleviating hypoxia may help reduce intimal hyperplasia.</p><p>MMPs, specifically MMP-2 and MMP-9, and their endogenous inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), play a key role in haemodia- lysis graft failure, vein graft remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated early up-regulation of MMP-2, in a porcine model of haemodialysis vascular access graft failure that corresponded with increased cell migration from the adventitia to the media and intima leading to venous stenosis formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Reduced neointimal formation has been observed in experimental animal models with the use of non-specific MMP-2 and MMP-9 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. We have shown that there is increased MMP-2 activity at the vein-to-graft anastomosis with subsequent increased expression of VEGF-R1 and TIMP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent laboratory study showed that in clinical specimens removed from patients with PTFE haemodialysis grafts, there was a significant increase in the expression of pro MMP-2, pro MMP-9 and TIMP-1 when compared to control veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. In aggregate, these studies suggest a prominent role of MMPs in haemodialysis graft failure.</p><p>A recent study showed that in patients with end-stage renal disease, there is an imbalance between endothelial and smooth muscle progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. It is hypothesized that this imbalance may explain the increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) are a subset of circulating progenitor cells that possess an endothelial cell phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. They have been shown to have potential therapeutic effects in experimental animal models of restenosis after angioplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>] and neovascularization through MMP activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. BOEC may be used to increase neovascularization by angiogenesis and thus reduce hypoxia. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of hypoxia on BOEC and the production of MMPs and their inhibitors. Next, we determined whether transplanting BOEC to the adventitia of PTFE haemodialysis grafts would reduce venous stenosis formation and hypoxia by increasing angiogenesis in a porcine model with chronic renal insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Because haemodialysis grafts are used in patients with advanced renal failure and the regulation of the targeted cytokines may be markedly different in the uraemic milieu, we performed these studies using a porcine model of renal insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. The expression of HIF-1&#x003b1;, MMP and TIMPs at the vein-to-graft anastomosis with immunohistochemical analysis was performed. Finally, luminal vessel area and blood flow were evaluated non-invasively by the use of magnetic resonance imaging and phase contrast magnetic resonance angiography (MRI/PC MRA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Method and materials</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>BOEC were made either hypoxic or normoxic for 12, 24 and 48 h, and the production of HIF-1&#x003b1;, MMPs and TIMPs was determined. Seven castrated juvenile male pigs (40&#x02013;50 kg, domestic swine, Larson Products, Sargeant, MN, USA) with chronic renal insufficiency induced by subtotal renal infarction were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. In these animals, autologous BOEC were transplanted to the adventitia of the vein-to-graft anastomosis and the subsequent effect on vessel remodeling was examined in seven pigs with bilateral arteriovenous PTFE grafts. Prior to transplantation, autologous BOEC were stably transduced with a retrovirus carrying <italic>Lac Z</italic> for <italic>in vivo</italic> localization. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, BOEC were seeded onto nanopore-sized scaffolding and wrapped around the adventitia of the vein-to-graft anastomosis at the time of graft placement, in contradistinction to the contralateral side that received only nanopore-sized scaffolding (control). Animals were subsequently followed for 14 days following graft placement. Luminal vessel area and graft patency were determined serially in each animal at Day 7, and Day 14 after graft placement using MRI and phase contrast MRA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Animals were sacrificed at Day 14 and tissue specimens from the vein-to-graft anastomosis of the control and BOEC-transplanted veins were carefully examined to determine five aspects of graft pathology and pathophysiology: (1) relative levels of HIF-1&#x003b1;, MMP and TIMP expression; (2) identifying the location and ascertaining the quantity of BOEC engraftment; (3) angiogenesis using a semi-quantitative scoring method; (4) determination of the quantity of neointima formation; and (5) luminal vessel area and blood flow by non-invasive imaging using MRI. One animal was used for the three-dimensional microscopic computed tomographic analysis.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Placement of polytetrafluoroethylene haemodialysis graft and representative MRI and PC MRA of venous stenoses.

To induce additional anaesthesia, an intravenous (IV) fluid line was placed in the ear vein for the delivery of zolazepam hydrochloride (5 mg/kg) which was also given as needed. During the procedure, the animals were intubated and placed on a positive-pressure ventilator delivering oxygen (3&#x02013;5 mL/kg) and isoflurane (1&#x02013;3%).

BOEC were isolated and expanded <italic>ex vivo</italic> as previously described, with some modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences Corporation, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Red blood cells were lysed using a buffer containing 0.1 mM of EDTA, 10 mM of KHCO<sub>3</sub> and 150 mM of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. Next, mononuclear cells were washed with MCDB 131 medium (GIBCO Industries, Inc., Langley, OK, USA) supplemented with hydrocortisone (1 &#x003bc;g/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), cyclic-AMP (0.5 mM, EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), amphotericin B (0.25 &#x003bc;g/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) and VEGF (10 ng/mL, R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Mononuclear cells were plated at a density of &#x0223c;6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well on six-well plates coated with rat tail Collagen type I (R&#x00026;D Systems) in endothelial growth medium-2 (EGM-2, Cambrex Corp., Rutherford, NJ, USA).</p><p>The cell culture was maintained at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 20% O<sub>2</sub>. After 2 days, the media was changed and the non-adherent cells were removed. After satisfactory initial growth, the media was subsequently changed every 2&#x02013;3 days. Between Days 15 and 18, colonies of cells appeared that exhibited typical endothelial morphology including a cobblestone pattern. Colonies were passaged and expanded for an additional 2 weeks. The adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization for transplantation.</p><p>The late outgrowth BOEC were characterized by a number of methods including endocytosis of acetylated low-density lipoprotein (acLDL) and expression of endothelial markers including VEGF-R2, von Willebrand factor (vWF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), caveolin-1 and CD-31. For uptake of acLDL, cells were incubated with acLDL (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at a concentration of 10 &#x003bc;g/mL in EGM-2 for 4 h. Cells were washed with PBS and examined using fluorescent confocal microscopy at an absorption wavelength of 555 nm (acLDL).</p><p>Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to determine the expression of endothelial markers as follows. Briefly, cells were plated in Lab-TEK chamber slides and cultured at 37&#x000b0;C under normal culture conditions for 48 h or until cells were nearly confluent. Media was removed and cells were washed in warm PBS and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C for detection of extracellular antigen. For detection of intracellular antigens, cells were washed in cold methanol at 20&#x000b0;C for 15 min. Next, cells were blocked with a solution of 5% normal goat serum (NGS), 5% glycerol in PBS for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Tissue was incubated with a primary antibody suspended in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Triton 0.1% for 1 h at RT. After incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS, followed by incubation with secondary antibody suspended in Tris buffered saline, with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 0.1% BSA. Cells were washed three times with PBS, followed by addition of mounting media containing DAPI (VECTA shield) and examined by conventional and confocal fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>The following antibodies were used: CD31 (Antigenix, Huntington Station, NY, USA, APG311, 1:100), CD14 (Antigenix, APG140, 1:10), CD45 (Antigenix, APG450-F, 1:10), &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA, USA, RB-9010, 1:100), e-NOS/NOS type III (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA, USA, clone 3, 610296, 1:200) and caveolin (BD Transduction Laboratories, 610059, 1:200).

In the present study, we investigated the role of hypoxia on protein production by BOEC and showed that under hypoxic conditions, BOEC increased the production of both pro MMP-2 by 12 h and TIMP-2 by 24 h when compared to normoxic conditions. Increased up regulation of TIMP-2 has been shown to decrease cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated increased expression of active MMP-9, by endothelial cells in response to inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>], oscillatory shear stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], by smooth muscle cells in response to cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>] and constitutively by inflammatory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</p><p>Multiple investigators have shown that circulating bone marrow-derived progenitor cells functionally contribute to angiogenesis during hypoxic pathology such as limb ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>] and myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. However, few investigators have targeted the adventitia directly. Targeting the adventitia is technically easier because BOEC can be transplanted to the site of injury without significant washout of cells, as can occur with intraluminal delivery. This technique has many benefits and can be expanded to other experimental vascular injury models such as vein bypass grafts used as arterial conduits, arterial restenosis after angioplasty and stent placement, and atherosclerosis in which the adventitia has been implicated in neointima formation. Transplantation of BOEC was performed by a unique method to promote engraftment of the progenitor cells by using biodegradable nanopore scaffolding wrapped around the adventitia of the vein-to-graft anastomosis at the time of graft placement resulting in a significant decrease in HIF-1&#x003b1; in the transplanted vessels when compared to control vessels.</p><p>The changes in protein expression in BOEC-transplanted vessels suggest several potential mechanisms by which BOEC may have promoted favorable venous remodeling. A significant increase in the expression of both pro and active MMP-9 was observed in the BOEC-transplanted vessels when compared to control vessels. Previous work from this laboratory in both a rat and a porcine model of haemodia- lysis grafts has shown no evidence of active MMP-9 in venous stenosis formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>] and in clinical specimens as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, no active MMP-9 was observed in venous stenotic tissue removed from animals with bilateral PTFE grafts with scaffolding and virus alone (no BOEC), suggesting that the presence of active MMP-9 was due to the transplantation of BOEC and not the scaffolding. Immunohistochemistry of the BOEC-transplanted vessel localized MMP-9 to the adventitia, media and neointima with the highest expression in the neointima. Given the low degree of incorporation of <italic>Lac Z-</italic>positive cells into the adventitia (&#x0003c;1%) and neointima (1&#x02013;2%), these findings suggest that BOEC may act through a paracrine mechanism to up-regulate the expression of MMP-9 and conversion to its active form.</p><p>It has been shown recently that adventitial fibroblasts will convert to myofibroblasts and migrate into the neointima contributing to venous stenosis formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been shown in fibroblasts harvested from the pulmonary artery, that hypoxia will stimulate the conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. It is possible that the BOEC may have acted on fibroblasts by decreasing the conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts through a MMP-2/TIMP-2-mediated pathway. Recently, it has been shown that increased TIMP-2 will decrease the ability of cells to invade in breast carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. Further experiments need to be performed to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>Active MMP-9 has been suggested to be the key mediator in the angiogenic switch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>], a term used to describe the transition from an avascular tumour to an angiogenic phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>]. MMP-9 has been shown to have a role in capillary branching and is required for adequate angiogenic revascularization of ischaemic tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Activation of MMP-9 increases the bioavailability of VEGF-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>] through direct cleavage of VEGF-A, releasing it from its matrix-binding motif and converting it to the soluble form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. In the present study, despite increased adventitial angiogenesis in the BOEC-transplanted vessels, no significant elevations in VEGF-A were seen. The VEGF-A detected by Western blot analysis is likely matrix-bound VEGF-A rather than the soluble form. Increased levels of active MMP-9 may have increased the conversion of VEGF-A from the matrix bound form to soluble form and therefore may not be detected. Alternatively, VEGF-A levels may have peaked at an earlier time point or other angiogenic factors may have been involved. These findings suggest a possible MMP-9-mediated mechanism by which BOEC promotes angiogenesis.</p><p>MMP-9 has been shown to play a role in aneurysmal formation through active secretion by smooth muscle cells and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. There was minimal inflammation observed at the vein-to-graft anastomosis with the exception of a rare macrophage seen in the adventitia adjacent to degraded scaffolding. No evidence of aneurysm formation was observed by MRI and there was no difference in medial thickness between the BOEC-transplanted vessel and the contralateral non-transplanted (control) vessels. This suggests that the changes seen in luminal vessel area were a result of a decrease in neointima formation but not from aneurysmal formation.</p><p>A trend toward increased angiogenesis was observed in BOEC-transplanted vessels with engraftment of <italic>Lac Z-</italic>positive BOEC into the adventitial microvasculature at 2 weeks. Additionally, <italic>Lac Z-</italic>positive BOEC were present in the neointima of both the ipsilateral transplanted BOEC vessels and contralateral non-transplanted (control) vessels, but no <italic>Lac Z-</italic>positive cells were visualized within the media. It is possible that migration of the <italic>Lac Z-</italic>positive BOEC into the media may have occurred prior to the 2 weeks. Alternatively, BOEC may have entered the systemic circulation via the vasa vasorum that communicates between the carotid artery and external jugular vein as demonstrated by the three-dimensional microscopic computed tomographic analysis.</p><p>The degree of BOEC engraftment in the neointima was greater in the non-transplanted vessels in which tissue levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; were also increased. A recent study demonstrated that HIF-1&#x003b1; up-regulated the expression of chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) that increased the adhesion, migration and homing of circulating progenitor cells to ischaemic tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. Interestingly, SDF-1 and MMP-9 have been shown to be involved in cell homing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. The results of the present study suggest that homing and engraftment of BOEC to neointima may be regulated through the elevated HIF-1&#x003b1; levels and hypoxia. However, other mechanisms mediated through SDF-1 may play a role in cell homing.</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides evidence to suggest that transplantation of BOEC to the adventitia of vein-to-graft anastomosis of haemodialysis grafts reduces venous stenosis formation. There was a decrease in HIF-1&#x003b1; suggesting alleviation of hypoxia and increased production of active and pro MMP-9 suggesting a possible mechanism by which BOEC may enhance angiogenesis. Additional experiments need to be performed to confirm these observations as well as the durability of these early results. Adventitial targeting has many potential therapeutic applications in cell-based gene therapy and can be expanded to other experimental vascular injury models including vein bypass grafts, arterial restenosis after angioplasty and stent placement, and atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Limitations</title><p>The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of adventitial delivery on haemodialysis graft remodeling. Examination of protein expression focused on basic factors known to play a role in angiogenesis and smooth muscle cell migration. However, there are many other potential cytokines and haemodynamic stimuli that contribute to these processes. The contribution of these to venous stenosis in our model is currently under investigation. Additionally, the current study was not designed to examine the effects of BOEC engraftment to the neointima as this was somewhat of an unexpected finding. Whether BOEC engraftment to the neointima promotes or attenuates the progression of neointima formation remains unclear and will need to be addressed in future studies. Finally, the durability of the observed results is unknown because of the short duration the animals were followed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr Eric Ritman for his help with the three-dimensional microscopic computed tomographic analysis.
