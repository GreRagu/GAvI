The beneficial activity of this plant has been linked to the compound nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and its various substituted derivatives. Recently, tetra-O-methyl NDGA or terameprocol (TMP) has been shown to inhibit the growth of certain tumor-derived cell lines and is now in clinical trials for the treatment of human cancer. In this report, we ask whether TMP also displays anti-inflammatory activity. TMP was tested for its ability to inhibit the LPS-induced production of inflammatory lipids and cytokines <italic>in vitro</italic>.

The Pima, Yaqui, Maricopa and Seri tribes have used various extracts and preparations from this plant to treat a wide variety of disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The leaves can be used in a bath for chicken pox or rheumatism, while a decoction made from the boiled leaves is used as a poultice for skin sores. Skin sores can also be treated with a powder made from dried leaves and stems. The leaves can be used to make a tea (chaparral tea) that is used to treat many disorders including cancer, venereal disease, tuberculosis, colds, and rheumatism. Consumption of high levels of <italic>L. tridentata </italic>can cause hepatic necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], although damage is temporary and reversed when <italic>L. tridentata </italic>is withdrawn from the diet.</p><p>The leaves and stems of <italic>L. tridentata </italic>contain high quantities of the phenolic compound nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lipophilic anti-oxidant that has been used as a preservative in fats and oils. Many of the medicinal effects of <italic>L. tridentata </italic>have also been attributed to the effects of this compound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. NDGA has been shown to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase activity <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and experiments have shown that it inhibits neutrophil production of LTB<sub>4 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], degranulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and the respiratory burst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. NDGA affects levels of intracellular calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], as well as exerting effects on mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and the Golgi complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. NDGA has been shown to exert anti-tumor effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and to block apoptosis induced either by tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] or CD95 ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p><italic>L. tridentata </italic>leaves also contain 3-O-methyl NDGA, with one methyoxl and three hydroxyl side chains rather than the four hydroxyl groups found on NDGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. 3-O-methyl NDGA has been shown to inhibit replication of a number of strains of HIV and prevent both basal transcription and Tat-regulated transactivation <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This effect arises from the ability of 3-O-methyl NDGA to interfere with the binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to the long terminal repeats of HIV, an effect that was not seen with NDGA itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Based on these results, eight distinct methylated forms of NDGA were tested for their effects on HIV Tat-mediated transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The results of this investigation revealed that tetra-O-methyl NDGA (also known as M4N or terameprocol (TMP)) displayed the highest level of anti-HIV activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. TMP has also been shown to block the replication of herpes simplex virus <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and to inhibit transcription from the early promoter P<sub>97 </sub>of human papillomavirus 16 in transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Both effects were again attributed to the ability of TMP to interfere with the binding of Sp1 to DNA. TMP has been found to arrest the growth of certain tumor-derived cell lines in the G<sub>2 </sub>phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting production of cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Experiments <italic>in vivo </italic>with mice, with a number of different tumor-derived and transformed cell lines, revealed a similar growth inhibitory effect resulting from decreased gene expression of both cdc2 and survivin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] leading to the suggestion that TMP may be useful in humans to treat cancer. Indeed, three clinical trials with TMP to treat human tumors have been completed and two more are now underway (Clinicaltrials.gov database, accessed 5/28/08).</p><p>In this report we have investigated a novel role for TMP; as an inhibitor of inflammation. We reasoned that TMP might have anti-inflammatory activity since many of the disorders for which <italic>L. tridentata </italic>is traditionally used contain an inflammatory component. In this manuscript we have focused on TMP's ability to inhibit production of inflammatory lipids and cytokines from macrophages and macrophage-like cells. The results of our experiments reveal inhibition of both cytokine and lipid mediator production and suggest that multiple molecular mechanisms underlie these effects. Overall, our data suggest that TMP may be useful in clinical situations to treat a variety of inflammatory disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and Media</title><p>RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's (DME) Medium with 4 mM L-glutamine, 4.5 g/L glucose, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate with 10% FCS. Most media and supplements were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO. FCS was obtained from Atlanta Biologicals, Atlanta, GA. For production of cell culture supernatants, 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well were plated in 24 well tissue culture plates in 1 ml culture media. Following treatment, supernatants were collected, centrifuged for 2 min at 8,000 rpm to remove debris, aliquoted and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Normal resident peritoneal macrophages were obtained from 8&#x02013;10 week old C57BL6/J mice (Charles River Laboratories, Inc. Wilmington, MA). Peritoneal lavage was performed with DME serum-free media. Following washing, the resulting cells were plated in DME with 10% FCS, incubated overnight, and then washed to remove non-adherent cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemicals and Biological Reagents</title><p>Unless otherwise indicated, reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO.

The PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>kit was purchased from Assay Designs and the IL-23p19 kit was purchased from eBioscience. All lipid mediator kits are competitive type immunoassays while the cytokine kits are direct capture assays. In each case, sample values were interpolated from standard curves. Optical density was determined using a PolarStar microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Durham, NC).</p></sec><sec><title>Cytokine arrays</title><p>For cytokine analysis, the RayBio Mouse Inflammation Antibody Array I was purchased from RayBiotech, Inc., Norcross, GA. According to manufacturer's instructions, the array membranes were incubated with blocking buffer followed by undiluted culture supernatants for 1.5 h. Then, the membranes were washed, incubated with biotin-conjugated Abs for 1.5 h and HRP-conjugated strepavidin for 2 h. The membranes were next incubated in detection buffer and exposed to X-ray film. Finally, scans of the X-ray films were analyzed with Photoshop (Adobe) to determine spot density.</p></sec><sec><title>Intraperitoneal challenge with LPS</title><p>Animal experiments were carried out in accord with approved IACUC protocol. Each group of experimental animals consisted of 5, 6&#x02013;8 week old, 15&#x02013;16 g C57BL6/J mice (Charles River). The groups received i.p. injections of either PBS, hydroxypropyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin with PEG 300 (CPE) vehicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], 20 &#x003bc;g of LPS in CPE vehicle, 1 mg of TMP in CPE vehicle, or 20 &#x003bc;g of LPS and 1 mg TMP in vehicle. CPE vehicle and TMP/CPE vehicle injections were administered 1 h prior to LPS or PBS injections. Injection volumes were 100 &#x003bc;l for TMP and vehicle and 200 &#x003bc;l for LPS and PBS. The mice were monitored for 3 hours, sacrificed, and blood collected by cardiac puncture. Serum was separated and levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, PGE<sub>2</sub>, and MCP-1 determined by ELISA.</p></sec><sec><title>Collection of peritoneal macrophages</title><p>Macrophages were collected by peritoneal lavage from 6&#x02013;8 week old C57BL6/J mice (Charles River).</p><p>After collection the cells were centrifuged, counted and plated at 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>per well in 24 well tissue culture plates. The cells were allowed to adhere for 2&#x02013;4 hr, washed to remove non-adherent cells and then treated as described within 24 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative RT-PCR assays</title><p>Total RNA of treated and untreated cells was extracted using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's specifications. Residual genomic DNA was eliminated by using on-column DNase digestion with the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) and resulting extracts were resuspended in nuclease free water. Total amount and purity of RNA was determined using a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Total RNA (1 &#x003bc;g) was denatured and reverse transcription was performed with the Improm ll reverse transcription kit (Promega, Madison, WI) in a reaction mix containing random hexamers as primers (50 ng/&#x003bc;l) for 60 min at 42&#x000b0;C. The iQTM SYBR Green supermix kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA), was used for Real-time PCR analysis, cDNA was amplified using primers specific for murine GAPDH, TNF-&#x003b1;, MCP-1, RANTES and COX-2.

All primer pairs were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA. Cycling conditions for all PCRs are available upon request.</p><p>PCR was performed in 96 well plates (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). Samples were amplified for a total of 50 cycles, followed by a meltcurve analysis to ensure the specificity of reactions. To generate a standard curve, total RNA was isolated from the cells and 300&#x02013;600 bp fragments of the gene of interest were amplified by RT-PCR using cognate primer sets. PCR fragments were gel purified, quantified and the copy number was calculated. Serial ten fold dilutions were prepared for use as templates to generate standard curves. All samples were normalized to amplified murine GAPDH. GAPDH control was analyzed per plate of experimental genes to avoid plate-to-plate variation. Final RT-PCR data is expressed as the ratio of copy numbers of experimental gene per 10<sup>3 </sup>copies of GAPDH for samples performed in duplicates.</p></sec><sec><title>Peroxidase Assay for the measurement of COX-2 Activity</title><p>Inhibition of the peroxidase activity of purified COX-2 enzyme was measured using a modified chromogenic assay, described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], in which N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) was utilized to measure the oxidation of PGG<sub>2 </sub>to PGH<sub>2</sub>. Briefly, approximately 100 U/ml of ovine COX-2 (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI) was mixed with an assay buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 &#x003bc;M bovine hemin and the inhibitor TMP. This mixture was incubated in a temperature controlled 1 cm glass cuvette at 25&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes to allow for enzyme and inhibitor equilibration. The peroxidase activity of the COX-2 enzyme was initiated by adding 100 &#x003bc;M arachidonic acid. TMPD (170 &#x003bc;M final) was added at the same time as the arachidonic acid and the reaction was monitored for six minutes using a Shimadzu UV-2401PC kinetic reading spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 611 nm. Absorbance was recorded at one second intervals using UV probe software (Shimadzu). After three minutes hydrogen peroxide was added to a final concentration of 70 &#x003bc;M to further catalyze the peroxidase reaction and the kinetic reading was continued for an additional three minutes. Control reactions were analyzed without inhibitor or without enzyme for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Cell monolayers were washed twice with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mM leupeptin, 0.5% SDS), and collected by scraping. The protein concentration for each sample lysate was determined using the Pierce BCA system (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal protein samples (15 to 30 &#x003bc;g) were loaded on 8% Tris-Glycine gels and subjected to electrophoresis using the Novex Mini-Cell System (Invitrogen). Following transfer, blocking and probing, bands were visualized using the SuperSignal Chemiluminescent system (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

The following morning, the cells were washed 2&#x000d7; with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), allowed to recover for an additional 2 h, and washed again prior to treatment. At indicated time points, 275 &#x003bc;l aliquots of media were removed from the wells and centrifuged to remove debris. 200 &#x003bc;l of the supernatant was removed for scintillation counting (LS 5801, Beckman, Fullerton, CA) and total [<sup>3</sup>H]AA-release was calculated by multiplying by a factor of 2. Each point was performed in triplicate and maximum radiolabel incorporation was determined by lysing untreated controls with 0.01% SDS and counting the total volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Influenza A virus propagation</title><p>Influenza A/PR/8/34 (VR-1469) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VI) and propagated in MDCK Cells (ATCC CCL-34).

Viral supernatants were harvested at 36 to 48 h, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and supplemented with BSA to a final concentration of 0.5%. Aliquots were frozen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Titers of influenza A virus were determined by plaque assay using MDCK cells. Briefly, 200 &#x003bc;l of serially diluted virus in VGM was inoculated onto confluent MDCK cells in 24-well plates. After a 30 min absorption period, 0.8 ml of overlay was added (0.6% Tragacanth in VGM). After 48 h of incubation the overlay was removed, the cells washed with cold PBS, fixed with cold acetone:methanol (1:1), and stained with crystal violet.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with PRISM<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA).

Briefly, cells were seeded in triplicate at a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>cells/well in 96 well plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Treatments were then performed and the plates processed according to manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescence intensity of CyQUANT GR dye, which is proportional to cellular DNA content, was then measured using the PolarStar microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Durham, NC).</p></sec><sec><title>Assay for apoptosis</title><p>An assay for active caspase-3 (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor MI, #10009135) was used to monitor the apoptosis-inducing activity of TMP.

Then, according to the manufacturer's instructions, the medium was removed, cells washed and lysis buffer added. A substrate for active caspase 3 (N-Ac-DEVD-N-MC-R110) was then added which, when cleaved by caspase 3, generates a fluorescent product with an emission maximum of 535 nm. Positive and negative controls were supplied by the manufacturer.

These cells have been used extensively as a model for prostaglandin production by primary macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, we found that treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml of LPS induced robust PGE<sub>2 </sub>production. PGE<sub>2 </sub>was first detected 4&#x02013;6 h after treatment with LPS began, and levels continued to rise during the remainder of the treatment period.

TMP's ability to inhibit the production of different prostaglandins, and to inhibit the production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>induced by different agonists, suggested that TMP was likely acting on a common, downstream element of the prostaglandin biosynthetic pathway, such as cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2 </sub>(cPLA<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] or COX-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, we found that TMP failed to inhibit the LPS-induced release of [<sup>3</sup>H]-arachidonic acid from prelabeled cells. In fact, [<sup>3</sup>H]-arachidonic acid release was actually enhanced by TMP. These results are consistent with TMP exerting a block in arachidonic acid metabolism downstream from cPLA<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, a series of experiments was performed to examine the effects of TMP on the expression and activity of COX-2. Initially, we examined the effects of TMP on the expression of COX-2 mRNA. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, we found that TMP reduced the LPS-induced expression of COX-2 mRNA, and a deficit of approximately 40% was evident after a 16 h treatment with LPS. However, the significance of this finding is unclear. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, we found that TMP caused only an approximate 20% reduction in COX-2 protein expression under the same conditions. Finally, we also tested whether TMP could directly inhibit the enzymatic activity of COX-2. An assay was established in which the activity of purified ovine COX-2, alone or in the presence of inhibitors, could be measured spectrophotometrically. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, we found that the activity of COX-2 was inhibited by 40&#x02013;50% in the presence of 25 &#x003bc;M TMP while inhibition of COX-2 activity was essentially complete in the presence 50 &#x003bc;M TMP. The level of inhibition of COX-2 activity by 50 &#x003bc;M TMP was comparable to that observed in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;M NS-398, a well characterized inhibitor of COX-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The effects of TMP on expression and activity of COX-2</bold>.

For purposes of discussion we have divided these into two groups. One group of cytokines and chemokines was induced to high levels, with mean pixel densities within 75% of the positive controls included with the array kit. The coordinates on the array of these cytokines and chemokines are enclosed by solid ellipses in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. Included in this group are RANTES (A7/8), TNF-&#x003b1; (G7/8), IL-6 (H3/4), MCP-1 (H5/6), MIP-1&#x003b1; (K5/6), and G-CSF (L1/2). A second set of cytokines, including; GM-CSF (A3/4), IL-1&#x003b1; (C3/4), M-CSF (I5/6), and IL-12p40p70 (K3/4) was induced to a lesser degree. The coordinates of these cytokines are enclosed by dashed ellipses in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. Mean pixel densities for cytokines in this group were typically between 20&#x02013;25% above negative controls. Finally, we found that LPS also triggered an increase in the production of TIMP-1 (E7/8) and sTNF R2 (I7/8).</p><p>As shown in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, we found that TMP exerted a range of effects on LPS-induced cytokine production. Among the cytokines normally induced by LPS to high levels; TMP produced two levels of suppression. Very slight suppression was noted for two cytokines, IL-6 (11%) and MIP-1&#x003b1; (8%), while substantially higher levels of suppression were noted for RANTES (29%), G-CSF (36%), TNF-&#x003b1; (43%), and MCP-1 (58%). TMP also exerted a range of effects on the cytokines produced at lower levels. Production of GM-CSF was blocked completely, while slight suppression was noted for IL-1&#x003b1; (16%). In contrast, secretion of M-CSF was increased to a small degree (7%), and that of IL-12p40p70 was increased substantially (141%). TMP also inhibited production of TIMP-1 (36%) and sTNF R2 (30%).</p><p>Since antibody filter arrays are typically semi-quantitative, we sought to confirm several of the effects we had noted using specific cytokine ELISAs. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, suppression of TNF-&#x003b1; production measured by ELISA (42%) very closely matched the level of suppression observed on the array (43%). The suppressive effects of TMP were also very similar for MCP-1 production, when measured by ELISA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) (67%) or by the array (58%). On the other hand, ELISA did not confirm the inhibition of RANTES production (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) noted on the array. At present, the reason for this discrepancy is unclear. Finally, we also used ELISA to investigate the TMP-dependent increase in IL-12p40p70. The increase in IL12p40p70 noted on the array, in the absence of an increase in IL-12p70 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>), suggests that TMP enhances the LPS-dependent production of p40 monomers or homodimers. Alternatively, it is also possible that this represents production of IL-23 since p40 is also a component of IL-23. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, an ELISA specific for IL-12p40 confirmed the finding from the array. However, an ELISA specific for IL-23 (n = 3, 10 pg/ml sensitivity) did not detect any of this cytokine (data not shown).

These results are consistent with those of early studies which showed that NDGA, the parent compound of TMP, could suppress prostaglandin production by primary murine macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Our results suggested that TMP may indeed be useful clinically to treat a number of disorders and, therefore, we investigated the mechanism underlying this activity. Because prostaglandin production was suppressed regardless of the inducing agent (LPS, phorbol ester, or influenza virus), we reasoned that it was unlikely that TMP was interfering with signals from specific receptors such as TLR-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Therefore we focused our investigation on common, downstream elements in the prostaglandin pathway such as cPLA<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and COX-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. TMP did not inhibit the LPS-induced release of [<sup>3</sup>H]-arachidonic acid, which suggested that it was not affecting the activity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>, and therefore we focused our efforts on COX-2. Our experiments revealed a number of effects of TMP on COX-2, including; a 40% reduction in COX-2 mRNA, a 20% reduction in COX-2 protein, and inhibition of COX-2 enzymatic activity. The effects of TMP on the expression of COX-2 mRNA were not entirely surprising since the 5' flanking region of the COX-2 gene has 3 Sp1 binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and TMP is known to inhibit Sp1 binding to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Exactly how TMP's effect on the expression of COX-2 mRNA ultimately impacts prostaglandin production is not clear. The decrease in COX-2 mRNA resulted in only a modest decrease in COX-2 protein making it unlikely that this effect of TMP is a major determinant of its ability to suppress prostaglandin production. Rather, it seems that a direct inhibitory effect of TMP on COX-2 enzymatic activity is primarily responsible for the suppression of prostaglandin synthesis. This result was unexpected. Although NDGA, the parent compound of TMP, is widely known as an inhibitor of lipoxygenases, direct inhibition of COX-2 activity by NDGA appears not to have been described. In addition, lipoxygenase inhibition by NDGA is thought to depend on its anti-oxidant activity, but this is greatly reduced in TMP, which carries methyl rather than hydroxyl groups. Clearly, more studies need to be performed to examine the interaction between COX-2 and TMP and elucidate the mechanism of inhibition.</p><p>Our results suggest that TMP is a potent, direct inhibitor of COX-2 activity, and the magnitude of this effect may be sufficient to fully account for the suppression of prostaglandin production by TMP in LPS-stimulated cells. However, since the yield of the various prostaglandins tested was not affected equally by a fixed concentration of TMP, it is conceivable that TMP may also affect the activity of one or more of the prostaglandin synthases downstream from COX-2. Further research will be required to evaluate this possibility.</p><p>In this study we also addressed the effects of TMP on the LPS-induced production of cytokines and chemokines by RAW 264.7 cells. The antibody array we used revealed increases in the production of 10 cytokines or chemokines following treatment with LPS. We also measured increased levels of TIMP-1 and sTNF R2 in culture supernatants. Among these molecules, TMP failed to suppress production of the chemokine MIP-1&#x003b1;, or the cytokines IL-6, IL-1&#x003b1;, and M-CSF. On the other hand, suppression was noted for the chemokine MCP-1, and for the cytokines TNF-&#x003b1;, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. We also noted suppression of production of TIMP-1 and sTNF R2. In contrast to the results obtained for COX-2, we found a strong correlation between the levels of cytokine mRNAs and their respective protein products. TMP suppressed the accumulation of TNF-&#x003b1; and MCP-1 mRNA and protein to similar extents, while it had no effect on the accumulation of RANTES mRNA or protein. The suppression of cytokine mRNA accumulation by TMP in LPS-stimulated cells may be determined by its ability to inhibit binding of the Sp1 transcription factor to DNA. Experiments with monocytic cell lines have shown that Sp1 binding sites are required for the LPS-induced activation of the TNF-&#x003b1; promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], whereas they are completely dispensable for activation of the RANTES promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Although a direct effect of TMP on cytokine gene transcription could account for the reduced accumulation of mRNAs, other, post-transcriptional mechanisms cannot be excluded. For example, TNF-&#x003b1; production can be regulated at the level of mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], as well as by protease cleavage of the TNF-&#x003b1; precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and either of these might be affected by TMP. Interestingly, if TMP inhibited the expression or activity of the TNF-&#x003b1; converting enzyme, it would be expected to reduce the levels of both secreted TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and sTNF R2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], as we observed in our experiments. Additional investigation will be required to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which TMP suppresses the production of various cytokines including its potential effects on other transcription factors linked to inflammation, such as NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>Overall, for testing the effects of TMP on cytokine production, the RAW 264.7 cell line proved to be an excellent model, although we did find one major difference in its response to LPS compared to that of peritoneal macrophages. Treatment with TMP caused an increase in the expression of IL-12/23 p40 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, but this effect was not seen with LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. In peritoneal macrophages, we observed a response that was consistent with the effects of TMP on other cytokines; namely inhibition of expression. Why the LPS-dependent expression of IL-12/23 p40 is increased by TMP in RAW 264.7 cells is not clear. Apparently, the pathway(s) that regulate the expression of IL-12p40 are altered in RAW 264.7 cells so that TMP causes an enhancing effect.</p><p>Our experiments also revealed that TMP inhibited the growth of RAW 264.7 cells. Based on the ability of TMP to inhibit the growth of certain tumor-derived cell lines, and its effects on Sp1, its effect on the growth of RAW 264.7 cells was not surprising. We did not detect any apoptosis and the growth inhibitory effect disappeared when the TMP was withdrawn, indicating that TMP is not damaging towards RAW 264.7 cells and is likely causing reversible, cell cycle arrest. In the future it will be interesting to determine whether there is a link between the growth inhibitory effects of TMP and the ability of TMP to inhibit production of cytokines and inflammatory lipids in RAW 264.7 cells. However, since peritoneal macrophages do not grow <italic>in vitro</italic>, we can conclude that growth inhibition is not a prerequisite for TMP to exert its anti-inflammatory effects.</p><p>Based on the ability of TMP to inhibit cytokine and lipid mediator production <italic>in vitro</italic>, we tested whether TMP could exert these effects <italic>in vivo</italic>. We used a mouse model of endotoxemia in which a sublethal dose of LPS is administered <italic>i.p. </italic>resulting in transient increases in the serum levels of several cytokines. Increased cytokine levels are evident within one hour; continue to rise for 2&#x02013;3 hrs, then return to pretreatment levels 1&#x02013;2 hrs later. The response to LPS under these circumstances is complex and cytokine production involves many cell types from different organs and tissues. LPS is transported from the peritoneum to the liver via the portal vein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] where both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells respond by producing TNF and other cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Likewise, spleen, brain and bone marrow cells also produce cytokines following <italic>i.p. </italic>exposure to LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Whether these cells are responding directly to the LPS or to the cascade of cytokines produced by the liver is not entirely clear. Pharmacokinetic experiments in mice indicate that TMP also spreads rapidly through the body following <italic>i.p. </italic>administration. Park, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] have shown that 4 hours after a single <italic>i.p. </italic>injection of TMP (2 mg) it can be readily detected in a variety of tissues and organs (liver, adipose tissue, brain, etc.) at &#x003bc;M concentrations comparable to those we utilized <italic>in vitro</italic>. TMP-mediated suppression of cytokine production <italic>in vivo </italic>may therefore be occurring at a variety of anatomical locations outside the peritoneal cavity and defining these sites will be the focus of future investigations.</p><p>It has been over two decades since TNF-&#x003b1; was identified as one of the major mediators of endotoxemia and cachexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Since then, TNF has been linked to a number of auto-immune and inflammatory disorders including; rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis, to name a few (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]). Although expensive and difficult to administer, TNF-&#x003b1; blockers such as Infliximab, Etanercept, or Adalimumab have proven to be clinically effective for the management of these disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The results of our experiments showed that TMP can reduce levels of TNF-&#x003b1; <italic>in vivo</italic>. While it is clear that many additional experiments remain to be performed, our results raise the possibility that TMP may be useful for treating inflammatory diseases that are mediated by TNF-&#x003b1;. Furthermore, the use of TMP may be advantageous over that of other TNF-&#x003b1; blockers because TMP also inhibits the production of other cytokines and inflammatory lipids. Elevated levels of MCP-1, for example, have been linked to psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], while production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>contributes to rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. In both of these diseases TMP might prove more effective than drugs that target only TNF-&#x003b1;.</p><p>In summary, we have examined the ability of TMP to inhibit the secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory lipids from activated macrophages. Our results show that TMP can inhibit production of both prostaglandins and several key inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, TMP could potentially be used as a treatment for a number of different inflammatory disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>&#x02022; TMP inhibited production of prostaglandins from LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and from murine peritoneal macrophages.</p><p>&#x02022; The ability of TMP to inhibit prostaglandin production was linked to effects on levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein and to inhibition of COX-2 enzymatic activity.</p><p>&#x02022; TMP inhibited production of several key inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by RAW 264.7 cells and murine peritoneal macrophages.</p><p>&#x02022; The ability of TMP to inhibit cytokine and chemokine production was correlated with effects on levels of cytokine and chemokine mRNA.</p><p>&#x02022; TMP reduced levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and MCP-1 in the serum of mice challenged <italic>i.p. </italic>with a sublethal dosage of LPS.</p><p>&#x02022; The ability of TMP to inhibit production of both protein and lipid mediators of inflammation suggests that it may have broad clinical application for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>TMP: terameprocol; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; TNF-&#x003b1;: tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;; COX-2: cyclo-oxygenase-2; ELISA; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; q-rt-PCR: quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; MCP-1: monocyte chemotactic protein-1; NDGA: nordihydroguaiaretic acid; HIV: human immunodeficiency virus; CPE: 20% hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin and 50% polyethylene glycol 300; PMA: phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Erimos Pharmaceuticals produces TMP and would stand to benefit financially if TMP was used clinically to treat inflammation.
