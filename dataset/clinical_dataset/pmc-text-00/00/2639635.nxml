The enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of inactive glycogen phosphorylase b (GPb), resulting in the formation of active glycogen phosphorylase a. We present a 9.9 &#x000c5; resolution structure of PhK heterotetramer (&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;&#x003b4;)<sub>4</sub> determined by cryo-electron microscopy single-particle reconstruction. The enzyme has a butterfly-like shape comprising two lobes&#x000a0;with 222 symmetry. This three-dimensional structure has allowed us to dock the catalytic &#x003b3; subunit to the PhK holoenzyme at a location that is toward the ends of the lobes. We have also determined the structure of PhK decorated with GPb at 18 &#x000c5; resolution, which shows the location of the substrate near the kinase subunit. The PhK preparation contained a number of smaller particles whose structure at 9.8 &#x000c5; resolution was consistent with&#x000a0;a proteolysed activated form of PhK that had lost the &#x003b1; subunits and possibly the &#x003b3; subunits.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PROTEINS</kwd><kwd>SIGNALING</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions are major control mechanisms in eukaryotic cells. Skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase (PhK) was the first protein kinase to be recognized by function and to be purified over five decades ago (<xref rid="bib13 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Fischer and Krebs, 1955; Krebs et&#x000a0;al., 1964</xref>). PhK is a key enzyme in the control of glycogenolysis. Intracellular glycogen stores are used primarily to maintain blood-glucose homeostasis during fasting and as a source of energy for muscle contraction. PhK integrates signals from different signal pathways&#x02014;hormonal messengers (adrenaline), neuronal stimuli (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), and metabolic signals (e.g., adenosine diphosphatase [ADP] levels)&#x02014;to produce rapid mobilization of glycogen stores. PhK phosphorylates inactive glycogen phosphorylase b (GPb) on a single serine, Ser14, converting it to active phosphorylase a (GPa). Active phosphorylase catalyzes the phosphorolysis of glycogen to release glucose-1-phosphate. All eukaryotic protein kinases share a common catalytic core, which catalyzes the transfer of the &#x003b3;-phosphate from a nucleoside triphosphate donor to the side-chain hydroxyl of a serine, threonine, or tyrosine in substrate proteins, but each kinase recognizes only specific substrates and each is regulated by a distinct mechanism.</p><p>PhK is one of the largest and most complex of the protein kinases (<xref rid="bib6 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Brushia and Walsh, 1999; Heilmeyer, 1991</xref>). It is composed of four types of subunit, with stoichiometry (&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;&#x003b4;)<sub>4</sub> and a total molecular weight (MW) of 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>. The &#x003b1; (138 kDa, 1237 amino acids) and &#x003b2; (125 kDa, 1092 amino acids) homologous subunits are regulatory inhibitory subunits. Autophosphorylation or phosphorylation of these subunits by cyclic adenosine-monophosphatase-dependent kinase in response to hormonal stimulation leads to activation of the kinase. ADP binds to the &#x003b2; subunit with high affinity and also stimulates activity. Neuronal stimulation is effected by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which bind to the intrinsic calmodulin (&#x003b4;) subunit (16.7 kDa, 148 amino acids), thus coupling muscle contraction with energy production. PhK differs from most other calmodulin-regulated enzymes in that the &#x003b4;-calmodulin subunit is tightly associated in the holoenzyme in the absence of calcium. The &#x003b3; subunit (44.7 kDa) is the catalytic subunit. It is composed of a kinase domain (residues 20&#x02013;276) and a regulatory calmodulin-binding autoinhibitory domain (residues 298&#x02013;396). PhK is one of several kinases that do not require phosphorylation on the kinase activation segment for activity. When isolated, the kinase domain is constitutively active. It has a glutamate in place of the more typical phosphorylatable serine, threonine, or tyrosine in the activation segment (<xref rid="bib25 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lowe et&#x000a0;al., 1997; Owen et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>). Hence, the role of the regulatory &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b4; subunits is to restrain, either directly or indirectly, the activity of the kinase domain until signals are received that relieve the inhibition.</p><p>Structural data are available for the kinase domain and for calmodulin, but little is known of the homologous &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits. Recent sequence comparisons have suggested that the N-terminal regions residues 1&#x02013;436 (&#x003b1; subunit) or residues 40&#x02013;477 (&#x003b2; subunit) share sequence similarities with family 15 glycosyl hydrolases (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Pallen, 2003</xref>), whereas the C-terminal region residues 1066&#x02013;1237 (&#x003b1; subunit) and 918&#x02013;1093 (&#x003b2; subunit) share similarities with the calcineurin B-like proteins (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Carriere et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>) that are composed of two pairs of EF hands and that might contribute to the regulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, a leucine zipper motif has been identified in the &#x003b1; subunit, but not the &#x003b2; subunit, for residues 833&#x02013;854 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Ayers et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The activation of PhK is complex, with several different layers of control. In vitro pH is a further regulator. Inactive PhK assayed in the presence of calcium exhibits low activity at pH 6.8. Activity is markedly increased at pH 8.2, but still requires the presence of calcium. Activation of PhK by phosphorylation or limited proteolysis results in an increase in activity at pH 6.8 but little change in activity at pH 8.2 (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Newsholme and Walsh, 1992</xref>).</p><p>In order to understand the structural basis of the mechanisms involved in control of PhK through protein-protein interactions and by phosphorylation, a structure of the whole enzyme is required. Intact PhK has been difficult to crystallize for X-ray studies, but it has proved amenable to single-particle analysis by electron microscopy. We previously determined the three-dimensional (3D) structure of PhK at 22 &#x000c5; resolution using negative stain electron microscopy and the random conical tilt method (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Venien-Bryan et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). The 222 symmetric structure shows a butterfly-like arrangement with two wing-like lobes connected by two oblique bridges. We also determined the structure of PhK decorated with GPb at 28 &#x000c5; resolution in the presence of activating Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> at pH 8.2 showing that GPb bound toward the end of the lobes. At the same time, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Nadeau et&#x000a0;al. (2002)</xref> compared the negatively stained structures of inactive PhK at pH 6.8 in the absence and presence of calcium, and showed that calcium promotes a redistribution of density throughout the lobe and bridge regions without perturbing the overall dimensions. This model has been further improved and elaborated in&#x000a0;subsequent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies at 25 &#x000c5; resolution and small angle X-ray scattering to detect calcium induced structural changes (<xref rid="bib31 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nadeau et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Priddy et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present the structure of calcium activated PhK at pH&#x000a0;8.2 at subnanometer resolution using frozen unstained specimens and cryo-EM. In the 3D model we located the &#x003b3; catalytic subunit (PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub> residues 1&#x02013;298), whose kinase domain structure has been solved by X-ray crystallography (<xref rid="bib25 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lowe et&#x000a0;al., 1997; Owen et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>). The high-resolution cryo-3D single-particle studies have been extended to produce a 3D model of the PhK/GPb complex. Visualization of this complex allows us to elaborate in greater detail on the interaction and contact between PhK and its substrate. Structures of glycogen phosphorylase in both its active and inactive state are known from X-ray studies (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barford and Johnson, 1989</xref>). We also present the structure of the activated proteolysed PhK, which might have a physiological role in apoptosis (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hilder et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Purification and Activity Measurements</title><p>SDS-PAGE electrophoresis of PhK after the last purification step showed four bands corresponding in molecular size to the four subunits of PhK and indicated pure enzyme had been isolated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A).</p><p>The PhK was shown to be functionally active at pH 8.2 in the presence of calcium against GPb substrate with k<sub>cat</sub> values of 134 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 97 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and K<sub>m</sub> 9.3 &#x003bc;M and 42 &#x003bc;M versus GPb and ATP substrates, respectively, as the variable substrate (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>A). PhK holoenzyme had approximately 2.2-fold higher k<sub>cat</sub> than the kinase domain PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub> with both GPb and ATP as the variable substrate. Values of K<sub>m</sub> for GPb were similar (9.2 &#x003bc;M and 8.5 &#x003bc;M, respectively). K<sub>m</sub> values for ATP showed a 2-fold difference between the PhK holoenzyme and PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub> (41.5 &#x003bc;M and 82.1 &#x003bc;M, respectively). The kinetic parameters suggest that the activity of the kinase, when incorporated into the holoenzyme, has slightly different properties that make it a more efficient enzyme.</p><p>Comparison between specific activities for the calcium-activated states of PhK at pH 8.2 (5.2 &#x003bc;mol/min/nmol) and at pH 6.8 (0.65 &#x003bc;mol/min/nmol) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>B) shows that the ratio for 6.8/8.2 is 0.125. This ratio is higher than the value of &#x0223c;0.05, which is usually accepted as indication for unmodified PhK (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Newsholme et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>). It has been shown that activation by proteolysis results in a pH 6.8/8.2 activity ratio between 0.2 and 0.9 (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Newsholme et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>). This is discussed further below.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>3D Reconstruction Volume of PhK by Cryo-EM at 9.9 &#x000c5; Resolution</title><p>PhK was prepared under conditions (pH 8.2 and in the presence of calcium) where it is known to be in the active conformation as indicated from the kinetic studies. PhK was imaged in cryoconditions. A range of recognizable particle shapes could be distinguished in the electron micrographs as illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B. The 3D structure was calculated with 18,123 defocus-corrected particles using SPIDER (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Frank et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A&#x02013;2E) and refined to 9.9 &#x000c5; resolution as assessed from the 0.5 Fourier-shell correlation (FSC) cut-off (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>F). The contour level for surface display was chosen so that it encloses a volume corresponding to the known molecular mass (1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> Da) as calculated with a protein partial specific volume of 0.84 Da/&#x000c5;<sup>3</sup>. A gallery of the class averages of PhK and the corresponding reprojections of the 3D map is shown in <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref> (available online).</p><p>The comparison with our previous model obtained from negatively stained PhK at 22 &#x000c5; resolution is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>. The overall shape of the 3D models (negatively stained and cryo) is the same, but the cryo-3D model shows a better-resolved structure, which has lost its smooth appearance and exhibits finer details. The dimensions of the overall structure are 270 &#x000d7; 225&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 160 &#x000c5;. The butterfly-like view (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A) shows that PhK is made of two opposing lobes that are held together by two short oblique cross bridges. The dimensions of the lobes in the projection are 225 &#x000c5; &#x000d7; 110 &#x000c5;, and the bridges are 55 &#x000c5; in length and 45 &#x000c5; in width. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2C show the chalice and the tetrad orientations. The hole inside the tetrad structure has a cross section of 35 &#x000d7; 85 &#x000c5;. The relative orientation of the lobes can be seen after a 90&#x000b0; rotation about the horizontal axis of the butterfly orientation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). The angle between the lobes is 65&#x000b0;, as observed previously (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Venien-Bryan et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The high-resolution (9.9 &#x000c5;; 18,123 particles) cryomodel of active PhK is consistent with the broad features noted in the lower-resolution (25 &#x000c5;; 4,878 particles) cryomodel of inactive PhK (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Nadeau et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), but there are two main differences. These concern the angle between the lobes and the nature of the bridges. These features have been described as the most variable in previous reconstructions (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Nadeau et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). The angle between the lobes observed here (65&#x000b0;) differs from the value (90&#x000b0;) noted by <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Nadeau et&#x000a0;al. (2005)</xref>. In previous negatively stained images, an angle of 68&#x000b0; had been noted which the authors conclude was a result of distortions induced by the stain. However in our present cryoimaging the enzyme has been preserved in the vitreous ice and there should be no distortions. In the present model we observe just two connecting bridges (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B), whereas Nadeau and colleagues reported that the two bridges resolved to four bridges with asymmetric connections to the two lobes. These differences between the two cryoimages give intriguing clues to the possible conformational changes that occur on activation of PhK that will be the subject of a future collaborative comparison.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Location of the &#x003b3; Subunit</title><p>We have raised polyclonal antibodies against the &#x003b3; kinase subunit peptide with the sequence (TAEEALAHPFFQQY residues 277&#x02013;290). Immunoblot assays of the binding of the anti-&#x003b3; antibody to denatured PhK show that these antibodies recognize the &#x003b3;&#x000a0;subunit (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A). <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et&#x000a0;al. (1997)</xref> used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to show that a similar antibody raised to the same epitope recognizes the intact holoenzyme. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B shows a gallery of negatively stained PhK labeled with antibody against the &#x003b3; subunit. The antibodies appear to bind at the internal side of the lobes. This result is consistent with the results of (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>) who observed a similar location with a monoclonal antibody directed against the same region of the &#x003b3; subunit. Examination of about 600 images showed that about 20% of the PhK particles had no antibody bound, about 60% had one antibody bound, 16% had two antibodies, and 3% had three antibodies. The reasons for these stochastic observations are not clear. It is possible that the dual labeling with antibodies prevents simultaneous binding of the antibody complexes on adjacent lobes of the PhK molecule or that the epitope (residues 277&#x02013;290) is not completely accessible for antibody binding. Occasionally PhK dimers or higher aggregates associated with the antibody were observed, but these were not numerous.</p><p>To determine more precisely the position of the &#x003b3; catalytic subunit, we fitted the crystal structure of PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub> (residues 1&#x02013;298) (<xref rid="bib25 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lowe et&#x000a0;al., 1997; Owen et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>) into the 9.9 &#x000c5; cryo-EM model using a rigid-body approach. Three different programs were used (see <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Data</xref>), and each gave the same location of the PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub> into the 3D model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). In this orientation of PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub> into the 3D EM model, we note that the epitope against which the antibodies were raised (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>D, in blue) is consistent with the position of the binding of the antibodies as seen in the negatively stained complexes.</p><p>The PhK &#x003b3; subunit catalytic domain has the classical bilobal protein kinase structure. A smaller N-terminal lobe (residues 14&#x02013;107), formed principally from &#x003b2; sheet, is connected to a larger C-terminal lobe (residues 110&#x02013;292), formed mainly from &#x003b1; helices. The two lobes are joined by a hinge region around residues Lys108 and Gly109. The atomic models of PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub> were converted to SPIDER format and filtered to a resolution comparable to the PhK 3D cryo-EM volume. The characteristic bilobal shape of PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub> is shown in two orientations: front and side views (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>D, middle). The N-terminal lobe of the PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub> is the upper part of the molecule and the C-terminal lobe is the lower part. The cleft between these two domains is highlighted with circle. The cleft is also highlighted with circle on the 3D model of PhK (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>D, left and far right). It appears that the bilobal structure with a definite cleft was a defining feature that guided all three programs for the modeling to ft PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub> into this characteristic feature of the 3D EM model. The programs were used without any manual prefitting of the PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub>.</p><p>The PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub> X-ray structure had been determined with&#x000a0;a substrate analog peptide bound. The substrate peptide is shown in red in the magnified view of the site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>D, left). This defines the catalytic site of the kinase and the site at which the substrate, glycogen phosphorylase, should be recognized. In the crystal structure of PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub> in complex with a substrate peptide, the kinase domain formed dimers across a two-fold crystallographic axis in a head-to-tail arrangement with part of the peptide substrate also involved in contacts across the two-fold axis (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lowe et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). However, in the fit of the domain to the PhK holoenzyme, the location toward the ends of the lobes indicates that the kinase domain is not involved in a homo-dimer interaction. This also implies that the association of PhK holoenzyme with GPb is unlikely to exploit the two-fold symmetry of the GPb dimer.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>3D Reconstruction Volume of PhK/GPb by Cryo-EM</title><p>The PhK/GPb complex was formed in solution before deposition on the electron microscope grid. Divalent cations Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> were included in the buffer, because these enhance the affinity of PhK for GPb by about 8-fold (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Xu et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>). Quantitative assessment of the affinity of the multivalent proteins PhK tetramer (MW&#x000a0;1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) and GPb dimer (MW 1.94 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) is not easy.

Although the work provided valuable comparative values, as the authors comment, because the ELISA assay requires immobilization of one of the pairs, the K<sub>d</sub> values do not necessarily reflect the K<sub>d</sub> for binding in solution. The concentrations used in preparing the PhK/GPb sample (PhK tetramer 2.22 mg/ml [1.71 &#x003bc;M] and GPb dimer 1.08 mg/ml [5.54 &#x003bc;M]) correspond to 1 PhK (&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;&#x003b4;):0.8 GPb dimer. Depending on the value of K<sub>d</sub>, saturation of PhK with GPb could have been between 1% and 80%. The appearance of the particles on the grids showed all particles with an increase in size, indicating that some were GPb bound, compared with the native PhK particles.</p><p>The 3D structure was calculated with 18,704 defocus-corrected particles and refined to 18 &#x000c5; resolution as estimated from the 0.5 FSC cut-off. The final reconstruction is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A. The threshold used to display the PhK/GPb model was chosen so as to give a compact particle with continuity that reflects the integrity of the particle as seen on the micrographs. The total number of particles used for the reconstruction of both models is similar (18,127 for the PhK and 18,704 for PhK/GPb), but for apo PhK, homogeneous particles were selected out of a total of 30,650 particles using the reference-free classification. Selection for PhK/GPb proved more difficult because of&#x000a0;the lower number of particles and because the particles appeared to be naturally less homogeneous possibly because of incomplete binding of GPb. The nonhomogeneity is reflected in the lower resolution of the reconstructed image. The dimension of the overall structure is 310 &#x000d7; 250 &#x000d7; 200 &#x000c5; and is greater than that of PhK alone (270 &#x000d7; 225 &#x000d7; 160 &#x000c5;). The dimensions of the lobes of the butterfly-like shape are 250 &#x000d7; 120 &#x000c5; showing a 25 &#x000c5; increase in length from PhK, with generally more density at the ends of the lobes. The bridges have about the same length as for the PhK alone.</p><p>A difference map was calculated to localize more precisely the additional density arising from GPb bound to PhK. The PhK map was first filtered to 18 &#x000c5;, the same resolution as for the 3D model PhK/GPb. Then the PhK and PhK/GPb maps were normalized and their difference computed. The extra density (shown in magenta in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C), presumably representing GPb, is located toward the end of each of the lobes of PhK. A possible manual fit of the atomic structure of the molecular mass of the 97 kDa GPb monomer (PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="2GPB">2GPB</ext-link>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 1990</xref>) into the additional density was performed. We positioned the GPb monomer so as to place Ser14, the site of phosphorylation, close to the position of &#x003b3;&#x000a0;subunit catalytic cleft. The location of GPb was subsequently adjusted using the docking program from CHIMERA (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Goddard, 2007</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>D). In the crystal structure of GPb, the N-terminal region (residues 11&#x02013;19) is mobile. Mobility around the site of phosphorylation in the native nonphosphorylated structure appears to be an important feature that allows the substrate to&#x000a0;be accommodated in the defined extended conformation demanded by the kinase catalytic site (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lowe et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). The proposed docking mode for GPb to the kinase domain of PhK assumes some flexibility in the N-terminal region.</p><p>The lower volume of density seen for GPb in the PhK/GPb complex compared with the volume of density for the GPb dimer derived from the X-ray model indicates that only one subunit of GPb is localized, as observed previously (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Venien-Bryan et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). The threshold chosen for the display of the difference map between PhK/GPb and PhK corresponds to&#x000a0;a molecular mass of 620 kDa per PhK tetramer or 155 kDa per PhK monomer. The molecular mass of GPb monomer is 97 kDa or 194 kDa per dimer. Thus the density is sufficient to account for more than one GPb monomer but not sufficient for a dimer. The use of substoichiometric ratios of PhK:GPb (1 PhK [&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;&#x003b4;] for 0.8 GPb dimers) could account for some low occupancy, but not the lack of the second subunit. If one subunit is firmly bound, then the other subunit must project into solution and is less well located and shows some flexibility. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>E shows a possible position of the GPb dimer in the 3D model PhK/GPb. The fit is very approximate and complicated by the heterogeneity of the sample. In this view, the two-fold axis of the GPb dimer is approximately in the plane of the paper. Thus, the two-fold symmetry of GPb does not match the two-fold symmetry of PhK. Distance constraints indicate that it would not be possible for GPb to exploit the symmetry of PhK by having one GPb subunit bound to one lobe and the other subunit bound to the adjacent PhK lobe. The distance between the PhK catalytic sites on the lobes is 220 &#x000c5;, whereas the separation of Ser14 sites on the two subunits of GPb is 62 &#x000c5;.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>3D Structure of the Smaller PhK Particles by Cryo-EM at 9.8 &#x000c5; Resolution</title><p>Careful examination of particles selected from the micrographs indicated a mixture of large and smaller particles. The high-resolution 3D reconstructions described above for the larger particles could only be performed reliably if the two populations of particles were separated.

A gallery of some class averages of PhK small particles and the corresponding reprojections of the 3D map is shown in <xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>. The EM model of the small particles is illustrated in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A with the same views as in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A&#x02013;2E. The threshold used to display the PhK reduced size model was chosen so as to give a compact particle with continuity that reflects the integrity of the particles as seen on the micrographs. This volume corresponds to a molecular mass of about 500 to 550 kDa. The characteristic &#x0201c;butterfly-like&#x0201d; conformation is easily recognizable, but the size is clearly smaller and more compact (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B). The dimensions of the lobes in the projection are 140 &#x000d7; 40 &#x000c5; compared to 225 &#x000d7; 110 &#x000c5; for the larger particles. The dimensions of the overall structure are 150 &#x000d7; 140 &#x000d7; 90 &#x000c5; compared with 270 &#x000d7; 225 &#x000d7; 160 &#x000c5; for the larger PhK.</p><p>It has been known for some time that the &#x003b1; subunit is prone to proteolysis and loss leading to activation of PhK (<xref rid="bib17 bib23 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Graves et&#x000a0;al., 1973; Huston and Krebs, 1968; Trempe and Carlson, 1987</xref>). The most recent quantitative study by <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hilder et&#x000a0;al. (2005)</xref>, which&#x000a0;examined PhK proteolysis by caspase-3 in the context of ATP regulation during apoptosis, demonstrated the selective cleavage of the &#x003b1; subunit at residue Asp646 resulting in&#x000a0;a 72&#x000a0;kDa and 66 kDa fragments and a 2-fold increase in activity. Therefore, we anticipated that the smaller particles might have resulted from proteolysis and dissociation of the &#x003b1; subunits.</p><p>After this work was completed, we analyzed the PhK preparation by analytical size exclusion chromatography (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>) followed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C). The large and the small particles were not resolved into two peaks during Superdex 200 gel filtration, indicating that the subunits and the possible proteolytic fragments remained associated with the complex on S200 gel filtration (<xref rid="app3" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>). In the SDS gel (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C), dissociation and denaturation of the subunits results in a weakening of the band that represents the &#x003b1; subunit relative to that for the &#x003b2; subunit (and in comparison to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A), suggesting loss of proteolysed fragments. The band intensity ratio &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; ranges from 0.8 at the front of the peak to 0.5 for the tailing edge. This is in contrast to the gel for freshly prepared material, where the two bands corresponding to the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits are equally intense (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). The gel electrophoresis suggests that the &#x003b1; subunit might have been partially proteolysed. This would be consistent with the higher ratio of activity (pH 6.8/pH 8.2) for calcium-activated PhK than is usually found. The lack of extended lobes in our 3D model of the smaller PhK particles also supports the loss of the &#x003b1; subunits. We propose that during specimen preparation for the EM studies, the proteolysed fragments are separated upon dialysis and dilution so that in the electron microscope we observe a mixture of (&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;&#x003b4;)<sub>4</sub> and (&#x003b2;&#x003b3;&#x003b4;)<sub>4</sub> or possibly (&#x003b2;&#x003b4;)<sub>4</sub> PhK particles. The SDS gel in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A was recorded immediately after preparation of the PhK, where there appears to be no proteolysis. The gel in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C was recorded several months later after initial tests and EM studies had been completed.</p><p>Comparison of Figures <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B suggests that the small particle might have also lost the &#x003b3; subunit, although it is difficult to discern a relative weakening of the &#x003b3; subunit band compared with that for the intact &#x003b2; subunit in the SDS gel (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C). If the &#x003b3;&#x000a0;subunit has also dissociated, it would remain in solution and contribute to the catalytic activity. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C, the &#x003b3; subunit runs at a molecular mass that is less than the 45 kDa observed for the intact &#x003b3; subunit in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A. It has previously been noted that the &#x003b3; subunit is sensitive to proteolysis between the kinase domain and the calmodulin-binding domain (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cox and Johnson, 1992</xref>, and references therein), releasing a kinase domain that is no longer sensitive to calcium dependence and is constitutively active. It is also possible that loss of the &#x003b1; subunits results in reorganization of the subunits so that the &#x003b3; subunit locates at a different site, but we consider this less likely in view of the recognition properties of the PhK assembly.</p><p>The apparent difference in molecular mass between the large and small particles estimated from the volumes of the 3D EM maps is &#x0223c;750 kDa. The loss of four &#x003b1; subunits would correspond to a loss of 4 &#x000d7; 138 kDa = 552 kDa. The loss of the four &#x003b3; subunits would correspond to a further loss of 4 &#x000d7; 44.7 kDa = 179 kDa. The loss of both the &#x003b1; and &#x003b3; subunits would correspond to 730&#x000a0;kDa, roughly in agreement with the difference observed from the EM maps. However, the threshold level used to display the EM maps is partly empirical and quantitative estimates of molecular mass are approximate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The PhK holoenzyme has an &#x003b1;<sub>4</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>4</sub>&#x003b3;<sub>4</sub>&#x003b4;<sub>4</sub> stoichiometry and a corresponding molecular mass of 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>Da. Cross-linking and immunoelectron microscopy from the work of Carlson and colleagues have provided information for the possible subunit arrangement in the PhK holoenzyme. These results are summarized in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>. The tetramers associate in a head-to-head arrangement with one (&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;&#x003b4;)<sub>2</sub> tetramer comprising each lobe of the &#x0201c;butterfly.&#x0201d; The lobes are connected by bridges that appear to be formed, at least in large part, by the &#x003b2; subunits. The important role for the &#x003b2; subunit in forming the quaternary structure of PhK is supported by various observations. (i) An epitope in the &#x003b2; subunit (residues 708&#x02013;815) is localized to an interior position on the lobes near the interconnecting cross-bridges (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). (ii) Selective proteolysis of the &#x003b1; subunit does not abolish bridges, whereas proteolysis of both &#x003b2; and&#x000a0;&#x003b1; leads to the formation of unbridged single lobes (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Trempe et al., 1986</xref>). (iii) An &#x003b1;&#x003b3;&#x003b4; trimer has been produced by LiBr-mediated precipitation of the &#x003b2; subunit from the holoenzyme (<xref rid="bib38 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Pickett-Gies and Walsh, 1985; Wilkinson et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). The &#x003b1;&#x003b3;&#x003b4; complex is devoid of bridge elements as seen on electron microscope micrographs (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Trempe et al., 1986</xref>). (iv) There are two bridges but four &#x003b2; subunits, suggesting the occurrence of &#x003b2;/&#x003b2; dimerization in an interlobal bridging; in support of this notion, cross-linking of the nonactivated holoenzyme with a short cross-linker results in the formation of a &#x003b2;/&#x003b2; dimer (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ayers et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>). (v) Cross-linking experiments have shown that Lys303 from the &#x003b3; subunit can form cross-links with Arg18 in the N-terminal region of the &#x003b2; subunit (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Nadeau et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). The position of the &#x003b3; subunit seen in the cryo-EM images is consistent with this.</p><p>The &#x003b1; subunit is the most susceptible of the four subunits to proteolysis by a number of proteases (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Trempe and Carlson, 1987</xref>). It is presumed to be largely surface exposed and it is likely that the exterior lobes are largely composed of &#x003b1; subunits. This is&#x000a0;supported by two findings. (i) The location of epitopes for monoclonal antibodies against the &#x003b1; subunit (amino residues 1132&#x02013;1237) situated at the top of the lobes of PhK (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Wilkinson et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>). (ii) Cross-linking experiments using transglutaminase have shown that small amounts of &#x003b1;&#x003b1; dimers are formed with activated PhK that are not observed with nonactivated PhK (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Nadeau and Carlson, 1994</xref>). This finding suggests that the polypeptide backbones of the &#x003b1;-subunits stretch from the lobe tip to a more central location where they abut. Interactions between &#x003b1; and other subunits exist. The N-terminal &#x0223c;500 residues of the &#x003b1;-subunit contains a region that interacts with the &#x003b2;-subunit (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nadeau et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>), and this later has a central location within each lobe (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>). Cross-linking experiments have shown that the C-terminal region of the &#x003b1;-subunit (residues 1060&#x02013;1237) interacts with the &#x003b3; subunit (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Nadeau et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>) and an interaction between residues 724 and 981 of the &#x003b1;-subunit and&#x000a0;the C-terminal domain of the &#x003b3;-subunit has also been demonstrated (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Harris et&#x000a0;al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>In our new work, we have localized the &#x003b3; subunit by polyclonal antibody binding and by molecular model fitting to the 9.9 &#x000c5; resolution structure of PhK to a site on the interior of the lobes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C and shown schematically in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>). In the proposed location of PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub>, the &#x003b3; subunit interacts with the other subunits in a way that is consistent with the cross-linking experiments. The C-terminal region of the &#x003b3; subunit (residues 298&#x02013;396) acts as an autoinhibitor of catalytic activity. In the presence of calcium, it is proposed that the interaction of the C-terminal region with the calmodulin-&#x003b4;-subunit Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor serves to relieve inhibition. The interaction most likely involves the PhK calmodulin-binding region residues 343&#x02013;366 (termed PhK5) (<xref rid="bib9 bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cook et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Dasgupta and Blumenthal, 1995; Dasgupta et&#x000a0;al., 1989</xref>) and possibly the less conserved residues 302&#x02013;326 (PhK13). There is currently no direct structural information for this C-terminal component of the &#x003b3; subunit. The PhK&#x003b3;<sub>t</sub> located in our 3D model suggests that its C-terminal domain is oriented toward the bridge (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D). Nanogold labeling studies have shown that the &#x003b4; subunit is located very close to the bridge (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Traxler et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>; dark green in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>).</p><p>In our proposed model, only one GPb monomer from the dimer is firmly bound to PhK in the PhK/GPb complex. The other monomer apparently projects into the solution and is not visualized upon averaging. This arrangement would lead to the formation of GPab hybrids in which one subunit is phosphorylated and the other is not, at least transiently. There is supportive evidence (reviewed in <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et&#x000a0;al., 1971</xref>), which suggest that partially phosphorylated GPab intermediates are produced that have properties intermediate between the non-phospho-GPb and the phospho-GPa states (<xref rid="bib18 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Harris and Graves, 1990; Heilmeyer et&#x000a0;al., 1970</xref>).</p><p>In our proposed PhK/GPb complex, GPb recognition by PhK could involve not only the local epitope around Ser14 but also other regions of GPb by other sites on the &#x003b3; subunit and possibly other subunits such as the &#x003b1; subunits. <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Andreeva et&#x000a0;al. (2002)</xref> have identified an interaction between the N-terminal region of GPb (residues 17&#x02013;484), which lacks the phosphorylation site, and the regulatory &#x003b1; subunit of PhK (residues 864&#x02013;1014). Both the holoenzyme PhK and the &#x003b3; kinase subunit of PhK exhibit similar K<sub>m</sub> for substrate GPb of 8&#x02013;9 &#x003bc;M (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, the kinase subunit has an almost 1000-fold higher K<sub>m</sub> (1.8 mM) for a peptide substrate from GPb (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lowe et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>), suggesting that even in the kinase subunit there might be remote docking sites that increase affinity of PhK for GPb. Similar results were observed in early work with the PhK holoenzyme (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Tabatabai and Graves, 1978</xref>).</p><p>Both PhK and GPb are found localized on glycogen particles in muscle. The GPb glycogen-binding site is 30 &#x000c5; away from the catalytic site (shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>D). The entrance to the catalytic site is by a crevice that is able to accommodate four or five glucose units. It has been proposed that GPb is localized on glycogen through its glycogen-binding site and that the enzyme might be able to carry out the phosphorolysis of several glucose units in a processive mechanism before the enzyme must rebind the glycogen substrate. In our model, when complexed with PhK, the glycogen site of GPb is exposed and the site is located toward the top of the PhK lobes. Previous work has shown that PhK &#x003b1; subunits participate in the formation of the complex between glycogen and GPb via a direct interaction between the top of the lobes (&#x003b1; subunit) and the glycogen (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Andreeva et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The observation that the PhK preparation contained a significant number of small particles in addition to the larger more conventional particles was surprising. A key step in the calculation of the high-resolution PhK structure was to select for&#x000a0;a homogeneous class of particles. From the shape of the small particles, the calculated mass loss and the proposed location of the &#x003b1; subunit at the end of the lobes, we consider it possible that the small PhK particles have lost their &#x003b1; subunits. Partial selective loss of the &#x003b1; subunit from PhK particles observed on the SDS gel explains the higher than usual pH 6.8/8.2 activity ratio (0.125) observed in our activity measurements. The &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; regulatory subunits act as inhibitors of &#x003b3; catalytic activity. Alleviation of inhibition occurs through phosphorylation, or by raising pH from 6.8 to 8.2 (which might mimic the increase in negative charge resulting from phosphorylation), or by proteolysis (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brushia and Walsh, 1999</xref>). The &#x003b1; subunit is targeted by most proteases and far more rapidly than the &#x003b2; subunit (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Trempe and Carlson, 1987</xref>). Studies have shown that PhK is a substrate for caspase on induction of apoptosis and suggest that PhK activation by this route might be important for the generation of ATP during programmed cell death (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hilder et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). In addition, the 3D model for the smaller particles also indicates a possible loss of the &#x003b3; subunit. Loss of the &#x003b1; subunits through proteolysis could weaken the association of the &#x003b3; subunit with the particle, resulting in release of the catalytic &#x003b3; subunit. The &#x003b3; subunit&#x000a0;also appears to have reduced molecular mass corresponding to the cleavage between the kinase and calmodulin-binding domains, which would result in a constitutively active kinase unregulated by calcium or the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits.

Five microliters PhK at about 1 mg/ml was placed on a 400-mesh copper grid coated with a thin holey-carbon film. The grid was blotted, vitrified by freeze plunging in liquid ethane, and transferred at liquid nitrogen temperature into the microscope using a side-entry nitrogen-cooled Gatan 626 cryoholder. All images were taken on a JEM-2100F (JEOL) using an acceleration voltage of 200 kV at a magnification of 50,000&#x000d7; with a defocus from &#x02212;2.8 to &#x02212;4.8 &#x003bc;m (nominal).</p><p>For the PhK/GPb complex, PhK (2.22 mg/ml) was incubated with GPb (1.08&#x000a0;mg/ml) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C at a molar ratio of 1 PhK (&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;&#x003b4;) for 0.8 GPb dimers. Five microliters was deposited on a holey-carbon film grid, and the grid was washed by contact with a drop of dialysis buffer for 30 s, blotted, vitrified, and examined in the electron microscope as described above.</p><p>Micrographs of the negatively stained immunolabeled PhK were obtained with a Philips CM120 (FEI) at 100 kV. PhK, in a buffer of 200 mM NaCl, 0.5&#x000a0;mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and HEPES 50 mM (pH 8.2), was incubated with 4-fold molar excess of &#x003b3;-antibodies for 90 min at room temperature to allow PhK-&#x003b3;-subunit-antibody complex formation.
