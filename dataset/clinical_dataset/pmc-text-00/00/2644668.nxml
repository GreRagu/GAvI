The utility of these tests in subjects with signs and symptoms of asthma but without a clear diagnosis has not been investigated. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of mannitol to identify exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) as a manifestation of BHR; compared this with methacholine; and compared the sensitivity and specificity of mannitol and methacholine for a clinician diagnosis of asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>509 people (6&#x02013;50 yr) were enrolled, 78% were atopic, median FEV<sub>1 </sub>92.5% predicted, and a low NAEPPII asthma score of 1.2. Subjects with symptoms of seasonal allergy were excluded. BHR to exercise was defined as a &#x02265; 10% fall in FEV<sub>1 </sub>on at least one of two tests, to methacholine a PC<sub>20 </sub>&#x02264; 16 mg/ml and to mannitol a 15% fall in FEV<sub>1 </sub>at &#x02264; 635 mg or a 10% fall between doses. The clinician diagnosis of asthma was made on examination, history, skin tests, questionnaire and response to exercise but they were blind to the mannitol and methacholine results.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mannitol and methacholine were therapeutically equivalent to identify EIB, a clinician diagnosis of asthma, and prevalence of BHR. The sensitivity/specificity of mannitol to identify EIB was 59%/65% and for methacholine it was 56%/69%. The BHR was mild. Mean EIB % fall in FEV<sub>1 </sub>in subjects positive to exercise was 19%, (SD 9.2), mannitol PD<sub>15 </sub>158 (CI:129,193) mg, and methacholine PC<sub>20 </sub>2.1(CI:1.7, 2.6)mg/ml. The prevalence of BHR was the same: for exercise (43.5%), mannitol (44.8%), and methacholine (41.6%) with a test agreement between 62 &#x00026; 69%. The sensitivity and specificity for a clinician diagnosis of asthma was 56%/73% for mannitol and 51%/75% for methacholine. The sensitivity increased to 73% and 72% for mannitol and methacholine when two exercise tests were positive.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this group with normal FEV<sub>1</sub>, mild symptoms, and mild BHR, the sensitivity and specificity for both mannitol and methacholine to identify EIB and a clinician diagnosis of asthma were equivalent, but lower than previously documented in well-defined populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This was a multi-center trial comprising 25 sites across the United States of America.

A correct diagnosis is important in order for patients to receive appropriate therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Because bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is a hallmark of asthma, bronchial provocation challenge tests (BPTs) with a variety of agents have been used to assist in its diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Methacholine is a commonly used agent, delivered as a wet aerosol. Methacholine acts directly on acetylcholine receptors on smooth muscle causing contraction and airway narrowing. Methacholine has been reported to have a high sensitivity to identify BHR and a negative test is often used to exclude asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Provocation tests that use indirect stimuli (e.g. exercise and mannitol) have a high specificity for asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] causing smooth muscle contraction by release of endogenous mediators including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and histamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Evaporative water loss occurs in conditioning the inspired air and causes exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) by inflammatory mediators of mast cell origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Exercise is generally recognised as having a low sensitivity to identify BHR; EIB is consistent with a diagnosis of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and responds to chronic treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and other drugs used in the treatment of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>A dry powder of mannitol has been developed as an indirect BPT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and is available as a standardized test kit. The test kit contains pre-filled mannitol capsules in escalating doses and a hand-held dry powder inhaler device. Safety and efficacy of mannitol as a BPT were established in a large Phase III clinical trial in patients with asthma and in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The usefulness of mannitol as a BPT in subjects with signs and symptoms of asthma but no clear diagnosis has not been investigated previously. The aim was to study a large population of subjects to compare the sensitivity and specificity of mannitol with methacholine to detect EIB as a manifestation of BHR and to identify a clinician diagnosis of asthma.</p><sec><title>Subjects: inclusion criteria</title><p>Subjects aged 6&#x02013;50 years (BMI &#x0003c; 35) with signs and symptoms suggestive of asthma according to the National Institute of Health (NIH) Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] but without a firm diagnosis of asthma or an exclusion of the diagnosis of asthma (e.g. had an equivocal diagnosis of asthma or had been referred for further investigation of asthma-type symptoms) were included. Subjects had at least Step 1 symptoms according to the NAEPPII asthma severity grading (symptoms &#x02264; 2 times per week; asymptomatic between exacerbations; exacerbations of only a few hours to a few days; and night time symptoms of &#x02264; 2 times per month). They were required to have an FEV<sub>1 </sub>&#x02265; 70% of the predicted value at the Screening Visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Subjects were excluded from participating in this study if they: had any known other pulmonary disease; had smoked more than 1 cigarette per week within the past year or had a &#x02265; 10 pack year smoking history; had a respiratory tract infection within the previous 4 weeks; had been skin test positive to aeroallergens that were present in the environment during the time of enrolment and reported worsening of symptoms when exposed to these aeroallergens during the study; had been diagnosed at Screening Visit as definitively having asthma (95 to 100% likelihood) or not having asthma (0 to &#x0003c; 5% likelihood); had clinically significantly abnormal chest x-ray or ECG; or had failed to observe washout of medications that would interfere with BPT (including, but not limited to, no use of corticosteroids within 4 weeks of the Screening Visit).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol was approved by a central institutional review board. Each subject or parent gave informed consent in writing. The study consisted of 5 visits to the clinic. On the Screening Visit the following were assessed: eligibility; demographic data; medical history; medications; spirometry with reversibility (following 360 mcg of albuterol); allergy skin test reactivity to common allergens (positive test taken as 3 mm wheal). The NIH NAEPPII questionnaire was answered and a score was assigned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate were measured in the sitting position and an ECG performed. Based on this information, a respiratory physician assigned one of 6 diagnoses at this visit on the basis of the likelihood of asthma as follows: asthma is extremely likely or definite (95%&#x02013;100% likelihood); asthma is very likely (72.5 to &#x0003c; 95%); asthma is probable (50 to &#x0003c; 72.5%); asthma is possible (27.5 to &#x0003c; 50%); asthma is unlikely but cannot be excluded (5 to 27.5%); and asthma is very unlikely (0-&#x0003c;5%). Those with 5 to 95% likelihood were included in the study.</p><p>Visit 2 occurred 1&#x02013;4 days after Visit 1 and within 2 hrs of the time of Screening. Adverse events, medications, and withholding times were reviewed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), and spirometry measured to confirm values on the screening day. This was followed by a brief physical examination. Exercise was performed with vital signs being measured before and after exercise. At Visit 3, the procedures were the same as Visit 2 and occurred within 1&#x02013;4 days. At Visit 4, adverse events and medications were reviewed, withholding times were checked, and spirometry was performed to confirm FEV<sub>1 </sub>was within 15% of Visit 1. The challenge agent was either mannitol or methacholine, and the choice was randomly determined. The time of the test was documented for each challenge. Vital signs were measured in the sitting position before and after the challenge test. Cough and pulse oximetry were recorded during mannitol challenges. Full spirometry was measured before and at 15 minutes after completion of the mannitol challenge with FEV<sub>1 </sub>only being performed after each dose. ECG was performed before and after mannitol challenge. Visit 5 was a repeat of the procedures of Visit 4 with the reciprocal challenge being administered (either mannitol or methacholine). A respiratory physician then assigned one of the diagnoses of likelihood of asthma evaluated at the Screening Visit, above. The NAEPII asthma severity grading score was also re-evaluated at Visit 5 but not necessarily by the same physician.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Medications and other factors that may decrease bronchial hyperresponsiveness and their required withholding periods</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left"><bold>FACTOR</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Withholding Period</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>Inhaled agents</bold></td><td align="left">Short acting bronchodilators (isoproterenol, isoetharine, metaproterenol, albuterol, levalbuterol, terbutaline) (e.g. Proventil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>or Ventolin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)</td><td align="center">8 hr</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Inhaled anticholinergics or combination products (e.g. Atrovent<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>or Combivent<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)</td><td align="center">1 week</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Medium acting bronchodilators (ipratropium)</td><td align="center">1 week</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Long acting inhaled bronchodilators (salmeterol, formoterol) (e.g. Serevent<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>or Foradil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)</td><td align="center">2 weeks</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Inhaled corticosteroid/long acting inhaled bronchodilator combination (e.g. Advair<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)</td><td align="center">4 weeks</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Oral bronchodilators</bold></td><td align="left">Theophylline</td><td align="center">24 hr</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Intermediate theophylline</td><td align="center">48 hr</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Long acting theophylline</td><td align="center">48 hr</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Standard &#x003b2;-agonist tablets</td><td align="center">24 hr</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Long acting &#x003b2;-agonist tablets</td><td align="center">48 hr</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Corticosteroids</bold></td><td align="left">There is no washout for topical steroids applied to skin unless they are high potency steroids</td><td align="center">4 weeks</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Other medications</bold></td><td align="left">Hydroxyzine, cetirizine (and other antihistamines)</td><td align="center">72 hr</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Tiotropium bromide</td><td align="center">72 hr</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Nasals steroids</td><td align="center">1 week</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">&#x003b2;-blockers</td><td align="center">1 week</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Cromolyn sodium</td><td align="center">2 weeks</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Nedocromil</td><td align="center">2 weeks</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">Leukotriene modifiers</td><td align="center">6 weeks</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Foods</bold></td><td align="left">Coffee, tea, cola drinks, chocolate (caffeinated foods)</td><td align="center">12 hr</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><bold>Strenuous exercise or exposure to cold air to a level that would be expected to interfere with challenges</bold></td><td align="center">12 hr</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Tobacco</bold></td><td></td><td align="center">6 hr</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec><title>Bronchial provocation tests</title><sec><title>Exercise challenge</title><p>Exercise was performed by running on a motorised treadmill whilst breathing medical grade dry air (20&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C) from a Douglas Bag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

specificity were equivalent for mannitol and methacholine to identify EIB and a clinical diagnosis of asthma. There were no serious adverse events associated with the tests and both were generally well tolerated.</p><p>Mannitol sensitivity to identify EIB was lower than that previously reported in subjects with a definite diagnosis of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The lower sensitivity of mannitol to identify EIB reported here is consistent with the mild EIB (50% of subjects had falls in FEV<sub>1 </sub>&#x02264; 15%) documented in this group who did not have a definite diagnosis of asthma. The % fall in FEV<sub>1 </sub>in the asthmatics reported by Brannan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] was 40 &#x000b1; 19% (SD) and by Munoz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] it was 37% &#x000b1; 16% (SD). In the study of Holzer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] a PD<sub>15 </sub>to mannitol had a sensitivity of 83% to identify EIB in a group of athletes with a 25.4% &#x000b1; 15% (SD) fall in FEV<sub>1 </sub>after eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea, a surrogate challenge for EIB.</p><p>The sensitivity of mannitol to identify a Exc+ 20% fall in FEV<sub>1 </sub>was &#x0003e; 80% when those with a prolonged mannitol test time were excluded. Sensitivity of the mannitol to detect a Exc+10% fall was also &#x0003e; 80% in those with an asthma symptom severity score of 2 rather than 1, although the numbers with this score were smaller.</p><p>Sensitivity and specificity of methacholine and mannitol for a clinical diagnosis of asthma was equivalent in this study, but the values were lower than those reported in well-defined populations of asthmatic and healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and similar to those reported for epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the children less than 18 yrs, however, mannitol had a 18.5% higher specificity (81.4% vs 62.9%) for identifying a clinical diagnosis of asthma and a 10% lower sensitivity (60.1% vs 70%) to identify EIB compared with methacholine.</p><p>This lower than expected sensitivity for mannitol and methacholine to identify EIB or a clinical diagnosis may be explained by the relatively unusual nature of this group of subjects who would not have qualified either for a clinical study on asthmatic subjects or a study on healthy subjects. The exclusion criteria required that the subjects not be symptomatic to the allergens to which they demonstrated atopy at the time of the study. This too is unusual and may affect mast cell number and IgE status. There was a lack of agreement between the clinical diagnosis and response to the challenge tests in 27% of the subjects; 15% of subjects given a diagnosis of asthma were negative to all three challenge tests and 12% with two or more positive challenge tests were deemed not to have an asthma diagnosis at Visit 5. The dose of mannitol (PD<sub>15</sub>) or concentration of methacholine (PC<sub>20</sub>) in those who were positive in this study was consistent with the values reported previously in clinically recognised asthmatics not taking inhaled corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The prevalence of BHR identified by the three tests differed by only 3.2% (from 41.6% to 44.8%). This suggests that the cut-off points used to define BHR were appropriate. Further, the range of severity of BHR was similar for all the tests with 50% being in the mild range for mannitol and exercise and 75% in the mild range for methacholine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However it was not always the same subject responsive to all the BPTs and only 17.9% of subjects were positive to all three challenge tests. This probably reflects the natural variability of the test responses in people with mild BHR and intermittent symptoms.</p><p>Some long-held beliefs about methacholine were not upheld by the results of this study. Methacholine did not have a higher sensitivity than exercise and mannitol to identify BHR in this population, and the prevalence of BHR was similar for all tests. Methacholine did not have a high negative predictive value for a clinical diagnosis of asthma. There were 118 subjects negative to methacholine who were given a diagnosis of asthma at Visit 5. It was also not uncommon for methacholine to miss EIB, and 73 of the 163 subjects (45%) positive to exercise were negative to methacholine, confirming previous findings in young people with good lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The sensitivity of a positive response to the first exercise test to predict a positive response to the second test (62%) was the same as the sensitivity of mannitol and methacholine to predict at least one positive test to exercise. This low sensitivity probably relates to the variability in the mild response to exercise, particularly in those without symptoms of allergy at the time of testing. By performing a second test, an extra 44 people were identified as having EIB. Care was taken in this study to minimise the potential for variability, and there was good overall agreement between the two exercise test results; however, this was primarily due to the number of negative exercise tests.</p><p>Only one exercise test and one time point of &#x02265; 10% was required to be the 'gold' standard used for BHR. This criterion may be interpreted by some investigators as not strict enough because of the variability of the response to exercise. However the value for sensitivity of mannitol to identify EIB was relatively unchanged (59.8% vs 58.3%) when only those subjects with two time points on one exercise challenge were &#x02265; 10%, or one time point was greater than &#x02265; 15%, were included in the analysis. The value for sensitivity for methacholine however rose from 55.3% to 63.1% applying the same criteria.</p><p>There were 7.5% of subjects with a positive response to bronchodilator at baseline who were not excluded at entry on the basis of having a &#x0003e; 95% chance of having asthma, presumably as the other evidence was not supportive. This group of 28 showed a higher value for sensitivity of mannitol (68.4% vs 59%) and methacholine (73.7% vs 56%) to identify EIB when compared with the entire population.</p><p>Cockcroft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] has found that methacholine sensitivity to identify BHR of 4 mg/ml or more is lower using the dosimeter method compared with the tidal breathing method. The dosimeter method used here is one recommended in the American Thoracic Society guidelines that categorize BHR between 4&#x02013;16 mg/ml as borderline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], is in common use, and delivery of the aerosol by this method involves a similar inspired breathing pattern as the mannitol with which it was being compared. We challenged to 16 mg/ml and, on the basis of the Cockcroft observation, this may be equivalent to 8 mg/ml on the tidal breathing method. A PC<sub>20 </sub>of &#x0003e; 8 mg/ml is the value for normality illustrated in the 2007 GINA guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and stated by the British Thoracic Society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>This study included steroid na&#x000ef;ve subjects who were considered to have a greater than 5% and less than 95% probability of having asthma at entry based on spirometry, response to bronchodilator, symptoms, history and skin tests. The clinical value in comparing different diagnostic tools, such as the challenge tests used here, cannot really be judged because there is no gold standard test for the diagnosis of asthma. The strategy used here for a 'gold standard' for the diagnosis of asthma was to have a respiratory physician assign a diagnosis at Visit 5 on the basis of having all the information (including the exercise test results) except the results of the methacholine and mannitol tests. The information available was likely to be more than most clinicians would have available at assessment and thus as close to a clinical gold standard as one is likely to find. There was good agreement (71.6%) with the exercise test result and ClinDx5+ diagnosis of asthma with only 14 subjects positive to exercise being considered not to have asthma (ClinDx5-). This supports the fact that BHR to exercise, i.e. EIB, is accepted by clinicians as consistent with a diagnosis of asthma. The agreement between a ClinDx5 diagnosis and the methacholine result was 59.6% and mannitol was 61.8%.</p><p>In the Phase 3 study on mannitol, in subjects with known asthma and healthy subjects without asthma, the specificity and sensitivity of mannitol to identify a clinical diagnosis of asthma was 59.8% and 95.2% and it was 88.7% and 95% when those with a negative mannitol test being treated with inhaled corticosteroids were excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In this study in subjects with symptoms but without a definite diagnosis of asthma at entry mannitol had a sensitivity and specificity of 56% and 73% and this was no different to methacholine 51% and 75%.</p><p>In conclusion, mannitol and methacholine provided therapeutic equivalence to identify BHR, EIB, and a clinical diagnosis of asthma in a group of subjects suspected of having asthma but without a clear diagnosis. While mannitol has potential to replace other challenges for BPT, any of these tests can provide specific information and insight regarding mechanism in a particular patient.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>SDA is the inventor of the mannitol test however the intellectual property is owned by her employer, the Sydney South West Area Health Service.
