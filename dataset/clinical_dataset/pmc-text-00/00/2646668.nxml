A polymer-blend nanoparticle system was engineered to incorporate temporally controlled sequential release of the combination drug payload. Hereby, PTX was encapsulated in the pH-responsive rapid releasing polymer, poly(beta-amino ester) (PbAE), while CER was present in the slow releasing polymer, poly(<sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-lactide-<italic>co</italic>-glycolide) (PLGA) within these blend nanoparticles. When particle formulations were administered intravenously to MCF7 and MCF7<sub>TR</sub> tumor bearing mice, higher concentrations of PTX were found in the blood due to longer retention time and an enhanced tumor accumulation relative to administration of free drug. In addition, the PLGA/PbAE blend nanoparticles were effective in enhancing the residence time of both drugs at the tumor site by reducing systemic clearance. Overall, these results are highly encouraging for development of multifunctional polymer-blend nanoparticle formulations that can be used for temporal-controlled administration of two drugs from a single formulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Multidrug resistant tumors</kwd><kwd>polymer-blend nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>paclitaxel</kwd><kwd>ceramide</kwd><kwd>biodistribution</kwd><kwd>noncompartmental pharmacokinetics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>mp800030k</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>mp-2008-00030k</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major clinical obstacle in cancer therapy is the development of resistance to a multitude of chemotherapeutic agents, a phenomenon termed multidrug resistance (MDR).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>) The development of drug resistance in a small subset of tumor cells is believed to be the cause for tumor survival despite invasive chemotherapy. Chemoresistance can generally result from either of two means: (1) by physically impairing delivery to the tumor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>) (e.g., poor absorption, increased metabolism/excretion, and/or poor diffusion of drugs into the tumor mass) or (2) through intracellular mechanisms that raise the threshold for cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> The latter is commonly implicated in the development of MDR, and, often, more than one mechanism, either simultaneous or sequential, may be responsible for the MDR phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> The most frequently occurring causes of MDR include overexpression of membrane-bound ATP-dependent drug efflux pumps from the ABC transporter family (most notably P-glycoprotein/<italic>MDR-1</italic>), modifications in drug metabolism through glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase or cytochrome P450 activity, alterations in DNA repair mechanisms, and critical alterations in the cellular apoptotic signaling mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></p><p>For this purpose, we have hypothesized that a multifunctional nanoparticle-based therapeutic strategy would be beneficial for the treatment of MDR tumor, especially with the use of combination strategies that evade efflux transport and lower the tumor apoptotic threshold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Based on the principle that MDR has been shown to result from metabolism of the apoptotic mediator ceramide by the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) to elevate the apoptotic threshold,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> this novel therapeutic strategy aims to restore the alternation in the cellular apoptotic signaling through a combination therapy of paclitaxel (PTX), a microtubule stabilizing agent and promoter of apoptosis, and exogenous C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide (CER), which can propagate apoptotic signaling and allow for enhanced cell-kill response.</p><p>Based on preliminary evidence, it was found that a combination therapy of PTX with CER is most effective against MDR breast and ovarian cancer when CER is administered with a time delay (typically 6 h) following PTX administration. To incorporate this temporal spacing of drug release, a polymer-blend nanoparticle was designed by blending 70% by weight poly(<sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-lactic-<italic>co</italic>-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to 30% by weight poly(beta-amino ester) (PbAE) to control release of the PTX + CER combination therapy for optimal therapeutic efficacy. This strategy was conceived based on earlier work of Little et al.,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) where PLGA/PbAE blend microspheres were used for DNA vaccine delivery in antigen presenting cells. A large library (&#x0003e;5,000) of poly(beta-amino esters) (PbAEs) has been synthesized and evaluated for cellular toxicity and transfection potential, by reacting diol-diacrylates with various types of primary and secondary amines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> A representative hydrophobic PbAE, synthesized by the addition reaction of 4,4&#x02032;-trimethyldipiperidine with 1,4-butanediol diacrylate, has unique pH-solubility properties; the polymer remains intact at pH 7.4, but rapidly dissolves at pH 6.5.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) This PLGA/PbAE blend nanoparticle was designed to immediately release PTX by rapid dissolution of PbAE in a lower pH environment, such as the tumor microenvironment (pH &#x0003c; 6.5), or in the endosome/lysosome of a cell following internalization. Conversely, CER was expected to exhibit slower release (being localized with the pH-insensitive polymer, PLGA), facilitating cellular apoptosis. From previous studies, we have observed that the exogenously administered CER reinstates the apoptotic signal to resensitize the cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic drug PTX.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) Additionally, long-circulating, nanoparticle-based, systemic delivery of the combination therapy enhances efficacy at the cellular level by increasing intracellular drug accumulation and optimizing the dose administered, and on a whole body level by increasing targeting and residence time of the drug at the tumor mass upon systemic administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup></p><p>Site-specific drug delivery systems increase the therapeutic benefit by delivering a greater fraction of the dose at the target site, which minimizes the amount of therapeutic that accumulates at nonspecific targets. Drug delivery throughout the tumor mass is crucial for the treatment to be effective, since residual cancer cell survival can promote regrowth and often becomes the cause for drug resistance.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>) For colloidal carriers, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, these barriers can be overcome through the unique properties of tumor neovasculature.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) Angiogenesis (the formation of new vasculature) associated with rapid growth of the tumor mass results in fenestrations in tumor capillaries.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) These fenestrations (or gaps between adjacent endothelial cells), are sized around 200&#x02212;400 nm.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) In addition, the lymphatic system, which usually runs alongside the blood circulation to clear macromolecules from tissues, is impaired in solid tumors. This lack of lymphatic drainage results in decreased clearance of macromolecules (&#x0003e;40 kDa) within the vicinity of the tumor.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) Together, these two physiologic parameters of the tumor mass, termed the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) can be taken advantage of to improve drug delivery to tumors mediated by nanocarriers.</p><p>Previous studies from our group have shown that paclitaxel (PTX)-containing PEO-PCL nanoparticles remain stable <italic>in vivo</italic>, and retain the PEO copolymer (Pluronic) surface layer to increase the circulating half-life and plasma residence time of PTX from a fraction of an hour to 25.3 and 24.0 h, respectively, alongside a nearly 8-fold decrease in total body clearance of the drug.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> The concentration of PTX inside the tumor mass of mice-bearing human ovarian carcinoma (SKOV3) xenografts, as a result, was 8.7-fold higher 5 h postinjection as compared to mice treated with paclitaxel solution,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) resulting in enhanced therapeutic efficacy of the nanoparticle formulation over solution PTX, seen by the 63% reduction of final tumor volume.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>)</p><p>To examine the effectiveness of PEO-modified PLGA/PbAE blend nanoparticles for improving the tumor accumulation of the PTX + CER drug load, as a means toward enhanced efficacy, we have administered the control and test formulations to mice bearing drug sensitive (MCF7) and MDR (MCF7<sub>TR</sub>) human breast tumor xenografts. In this study, we have examined the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of PTX and CER upon administration in PLGA/PbAE blend nanoparticle formulations in an orthotopic wild-type (drug sensitive) and drug resistant (<italic>MDR-1</italic> positive) MCF7 estrogen-positive human breast adenocarcinoma model. While it is known that nanoparticles enhance drug delivery to tumors by the EPR effect, it is unknown whether MDR physiology has any further effect on tumor drug disposition and retention. These studies, therefore, can allow for an interpretation of the effect of cellular mechanisms of MDR on tumor targeting of the drugs with blend nanoparticles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>1</label><title>Preparation and Characterization of Nanoparticle Formulations</title><p>Polymer-blend nanoparticles were manufactured by blending PLGA (MW 12 kDa, 50:50 molar ratio of lactide to glycolide) (Birmingham Polymers, Pelham, AL) with PbAE [MW 10 kDa kindly supplied by S.L.

In addition, the nanoparticles were coloaded with 20 &#x003bc;Ci of <sup>3</sup>H-PTX per mg of regular PTX and 2.5 &#x003bc;Ci of <sup>14</sup>C-CER per mg of regular CER.

PCL or PLGA was dissolved in acetone together with 20% (w/w) Pluronic F-108 and CER, while PbAE was dissolved in ethanol together with PTX. Both preparations were heated at 37 &#x000b0;C to facilitate dissolution, after which they were joined and instantaneously added to 10 volumes of water at pH 8.0 with rapid magnetic stirring at a rate of 2 mL/min. Polymer&#x02212;drug complexes were dissolved in their respective organic phases at 10 mg of total nanoparticle mass/0.5 mL of organic solvent, using equal amounts of acetone and ethanol. Following overnight stirring to allow for evaporation of the organic solvents, nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 &#x000b0;C, washed with deionized distilled water adjusted to pH 8.0, and stored wet at 4 &#x000b0;C. Alongside, free drug formulations using Cremophore EL and ethanol were prepared, with similar addition of 20 &#x003bc;Ci of <sup>3</sup>H-PTX per mg of regular (cold) PTX, 2.5 &#x003bc;Ci of <sup>14</sup>C-CER per mg of regular CER, and 20 &#x003bc;g of rhodamine-PTX per mg of regular PTX. Thus, hereby, for each dose administered, the animals received radioactive tracers of 1 &#x003bc;Ci of <sup>3</sup>H-PTX and 0.5 &#x003bc;Ci of <sup>14</sup>C-CER, and a fluorescent tracer of 1 &#x003bc;g of rhodamine-PTX.</p><p>Nanoparticles were characterized for size and zeta-potential on a Brookhaven Zeta-PALS analyzer that combines dynamic light scattering for size approximation with zeta-potential analysis (Brookhaven instruments Inc., Holtsville, NY). To determine a drug release profile for PTX and CER from the nanoparticles, 10 mg of lyophilized drug-loaded nanoparticles were initially resuspended in 5 mL of PBS at pH 7.4 and incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 6 h with constant agitation. Every hour, nanoparticles were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and 4 mL of release media was removed for analysis and replaced with 4 mL of PBS pH 7.4 to maintain sink conditions. At the 6 h time point, the pH of the release medium was spiked to 6.5 with HCl, after which the particles continued to incubate under constant agitation. Again, 4 mL samples of release media were removed at every hour, only now replaced with PBS at pH 6.5, and the particles were left to incubate for up until 12 h after the start of the study. PTX loading yield and subsequent release were determined by quantitating the amount of PTX by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 column using 50% acetonitrile:50% phosphate buffer with 20 mM SDS as the mobile phase. To quantitatively track CER, a fluorescent derivative of CER, namely NBD-CER (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA), was loaded into the nanoparticle formulation at 1% w/w, thereby allowing for quantitation as loading yield and subsequent release by fluorescent absorption using 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission.

Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows intracellular delivery of NBD-labeled CER using PLGA 70%/PbAE 30% blend nanoparticles in MCF7 and MCF7<sub>TR</sub> cells and verifies that cell-kill efficacy increased significantly when CER was administered with a delay of several hours following PTX administration in MCF7<sub>TR</sub> cells (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b), increasing from 39.1% cell death when the drugs were coadministered to 52.9% cell death when CER was administered 6 h following CER (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Interestingly, this increase was not observed when PTX was administered with a 6 h delay following CER (38.8% cell death) in this cell line. Additionally, the enhancement of cell-kill with CER coadministration was not observed in MCF7 (drug sensitive) cells as well. To incorporate this dose&#x02212;kinetic relationship into the formulation, a nanoparticle system was designed that could simultaneously carry both the PTX and CER therapeutics, but release each in a controlled manner within the tumor cells. To achieve this temporally controlled release, PLGA was blended with a pH-responsive polymer, PbAE, at a ratio of 70% to 30% respectively. Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref> summarizes the characterization of these particles. The particles were found to have an average size around 200 nm and a negative surface charge expected for the PLGA matrix. PTX and CER were loaded into the particles at 2.5% (w/w) for PTX and 10% (w/w) for CER to ensure preservation of the molar dosing ratio examined in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) without compromising particle size or stability. At this load, loading yield was 100% for both drugs as determined by quantitative analysis of PTX and CER. The intention of this formulation was for PTX specifically to be localized with PbAE for immediate pH-responsive release upon internalization of the nanoparticles in the acidic tumor environment (pH 6.5). CER then was intended to incorporate within the PLGA regions of the nanoparticle for a slower, more sustained release, unaffected by the drop in pH at the tumor site. Thereby, the rapid release of PTX and the slower release of CER would impart the temporal controlled release profile that results in enhanced efficacy against MDR cancer. <italic>In vitro</italic> release simulations (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) revealed just that: PTX experienced a surge in release upon a drop in pH to 6.5, while CER release remained unaffected when the pH decreased from 7.4 (physiological) to 6.5 (tumor). When the nanoparticles were incubated in PBS at pH 7.4, a similar amount of PTX and CER was relased in a one hour span (10.3% PTX and 12.3% CER). However, when the pH on the nanoparticles was dropped to 6.5 to mimic internalization into the tumor environment, PTX exhibited a surge of release (31.9% in 1 h) while the rate of CER release remained unchanged (7.6% in 1 h).

Both <sup>3</sup>H-PTX and <sup>14</sup>C-CER were encapsulated within the nanoparticle and free drug formulations as described in <xref rid="sec2"/> in such a way that each animal received a tracer of 1.0 &#x003bc;Ci of PTX and 0.5 &#x003bc;Ci of CER of which the counts could be simultaneously read on an &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;- scintillation counter. Furthermore, to qualitatively assess drug biodistribution, and particularly tumor localization, resulting from the dose formulation, both the free drug and nanoparticle forms of drug were additionally spiked with a red-fluorescent derivative of PTX (rhodamine-PTX), which could be visualized <italic>in vivo</italic> using an <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging module.</p><p>Quantitative data was obtained by standardizing <sup>3</sup>H and <sup>14</sup>C cpm from individual tissues or blood by the counts-per-minute (cpm) for the dose administered per gram of tissue or mL of blood, to express tissue and blood drug levels over time as % of dose/g or mL. Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a depicts the blood and tumor pharmacokinetic curves for both PTX and CER resulting from administration as free drug as compared to PbAE/PLGA blend nanoparticle delivery in mice bearing MCF7 drug sensitive orthotopic tumor xenografts. As expected, the data shows that nanoparticle delivery prolongs plasma retention of PTX over free drug administration, indicated by a 2-fold increase in PTX from nanoparticle delivery over free drug (1.02 &#x000b1; 0.25 versus 0.46 &#x000b1; 0.08% dose/mL respectively, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Similarly, tumor retention of PTX increases significantly with nanoparticle delivery of the drug, whereby at 12 h out 6.5-fold more PTX resides in the tumor mass compared with the free drug administration (0.53 &#x000b1; 0.08 versus 0.08 &#x000b1; 0.02%/g of nanoparticle versus free PTX, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). What is more striking is that while nanoparticles did not affect CER retention in the blood significantly, the nanoparticles cause significant CER accumulation at the tumor site, initially a 2-fold increase early on at 1 and 6 h, elevating to a 4.5-fold increase by 12 h. Additionally, the maximal concentration of drug at the tumor site within this therapeutic window reaches a significantly higher peak with nanoparticle delivery over the free drug formulation (2.6 &#x000b1; 0.4 versus 1.42 &#x000b1; 0.5), a phenomenon that perhaps explains the efficacy seen with CER treatment alone. Qualitative biodistribution images that traced red-fluorescent PTX (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) similarly revealed that while drug accumulation can be observed in tumors of mice subjected to free drug treatment 6 h out, this signal is lost by 12 h. However, the mice subjected to nanoparticle treatment retain their tumor accumulation signal beyond 6 h to retain visibility even at 12 h out. This result further suggests that the nanoparticles are retained for prolonged periods of time in the tumor mass.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(a) Quantitative blood and tumor and (b) qualitative tumor biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profile of paclitaxel (PTX) and C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide (CER) administered intravenously as free drug and upon encapsulation in poly(ethylene oxide)-surface modified poly(<sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-lactic-<italic>co</italic>-glycolic acid)/poly(beta-amino ester) [70:30% (w/w)] polymer-blend nanoparticle (NP) at 1, 6, and 12 h after administration to MCF7 (drug sensitive) tumor bearing mice.

Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref> summarize the pharmacokinetic parameters of PTX and CER from free drug administration and nanoparticle delivery in blood (plasma) and tumor respectively. As suggested by the plots in Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, nanoparticle delivery increased area-under-the-curve (AUC) in blood, for PTX but not for CER (Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). While mean retention time (MRT), the elimination constant (<italic>K</italic>), half-life (<italic>T</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) and volume of distribution (<italic>V</italic><sub>d</sub>) appeared unchanged for either drug between free drug administration and nanoparticle delivery in the blood, nanoparticles did significantly lower the rate of total body clearance (Cl<sub>t</sub>) for PTX, albeit not for CER, thereby supporting the idea that nanoparticles promote prolonged PTX retention in the blood. Oppositely, though, nanoparticles promoted a significantly increased AUC and decreased Cl<sub>t</sub> for CER in the tumor tissue (Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), although at this site pharmacokinetics of PTX remained unchanged between nanoparticle versus free drug delivery. Interestingly, though, it can be concluded from this study that nanoparticle delivery does benefit both drug treatments, by increasing PTX levels and prolonging PTX retention in the circulation, and by increasing CER retention and decreasing CER clearance from the tumor site.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Summary of Plasma Noncompartmental

From this data, it appears that while nanoparticle delivery does not significantly alter peak concentrations of PTX or CER that accumulate the examined nontarget organs, nanoparticle delivery does appear to prolong clearance of either drug from these nontarget organs. At 6 h postadministration, similar amounts of PTX and CER could be detected in the liver, kidney, spleen, lung and heart of mice bearing either drug sensitive or MDR tumor types. Twelve hours postadministration, traces of both PTX and CER are nearly undetectable in the liver, kidney, spleen, lung and heart of these mice, suggesting clearance of the majority of the administered drug. However, nanoparticle delivery of both PTX and CER are retained at a significantly higher level in these tissue types by 12 h postadministration. Curiously, though, this effect is only observed in mice bearing the MCF7 tumor type, while no differences exist between nanoparticle and free drug retention at 12 h for the MCF7<sub>TR</sub> tumor bearing mice. Although a prolonged retention at nontarget tissues could be a factor for toxicity, extensive studies examining white blood cell counts and liver enzyme activity following both acute and chronic administration of this nanoparticle therapy revealed that the therapy was well tolerated since no such toxicity arises (data not shown).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Quantitative tissue biodistribution profile of (a) paclitaxel (PTX) and (b) C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide (CER) administered as free drug or in poly(ethylene oxide)-surface modified poly(<sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-lactic-<italic>co</italic>-glycolic acid)/poly(beta-amino ester) [70:30% (w/w)) polymer-blend nanoparticle formulations at 1, 6, and 12 h after intravenous administration in MCF7 (drug sensitive) tumor bearing mice.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="mp-2008-00030k_0001" id="gr5" position="float"/></fig><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Quantitative tissue biodistribution profile of (a) paclitaxel (PTX) and (b) C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide (CER) administered as free drug or in poly(ethylene oxide)-surface modified poly(<sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-lactic-<italic>co</italic>-glycolic acid)/poly(beta-amino ester) [70:30% (w/w)) polymer-blend nanoparticle formulations at 1, 6, and 12 h after intravenous administration in MCF7<sub>TR</sub> (drug resistant) tumor bearing mice.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="mp-2008-00030k_0002" id="gr6" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is widely known that nanoparticles are beneficial tumor targeting vehicles due to their passive targeting properties by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, whereby the added advantage of stealth shielding the particles with a poly(ethylene glycol/oxide) (PEO/PEG) surface modification avoids uptake by the reticuloendothelial system, thereby improving circulation time of the nanoparticles.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) The formulation described herein is for a blend of slow releasing PLGA and pH-responsive rapid releasing PbAE for temporal controlled release of PTX with CER to treat MDR cancer, whereby the nanoparticle was surfaced modified with PEO to promote stealth shielding and prolonged circulation of the combination drug therapy. Using radiolabeled derivatives of PTX and CER, namely <sup>3</sup>H-PTX and <sup>14</sup>C-CER, it was possible to quantitatively track drug distribution over time <italic>in vivo</italic> resulting from administration as free drug versus encapsulation within the polymer-blend nanoparticles.</p><p>Drug distribution was monitored in mice bearing either drug sensitive MCF7 or MDR MCF7<sub>TR</sub> tumors, since differences between the physiology of these two tumor types could potentially lead to differences in drug disposition and retention at the tumor site specifically. Surprisingly, there was no difference in magnitude between the tumor accumulations at 6 h after administration of free PTX, nanoparticle PTX, free CER, or nanoparticle CER between the drug sensitive and MDR tumors. Beyond 6 h, levels of PTX and CER delivered by nanoparticles remained unchanged in the MCF7 tumors, while levels of PTX and CER delivered as free drug began to decrease. Overall, the amount of tumor accumulation of both drugs administered in nanoparticles significantly exceeded that of free drug administration at some of the tested time points in the MCF7 tumor bearing animals. This finding supports the hypothesis of enhanced tumor accumulation and retention of nanoparticle-delivered drugs by the EPR effect.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) However, the effects seen in the MDR MCF7<sub>TR</sub> tumors were very different. While the magnitude of drug accumulation between the two tumor types was no different, intratumoral levels of PTX and CER from both free drug and nanoparticle administration tumors dropped drastically in the MCF7<sub>TR</sub> after 6 h to nearly entirely disappear from the tumor by 12 h after administration, whereas drug levels remained steady during this period in the MCF7 tumors. This finding suggests that drug efflux pumps like P-glycoprotein mediate removal of both PTX and CER from the MDR tumor after 6 h, although, since only free drug is susceptible to efflux, we cannot conclude that the drugs must have been released from the nanoparticles by this time point. Although the amount of nanoparticle-delivered CER reaching MCF7<sub>TR</sub> tumors exceeded the amount of CER administered as free drug by 2-fold, similar to the results seen in the MCF7 tumors, we did not observe this increase in PTX delivered as free drug versus nanoparticles. However, this result is in accordance with the prediction that the bulk of PTX releases immediately from this nanoparticle upon internalization into the tumor environment from a drop in pH. Unfortunately, the presence of P-glycoprotein efflux pumps appears to quickly remove the released PTX from the tumor site. Nevertheless, the results still support the increased tumor accumulation of nanoparticle delivered drugs by the EPR effect in the MCF7<sub>TR</sub> tumors as well, although retention of the drugs in the tumor site is hindered by the P-glycoprotein mediated efflux. The systemic pharmacokinetic parameters of CER administered as free drug or nanoparticles were very similar in magnitude and profile between MCF7 and MCF7<sub>TR</sub> tumor bearing mice. Interestingly, in both animal models, plasma CER does not display a profile characteristic of instantaneous input. Rather, CER blood pharmacokinetics exhibit profiles that are more representative of oral absorption. Although the hydrophobicity of free CER may lead to longer residence times at the site of injection, nanoparticle formulations of CER behave similarly while not exhibiting such hydrophobicity. It is unlikely that CER is prematurely released from the nanoparticle to linger at the injection site, since tumor pharmacokinetic results imply that CER is retained in the nanoparticle by 6 h after administration. Since tumor and nonspecific target accumulation of CER follows a similar profile as PTX, with peak accumulation at 1 h after administration (with the exception of MCF7<sub>TR</sub> tumors, where peak accumulation occurred at 6 h), it is again unlikely that peak CER plasma levels take place prior to 30 min after administration. Unfortunately, the pharmacokinetics of CER and other sphingolipids following intravenous administration have not been evaluated to date by other groups, forbidding conclusive statements regarding plasma CER pharmacokinetics. Thus, at this point, it can merely be speculated that CER perhaps resides on the surface of the nanoparticle rather than internally to behave more like free CER in the circulation. This could cause CER of either formulation to linger at the injection site or sequester in more lipophilic compartments.</p><p>Systemic pharmacokinetics of PTX, on the other hand, behaved similarly to the pharmacokinetic profile obtained in other studies,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) and displayed a profile characteristic of instantaneous input whereby peak concentration occurred at the time of injection, with a subsequent disappearance of PTX from the plasma over time. In both the MCF7 and MCF7<sub>TR</sub> tumor bearing mice, PTX administration as free drug peaked upon administration, with a gradual decrease over time to culminate at nearly undetectable levels by 12 h after administration. Nanoparticle administration, on the other hand, caused a prolonged retention of PTX in the circulation of both MCF7 and MCF7<sub>TR</sub> tumor bearing mice seen by the increased amount of drug present in the circulation at 6 h after administration, compared to the amount of free drug present at this time point. Although it appears that PTX retention is more prominent in the MCF7<sub>TR</sub> tumor bearing mice over MCF7 tumor bearing mice, the magnitude of plasma drug level between these two animal models is very similar throughout all time points. These results are supportive of the known effects of PEO-surface modification on nanoparticles to produce prolonged circulation by stealth shielding, and agree well with the blood and tumor pharmacokinetic profile determined for PTX from free drug administration and nanoparticle delivery in SKOV3 tumor bearing mice.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>)</p><p>An evaluation of nonspecific target accumulation revealed that PTX administration in nanoparticles did not significantly alter nontarget accumulation over that of free drug, with neither an increase nor a decrease in drug retention in the most perfused tissues. This result is identical to similar studies conducted for nanoparticle versus free drug accumulation of PTX at nonspecific sites.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>) Although other studies have reported a decreased accumulation in liver, spleen, and lung resulting from nanoparticle administration,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>) we did not observe such results. On the other hand, although CER does not accumulate to any greater amount in nontarget tissues between free drug and nanoparticle administration, the nanoparticle dosage form does result in a prolonged retention of CER in all five nontarget tissues examined, liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and heart. It should be noted that this result was only seen in the MCF7 tumor bearing mice, while not in the MCF7<sub>TR</sub> tumor bearing mice. Given this inconsistency, it is uncertain whether CER truly is retained in nonspecific tissues for a prolonged period of time, since it is unlikely that the physiological differences between tumors would affect nontarget drug disposition.</p><p>Nevertheless, not only do the results demonstrate that nanoparticle delivery enhances tumor accumulation of drugs, supporting the well-known characteristic of nanoparticle tumor targeting by the EPR effect, but more importantly, the results demonstrate the effect that MDR tumor physiology may have on drug disposition at the target site despite EPR targeting. This knowledge could help factor into the design of nanoparticle platforms to enhance tumor targeting even in the presence of physiological barriers such as the presence of P-glycoprotein.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Long-circulating PEO-modified nanoparticles have been shown to accumulate preferentially in the solid tumor upon systemic administration. In this study, we have examined the delivery of combination PTX and CER to modulate the apoptotic threshold in tumor MDR by formulating both of these drugs in a single PLGA/PbAE (70:30 by weight) blend nanoparticles. When administered in an orthotopic (drug sensitive) MCF7 and multidrug resistant MCF7<sub>TR</sub> human breast adenocarcinoma model established in the mammary pad of female <italic>nu/nu</italic> mice, the nanoparticle-mediated delivery enhanced circulating times <italic>in vivo</italic> and allowed passive targeting to the tumor mass. The pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a trend for nanoparticle-mediated delivery of PTX toward the reduced clearance of the drug from the systemic circulation and tumor mass. We anticipate that the decreased PTX clearance would have significant implication in the treatment of MDR tumors. Overall, these results are encouraging for the development of multifunctional nanoparticle systems that can deliver combination therapy for synergistic effects, especially in refractory diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the Nanotechnology Platform Partnership grant (R01-CA119617) from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
