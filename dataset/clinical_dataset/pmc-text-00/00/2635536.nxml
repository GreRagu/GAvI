Each CS comprised two visual dimensions, colour                        and form.

Studies in experimental animals have                demonstrated that stimuli that are repeatedly associated with reward, termed                conditioned stimuli (CS+), are able to elicit phasic dopamine firing in the midbrain                when presented alone, while stimuli that do not predict reward (CS&#x02212;) do                not elicit such a response (Schultz <italic>et al.</italic>                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref036">1997</xref>). Presentation of a CS+ has also been                shown to increase the speed of responding relative to the presentation of a                CS&#x02212;, an effect that is modulated by ventral striatal dopamine (Wyvell                &#x00026; Berridge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref048">2000</xref>). This effect has                been interpreted as reflecting adaptive &#x02018;motivational salience&#x02019;,                meaning that a neutral stimulus becomes imbued with an emotional quality due to its                association with primary reinforcement, and consequently can influence behaviour and                command attention (Berridge &#x00026; Robinson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref007">1998</xref>; Milstein &#x00026; Dorris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref030">2007</xref>).</p><p>A number of theorists have hypothesized that positive psychotic symptoms may be                related to abnormal learning of stimulus&#x02013;reinforcement associations (King                    <italic>et al.</italic>                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref024">1984</xref>; Miller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref029">1993</xref>; Shaner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref038">1999</xref>). Most recently, Kapur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref023">2003</xref>)                proposed that the positive symptoms of schizophrenia may arise out of &#x02018;the                aberrant assignment of salience to external objects and internal                representations&#x02019;, and that antipsychotic medications reduce positive                symptoms, by attenuating aberrant motivational salience, via blockade of the                dopamine D2 receptor. A corollary of this is that antipsychotic medications will                also necessarily attenuate adaptive motivational salience, that is the correct                assignment of salience. This may result not only in positive symptom remission, but                also negative side-effects related to loss of motivation, such as apathy and                anhedonia.</p><p>Despite the implications for understanding the neurobiological basis of                schizophrenia, few studies have investigated reward learning in schizophrenia.                Studies investigating Pavlovian conditioning in medicated patients found a deficit                in learning stimulus&#x02013;reinforcement associations (Garmezy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref014">1952</xref>; Cohen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref010">1956</xref>; Waltz <italic>et al.</italic>                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref043">2007</xref>) and reduced ventral striatal                responses to CS+ predictive of monetary reward (Juckel <italic>et al.</italic>                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref022">2006</xref>). A recent study reported that                medicated patients with delusions were not only impaired at learning the predictive                value of a CS+ associated with an aversive noise, but also showed a tendency towards                higher galvanic skin responses, uneasiness ratings and haemodynamic response in the                ventral striatum following the presentation of a neutral stimulus (Jensen <italic>et                    al.</italic>                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref020">2008</xref>), consistent with aberrant salience                hypothesis.</p><p>In order to extend these findings, here we employed a novel paradigm, the Salience                Attribution Test (SAT), to quantify adaptive and aberrant salience in patients with                schizophrenia and controls. It has been hypothesized that dopamine antagonists                reduce both adaptive and aberrant salience, and that in the absence of effective                treatment patients with schizophrenia exhibit aberrant salience (Kapur, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref023">2003</xref>). Therefore, our first prediction was                that that medicated patients with schizophrenia would exhibit reduced adaptive                salience relative to controls, representing an undesirable side-effect of                anti-psychotic medication. Our second prediction was that medicated patients with                schizophrenia would exhibit equivalent aberrant salience to controls, representing                the beneficial effect of anti-psychotic medication, which is hypothesized to                normalize aberrant salience from a previously elevated level (Kapur, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref023">2003</xref>). Our third prediction was that those                patients with persistent positive symptoms, in whom medication is not entirely                effective, would exhibit greater aberrant salience than patients without positive                symptoms. Our fourth prediction was that in the controls, individual differences in                aberrant salience would be related to the personality trait of schizotypy,                considered to be an index of psychosis proneness (Chapman <italic>et al.</italic>                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref008">1994</xref>; Claridge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref009">1994</xref>; Stefanis <italic>et al.</italic>                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref041">2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec002" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec002-001"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty patients were recruited from a prospective, longitudinal study of                    first-episode psychosis in West London, UK (Joyce <italic>et al.</italic>                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref021">2005</xref>).

Two practice sessions were embedded into the                    tutorial to familiarize participants with the test and provide a measure of                    baseline response time (RT). On these practice sessions, a fixation cross                    appeared at the beginning of each trial.

Feedback was provided                    after 2&#x000a0;s as &#x02018;Good&#x02019; if the participant responded                    before the box disappeared, &#x02018;Try to respond faster&#x02019; if they                    responded after the box disappeared, &#x02018;Too early&#x02019; if they                    responded before the box appeared, and &#x02018;No key pressed&#x02019; if                    they did not make a response. On the second practice session, the mean probe                    duration was set to be the mean RT from the first, ensuring participants were                    responding as quickly as possible and to yoke task difficulty to individual                    performance. The standard deviation (<sc>s.d</sc>.) of the fastest half of the                    trials (SDF) was also calculated, and was used to set the minimum and maximum                    probe durations for the second practice session (mean from first practice                    session&#x000b1;2&#x000d7;SDF). For the main test, the mean, minimum and                    maximum probe durations were calculated from the second practice session in the                    same way. No monetary reinforcement was provided during the practice sessions.</p><p>Participants then completed two blocks of 64 trials on the main test, where money                    was available on 50% of trials. The likelihood that money was available on a                    trial was signalled by one of four CS that appeared at the top and bottom of the                    screen before the onset of the probe. CSs varied on two different visual                    dimensions: colour (blue or red) and shape (animal or household object).                    Therefore, there were four different types of CS: blue animals; red animals;                    blue household objects and red household objects. One of these dimensions (e.g.                    colour) was task-relevant so that one level of the dimension was reinforced on                    28 out of 32 (87.5%) of the trials while only four out of 32 (12.5%) trials of                    the other were reinforced. For example, if &#x02018;colour&#x02019; was the                    reinforced dimensions, 14 out of 16 blue animals and 14 out of 16 blue household                    objects would be reinforced, compared with only two out of 16 red animals and                    two out of 16 red household objects. The other dimension, in this example                    &#x02018;shape&#x02019;, was task-irrelevant, so that 16 out of 32 (50%) of                    both levels were reinforced. The contingencies were identical on the first and                    second blocks of the game. Participants were not informed of these                    contingencies, but instead learned them over the course of the game.</p><p>At the beginning of each trial a fixation cross appeared; after 1000&#x000a0;ms,                    while the fixation cross remained on-screen, one of the four CSs was displayed                    at the top and bottom of the screen and remained on-screen until the end of the                    trial. After a variable period of time (between 0.5 and 1.5&#x000a0;s) the                    probe appeared and participants attempted to respond before it disappeared. The                    probe duration was calculated according to the participant's responses on the                    second practice block, as described above. After 2.25&#x000a0;s, auditory and                    visual feedback was presented for 1.5&#x000a0;s (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig001">Fig. 1</xref>). Four different versions of the SAT were used,                    each with a different stimulus feature (blue, red, animal or household object)                    reinforced with high probability. Each participant was administered the same                    version for both blocks of the SAT.</p><p>If the trial was not reinforced, the message                    &#x02018;Sorry&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;no money available&#x02019; was                    displayed. If the trial was reinforced, participants won between 5 and 100                    pence, depending on the latency of their response. On reinforced trials where                    participants either made no response or responded after the probe had                    disappeared, the message &#x02018;Missed: 5 pence&#x02019; was displayed. If                    participants responded prematurely (&#x0003c;100&#x000a0;ms after the onset of                    the probe), the message displayed was &#x02018;Too early: 5 pence&#x02019;.                    On reinforced trials where participants responded before the probe disappeared,                    but slower than their mean RT, the message                    &#x02018;Hit&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;good: 10 pence&#x02019; was                    displayed. When participants responded more quickly than their mean RT, the                    message &#x02018;Quick&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;very good: X                    pence&#x02019; was displayed (for responses up to 1.5 SDFs faster than their                    mean RT) and &#x02018;Very quick&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;excellent: X                    pence&#x02019; (for responses faster than their mean RT by at least 1.5 SDFs).                    The reward was scaled according to X=10+90&#x000d7;(mean                    RT&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;trial RT)/(3&#x000d7;SDF), up to a maximum of                    100 pence. For example, a response 1 SDF faster than the mean was reinforced                    with 40 pence, a response 2 SDFs faster was reinforced with 70 pence, and any                    responses 3 SDFs or faster than the mean were reinforced with 100 pence. The                    money won on each trial was added to the participant's running total for that                    block, Y, which was displayed underneath the feedback:                    &#x02018;Total&#x000a0;&#x02013;&#x000a0;&#x000a3;Y&#x02019;. On                    reinforced trials, a 0.5&#x000a0;s tone sounded, frequency:                    (300+(10&#x000d7;X)) Hz. At the end of each block, participants indicated,                    using 10&#x000a0;mm visual analogue scales (VAS), their estimate of the                    reinforcement probabilities for each of the four different CSs.</p><p>Two measures of motivational salience were calculated for each block. Adaptive                    salience was defined in two ways (behaviourally or implicit and subjectively or                    explicit). RT adaptive salience (implicit) was defined as the speeding of                    responses on high-probability-reinforcement trials relative to                    low-probability-reinforcement trials (collapsing across the task-irrelevant                    stimulus dimension), and VAS adaptive salience (explicit) was defined as the                    increase in probability rating for high-probability-reinforcement trials                    relative to low-probability reinforcement trials (again, collapsing across the                    task-irrelevant stimulus dimension). Aberrant salience was defined as the                    absolute difference in RT (implicit) or VAS rating (explicit) between the two                    levels of the task-irrelevant stimulus dimension (collapsing across the                    task-relevant stimulus dimension). Since aberrant salience is defined as any                    deviation from equal reaction time or subjective reinforcement probability                    rating for the two levels of the task-irrelevant stimulus dimension, the sign is                    unimportant. Therefore aberrant salience was always positive, whereas adaptive                    salience could be positive or negative. The number of premature responses and                    omissions were also recorded for each stimulus type on each block.</p></sec><sec id="sec002-003"><title>Other cognitive tests</title><p>To assess whether any abnormalities on the SAT might be related to neurocognitive                    impairments in the patient group, pre-morbid IQ was estimated using the Wechsler                    Test of Adult Reading (WTAR; Wechsler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref045">2001</xref>) and working memory with the forwards and backwards digit-span                    (Wechsler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref044">1981</xref>).

If phasic dopamine release signals reinforcement prediction errors, any large                    stochastic fluctuation in dopamine release may disrupt learning about                    stimulus&#x02013;reinforcement associations, generating a state in which                    motivational salience could be misattributed to neutral stimuli, or what might                    be termed a &#x02018;false-positive&#x02019; phasic dopamine signal; such                    events have been proposed to result in positive symptoms (Kapur, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref023">2003</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, patients for whom medication had effectively eliminated                    positive symptoms actually exhibited significantly less aberrant salience than                    controls, supporting the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of antipsychotic                    medications on positive symptoms are related to their ability to dampen-down                    aberrant salience (Kapur, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref023">2003</xref>).                    However, independent of symptoms at the time of testing, the patients with                    schizophrenia exhibited significantly less adaptive salience than controls.                    Antipsychotic medication has long been considered to exacerbate negative                    symptoms in schizophrenia, which may be related to reduced adaptive salience                    [see discussion below and Schooler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref034">1994</xref>) ]. Our findings support the suggestion of Kapur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref023">2003</xref>) that this may be a necessary                    corollary to the beneficial effect of antipsychotic medication on positive                    symptoms.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that antipsychotic medication does not necessarily                    normalize abnormal dopamine signalling in psychotic patients. For example,                    functional neuroimaging studies have shown dopamine dysregulation in both                    medicated and unmedicated patients (Hietala <italic>et al.</italic>                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref017">1995</xref>; Abi-Dargham, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref001">2004</xref>; McGowan <italic>et al.</italic>                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref028">2004</xref>). Therefore persistent symptoms                    in medicated patients might still be related to aberrant salience. Furthermore,                    the only other study investigating stimulus&#x02013;reinforcement learning for                    appetitive outcomes in psychosis found that both medicated and unmedicated                    patients responded more quickly to a CS&#x02212; than controls, a finding                    interpreted as aberrant salience (Murray <italic>et al.</italic>                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref031">2008</xref>). This study also reported that                    patients exhibited reduced haemodynamic correlates of reward prediction errors                    in the ventral striatum relative to controls, consistent with other findings in                    medicated patients (Juckel <italic>et al.</italic>                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref022">2006</xref>; Jensen <italic>et al.</italic>                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref020">2008</xref>). Nevertheless it will be                    important to confirm our findings in unmedicated patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec004-002"><title>Aberrant salience and negative symptoms of schizophrenia</title><p>Although positive symptoms were associated with increased aberrant salience, our                    data also suggest a link between aberrant salience and negative symptoms.                    Aberrant salience correlated not only with negative symptoms in the patients,                    but also with O-LIFE introvertive anhedonia, which relates to reduced interest                    and social withdrawal, in the controls. If dopamine transmission is dysregulated                    in psychosis (Abi-Dargham, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref001">2004</xref>), it                    is possible that &#x02018;false negatives&#x02019; in the phasic dopamine                    signal might occur, i.e. a reinforcement-related stimulus fails to elicit a                    sufficiently large phasic dopamine response. False negatives would decrease the                    value of motivationally salient stimuli, possibly leading to symptoms such as                    avolition, apathy and social withdrawal. Consistent with this explanation, other                    studies that investigated responses to emotionally salient images in medicated                    patients with schizophrenia reported decreased responding for (Heerey &#x00026;                    Gold, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref016">2007</xref>) and ventral striatal                    responses to (Taylor <italic>et al.</italic>                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref042">2005</xref>) positive emotional stimuli                    relative to controls.</p><p>This explanation is also consistent with data from a functional magnetic                    resonance imaging study investigating the effects of d-amphetamine on reward                    processing in healthy volunteers. Knutson <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref025">2004</xref>) found that amphetamine                    administration paradoxically decreased the magnitude of phasic ventral striatal                    haemodynamic responses in response to a CS+ that signalled reward (i.e.                    increasing the potential for a false negative). In the same study, amphetamine                    administration caused significant phasic haemodynamic responses in the ventral                    striatum following CS+ that signalled potential monetary loss, an effect that                    was absent under placebo, possibly reflecting a loss of specificity of dopamine                    signalling (i.e. increasing the potential for a false positive). The aberrant                    salience model might therefore explain both positive and negative symptoms by                    appealing to a common neurobiological mechanism, namely a loss of signal:noise                    ratio in the mesolimbic dopamine system, possibly as a result of increased tonic                    dopamine activity (Grace, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref015">1991</xref>;                    Winterer &#x00026; Weinberger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref046">2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec004-003"><title>Study limitations and potential improvements</title><p>Though these results broadly support the aberrant salience hypothesis, some                    limitations of the study merit comment. We tested a relatively small sample of                    patients with schizophrenia and performed multiple statistical comparisons,                    raising the likelihood of type I error. Therefore, these results should be                    treated with caution until replicated. Further, it is possible that the finding                    of reduced adaptive salience in the patients might simply reflect a learning                    deficit independent of reward, or perhaps a difficulty in using informative cues                    to guide speeded responses (Robbins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref033">2005</xref>), which could be related either to the illness or the effects of                    antipsychotic medication (Pessiglione <italic>et al.</italic>                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref032">2006</xref>). However, such explanations                    cannot explain differences in our measure of aberrant salience between symptom                    subgroups, or the correlation with schizotypy in the healthy volunteers.</p><p>It is possible that the differences in aberrant salience between the patients                    with and without delusions might also be explained by non-specific cognitive                    impairments in symptomatic patients, since such impairments might result in a                    failure to understand the task, difficulty in representing probabilities or a                    general tendency to respond more randomly. However, we consider this explanation                    unlikely for two reasons. First, the patients with and without delusions did not                    differ in terms of VAS adaptive salience, suggesting that they were equally able                    to learn and report the difference in reinforcement probability between the two                    levels of the task-relevant stimulus dimension, albeit to a lesser extent than                    controls. Second, the patients with and without delusions performed similarly on                    WTAR IQ, forwards and the backwards digit-span tasks and the Beads Task, making                    an explanation in terms of non-specific deficits less likely.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Summary</title><p>In summary, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that schizophrenia patients                with delusions exhibit aberrant salience. However, negative symptoms were also                correlated with our measures of both adaptive and aberrant salience. The aberrant                salience hypothesis warrants further investigation in unmedicated patients with                schizophrenia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work was done at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of                Neurology (London, UK).
