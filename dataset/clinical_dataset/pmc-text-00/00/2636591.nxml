Nevertheless, the health effects of exposure of humans and other species to metallic oxide nanoparticles have not been systematically investigated as their impact on the environment has not been under the scrutiny of regulatory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijn-3-533">Oberdorster et al 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijn-3-533">Lai et al 2007b</xref>).</p><p>Titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) has been increasingly employed in a variety of industrial applications including production of paper, plastics, cosmetics, and paints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijn-3-533">Wang et al 2007</xref>) and TiO<sub>2</sub> micro- and nanoparticles were classified as comparatively inert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijn-3-533">Chen and Fayerweather 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ijn-3-533">Bernard et al 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijn-3-533">Hart and Hesterberg 1998</xref>). These ubiquitous applications lead to increasing human exposure to these nanoparticles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijn-3-533">Garabrant and colleagues (1987)</xref> noted that pleural disease was present in 17% of the workers exposed to TiO<sub>2</sub> and was associated with the duration of work in titanium manufacturing, even though the health risk resulting from this increased exposure to such nanoparticles both in natural as well as industrial environments has not been comprehensively or systematically assessed. Nevertheless, recent <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in animals have pointed to the possibilities that inhalation and other lung exposure to TiO<sub>2</sub> particles can induce inflammatory responses in lung tissue and even cytotoxicity in lung cells although the degree of inflammatory responses and cytotoxicity elicited depends critically on particle size and its surface chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijn-3-533">Rehn et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijn-3-533">Dick et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijn-3-533">Renwick et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ijn-3-533">Warheit et al 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijn-3-533">Monteiller et al 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijn-3-533">Warheit et al 2007</xref>). However, these criteria are still somewhat controversial and remain to be resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ijn-3-533">Renwick et al 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijn-3-533">Rehn et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijn-3-533">Monteiller et al 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijn-3-533">Warheit et al 2007</xref>).</p><p>The few studies on the cytotoxic effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles on human cell types have been mainly focused on lung or related epithelial cells. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijn-3-533">Stearns and colleagues (2001)</xref> demonstrated human epithelial A549 cells were able to take up TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (50 nm diameter) by endocytosis when exposed to them at 40 &#x003bc;g/mL. Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijn-3-533">Singh and colleagues (2007)</xref> found that these human lung epithelial (A549) cells could take up a range of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (20&#x02013;300 nm) and exposure to these nanoparticles triggered inflammatory responses from the cells. In parallel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijn-3-533">Monteiller and colleagues (2007)</xref> noted similar inflammatory responses elicited from A549 cells by exposure to TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and exposure to TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles also induced dose-related apoptotic damage in such cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijn-3-533">Park et al 2007</xref>). Furthermore, anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were more cytotoxic than rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles to the A549 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijn-3-533">Sayes et al 2006</xref>). Exposure of BEAS-2B cells, another human bronchial epithelial cell line, to TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles likewise resulted in oxidative damage to those cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijn-3-533">Gurr et al 2005</xref>). Furthermore, exposure to TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (&#x0003c;100 nm in diameter) induced genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in cultured human lymphoblastoid (WIL2-NS) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijn-3-533">Wang et al 2007</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the findings of effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles on human lung epithelial cells are the limited investigation employing non-human mammalian cells. Exposure of Syrian hamster embryo fibroblasts to ultrafine TiO<sub>2</sub> particles (&#x02264;20 nm) resulted in micronuclei and apoptosis in those cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijn-3-533">Rahman et al 2002</xref>) and TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (40 nm) also induced cytotoxicity in rat liver cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijn-3-533">Hussain et al 2005</xref>).

Astrocytes form end-feet around the brain capillary endothelium, which is the main cellular component of the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijn-3-533">Ballabh et al 2004</xref>). Thus, metallic oxide nanoparticles could reach the brain via these two routes.

Thus, the bright field microscopy data are consistent with cell survival data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-3-533">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that when U87 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of TiO<sub>2</sub>- microparticles or nanoparticles, there was a progressive decrease in the number of live U87 cells.</p><p>As noted under fluorescence microscopy, there were very few control (ie untreated) U87 cells stained with PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-3-533">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that there were very few necrotic cells among the population of untreated U87 cells examined. After U87 cells had been treated with progressively increased concentrations of TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles (1, 10, or 50 &#x003bc;g/mL) for 48 hours, the number of cells stained with PI progressively increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-3-533">Figures 5B&#x02013;5D</xref>), suggesting that the number of necrotic cells increased with increases in treatment levels. Similarly, the number of cells stained with PI likely progressively increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-3-533">Figures 5E&#x02013;5G</xref>) with increases in the treatment level of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (1, 10, or 50 &#x003bc;g/mL for 48 hours) although the effects of the nanoparticles were somewhat less marked than those of the microparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-3-533">Figures 5B&#x02013;5D</xref>). It should be pointed out that we noticed that both TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles and nanoparticles interacted with the PI dye to yield some fluorescence in the absence of U87 cells, although their fluorescence was minimal (data not shown) compared those noted in the treated cells.</p><p>As observed under fluorescence microscopy, very few control (ie, untreated) U87 cells were stained with Annexin-V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-3-533">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating that there were very few apoptotic cells within that population. After U87 cells had been treated with progressively increased concentrations of TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles (1, 10, or 50 &#x003bc;g/mL) for 48 hours, the number of cells stained with Annexin-V progressively increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-3-533">Figures 6B&#x02013;6D</xref>), suggesting that the number of apoptotic cells increased with increases in treatment levels. It is interesting to note that not all the treated cells showed uniformed staining although the staining intensity increased as the treatment level increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-3-533">Figures 6B&#x02013;6D</xref>) suggesting that the microparticle-induced apoptosis was not synchronized in those populations of U87 cells. Similarly, after U87 cells had been treated with progressively increased concentrations of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (1, 10, or 50 &#x003bc;g/mL) for 48 hours, the number of cells stained with Annexin-V progressively increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-3-533">Figures 6E&#x02013;6G</xref>), suggesting that the number of apoptotic cells increased with increases in treatment levels. However, the level of Annexin-V staining in the nanoparticles-treated cells was less marked compared to those in cells treated with corresponding levels of microparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-3-533">Figures 6B&#x02013;6D</xref>). Again, we noticed that both TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles and nanoparticles interacted with the Annexin-V dye to yield some fluorescence in the absence of U87 cells, although their fluorescence was minimal (data not shown). Furthermore, it was interesting to observe that many U87 cells treated with TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles or nanoparticles stained with Annexin-V also co-stained with PI (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-3-533">Figures 5 and 6</xref>) while in the same field there were few treated cells that stained only with Annexin-V or PI, suggesting either apoptosis and necrosis mechanisms were co-occurring in those cells or those cells exhibited another cell death mechanism that shares some common features with apoptosis and necrosis (ie, hybrid mechanism; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijn-3-533">Br&#x000f6;ker et al 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijn-3-533">Wei et al 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijn-3-533">Golstein and Kroemer 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge our studies are the first to demonstrate the cytotoxic effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> micro- and nanoparticles on human neural cells (namely U87 astrocytoma cells) and to compare those effects with the effects of ZnO and MgO nanoparticles on the same cell type. At the same time we also contrasted the cytotoxic effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> micro- and nanoparticles on human U87 cells (astrocytes-like) and on normal human fibroblasts (HFF-1 cells). Furthermore, we have also determined the cell death mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> micro- and nanoparticles on U87 cells. We found that TiO<sub>2</sub> micro- and nanoparticles appeared to induce U87 cells to undergo both apoptosis and necrosis or a cell death mechanism that may contain features of both apoptosis and necrosis (see below).</p><p>Because the putative cytotoxic effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> micro- and nanoparticles on human cells (especially human neural cells) have not been systematically elucidated, with the exception of human lung epithelial (A549) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijn-3-533">Stearns et al 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijn-3-533">Singh et al 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijn-3-533">Monteiller et al 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijn-3-533">Park et al 2007</xref>), we have examined the effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> micro- and nanoparticles on human astrocytoma (astrocytes-like) U87 cells and normal human fibroblasts (HFF-1 cells) employing the MTT cell survival assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijn-3-533">Lai et al 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijn-3-533">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijn-3-533">Malthankar et al 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijn-3-533">Puli et al 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijn-3-533">Dukhande et al 2006</xref>). Our results demonstrate that in a concentration range similar to those employed in human lung (A549) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijn-3-533">Stearns et al 2001</xref>), treatment of human astrocytoma (astrocytes-like) U87 cells with TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles or nanoparticles at levels higher than 1 &#x003bc;g/mL for 48 hours induced a concentration-related lowering of cell survival, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 30&#x02013;40 &#x003bc;g/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-3-533">Figure 1</xref>). At the highest level of both TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles and nanoparticles investigated (ie, 100 &#x003bc;g/mL), the survival of U87 cells decreased to less than 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-3-533">Figure 1</xref>). Similarly, exposure of normal human fibroblasts (HFF-1 cells) to both TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles and nanoparticles in the same concentration range also induced a dose-related decrease in cell survival, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of ~40 &#x003bc;g/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-3-533">Figure 3</xref>) although at the lower concentration range of 1 to 10 &#x003bc;g/mL, TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were more effective than the microparticles in lowering the survival of human fibroblasts (HFF-1 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-3-533">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that both TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles and nanoparticles, despite the difference in their sizes, are equally effective in inducing cell death in human neural (ie, U87) cells and normal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-3-533">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-3-533">3</xref>). While the cytotoxic effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles and nanoparticles on human cell types other than those discussed above are largely unknown, there is one study noting that exposure to TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in human lymphoblastoid (WIL2-NS) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijn-3-533">Wang et al 2007</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijn-3-533">Hussain and colleagues (2005)</xref> reported TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles induced cytotoxicity in rat liver cells.</p><p>As far as we are aware, we are also the first to compare the cytotoxic effects of metallic oxide nanoparticles of essential metals (namely zinc and magnesium) with those of a nonessential metal (ie, Ti) on human neural (namely U87 astrocytoma) cells. It is interesting to note that of the three metallic oxide nanoparticles, ZnO nanoparticles were the most effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-3-533">Figure 3</xref>), TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were the next most effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-3-533">Figure 1</xref>), and MgO nanoparticles the least effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-3-533">Figure 3</xref>) in inducing cell death in U87 cells. In this context, it is relevant to observe that, in contrast with their effect on human neural U87 cells, ZnO nanoparticles (~13 nm) are not effective in lowering the survival of primary human T cells at concentrations &#x02264;5 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijn-3-533">Reddy et al 2007</xref>). Clearly, additional work is required to further elucidate the cytotoxic effects of ZnO and other metallic oxide nanoparticles on these and other human cell types.</p><p>Because cell death mechanisms underlying the effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles and nanoparticles on neural cells are unknown, we have investigated these putative mechanisms in human astrocytoma (astrocytes-like) U87 cells. We found that a fraction of U87 cells treated with TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles or nanoparticles showed Annexin-V staining, a marker of apoptosis, and the cellular staining was increased with increases in the treatment concentrations of the microparticles or nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-3-533">Figure 6</xref>). This finding indicates that treatment of U87 cells with either TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles or nanoparticles, irrespective of their sizes, induces apoptosis in those cells: this observation is consistent with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijn-3-533">Park and colleagues (2007)</xref> who showed that treatment of human lung epithelial (A549) cells with TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles induce dose-related apoptotic damage in those cells.</p><p>In our studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-3-533">Figure 5</xref>), we also noted that a fraction of U87 cells treated with TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles or nanoparticles showed PI staining, a marker of necrosis, and the cellular staining was increased with increases in the treatment concentrations of the microparticles or nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-3-533">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, this observation demonstrates that treatment with TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles or nanoparticles also induces necrotic cell death in human neural (ie, U87) cells. However, a third and larger fraction of U87 cells treated with TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles or nanoparticles showed co-staining with both PI and Annexin-V (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-3-533">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-3-533">6</xref>). There are several mechanistic explanations to account for the co-staining of PI and Annexin-V in the treated U87 cells. (i) Both apoptosis and necrosis could be co-occurring in the U87 cells treated with TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles or nanoparticles. Co-existence of apoptosis and necrosis in neural cells is known to occur: for example, in the developing brain, focal ischemia induces cell death with overt apoptotic characteristics co-existing with some features of necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijn-3-533">Wei et al 2006</xref>). (ii) Paraptosis, a new type of cell death independent of caspases (Sperandio et al 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijn-3-533">Br&#x000f6;ker et al 2005</xref>), could occur in the U87 cells treated with TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles or nanoparticles because paraptotic cells are stained with PI (Sperandio et al 2000). (iii) The apoptosis-like and necrosis-like programmed cell death as postulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijn-3-533">Br&#x000f6;ker and colleagues (2005)</xref> could occur in the U87 cells treated with TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles or nanoparticles because of our observation that the cells were co-stained with PI and Annexin-V, yet the lactate dehydrogenase release from such cells were minimal (see Results section above). (iv) There remains the possibility that we may be encountering a totally new mode of cell death mechanism in the U87 cells treated with TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles or nanoparticles. After all, it has become increasingly clear that the &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; distinction of three cell death types &#x02013; type I (apoptosis), type II (autophagy), and type III (necrosis) &#x02013; is inadequate to account for all the observed phenomena of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijn-3-533">Br&#x000f6;ker et al 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijn-3-533">Golstein and Kroemer 2007</xref>). Consequently, only additional studies will elucidate as to which of the cell death mechanisms proposed above can accurately depict the mechanisms induced in U87 cells by treatment with TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles or nanoparticles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Conclusion and implications</title><p>Our studies are the first to demonstrate that exposure of human neural (ie, astrocytoma U87) cells to TiO<sub>2</sub> micro- and nanoparticles induces a concentration-related increases in cell death in this cell type. We also found similar dose-related effects of these micro- and nanoparticles in inducing cell death in normal human fibroblasts (HFF-1 cells). In comparing the effects of metallic oxide nanoparticles of essential metals (ie, ZnO and MgO) and nonessential metals (ie, TiO<sub>2</sub>), we noted ZnO nanoparticles are the most effective, TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles the second most effective, and MgO nanoparticles the least effective in inducing decreases in survival of human neural (ie astrocytoma U87) cells.</p><p>We observed that treatment of human astrocytoma (astrocytes-like) U87 cells with TiO<sub>2</sub> microparticles or nanoparticles induces several modes of cell death in these cells, including apoptosis, necrosis, and possibly a &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; type of cell death that is apoptosis-like and necrosis-like. Thus, these interesting phenomena merit further investigation to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms.</p><p>As alluded to above, the industrial use of metallic oxide nanoparticles (including those of TiO<sub>2</sub>) in wide diversity of applications has been expanding exponentially, leading to increasing occupational and other environmental exposure of these nanoparticles to human and other species. Because airborne toxic metallic substances can enter the brain directly via retrograde transport through the olfactory nerve into the rest of the brain and/or via transport across the blood-brain barrier, the results of our studies may have toxicological and other pathophysiological implications in exposure of human and other mammalian species to TiO<sub>2</sub> micro- and nanoparticles in particular, and to metallic oxide nanoparticles in general. Consequently, metallic oxides such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, that is used in dental and other implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ijn-3-533">Wennerberg et al 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijn-3-533">Rasmusson et al 2005</xref>) because the material appears to be biologically compatible, may not be as benign as one previously presupposed. Clearly, this area of nanotoxicity deserves further systematic investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Our studies were supported by an USAMRMC Project Grant
