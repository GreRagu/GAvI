Eukaryotic cells, however, have double membranes-bound organelles, such as the cell nucleus, mitochondrion, plastids and single-membrane-bound organelles such as ER, the Golgi body, vacuoles (lysosomes) and microbodies. Organelle proliferations, which are very important for cell functions, are poorly understood. To clarify this, we performed a microarray analysis during the cell cycle of <italic>Cyanidioschyzon merolae. C. merolae</italic> cells contain a minimum set of organelles that divide synchronously. The nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid genomes were completely sequenced. The results showed that, of 158 genes induced during the S or G2-M phase, 93 were known and contained genes related to mitochondrial division, <italic>ftsZ1-1</italic>, <italic>ftsz1-2</italic> and <italic>mda1</italic>, and plastid division, <italic>ftsZ2-1</italic>, <italic>ftsZ2-2</italic> and <italic>cmdnm2.</italic> Moreover, three genes, involved in vesicle trafficking between the single-membrane organelles such as <italic>vps29</italic> and the Rab family protein, were identified and might be related to partitioning of single-membrane-bound organelles. In other genes, 46 were hypothetical and 19 were hypothetical conserved. The possibility of finding novel organelle division genes from hypothetical and hypothetical conserved genes in the S and G2-M expression groups is discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>microarray</kwd><kwd>mitochondria&#x02013;plastid division genes</kwd><kwd>organelle division genes</kwd><kwd><italic>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell cycle progression is regulated and controlled by a range of mechanisms including protein modification, targeted proteolytic degradation and cell cycle-specific transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN032C1">1</xref></sup> Genes whose expression levels peak at a specific event of the cell cycle are often required to regulate the processes that occur at these stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN032C2">2</xref></sup> In the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, of &#x0223c;6000 genes, &#x0223c;400&#x02013;800 have transcript levels that oscillate during the cell cycle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN032C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN032C4">4</xref></sup> whereas in the fission yeast, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, of &#x0223c;5000 genes, &#x0223c;400&#x02013;750 such genes have been found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN032C5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN032C7">7</xref></sup> In human cancer cell line (HeLa), among a total of 22 000 genes, &#x0003e;1000 are regulated by the cell cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN032C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN032C9">9</xref></sup> These studies of periodic genes suggest that only the 112th orthologue group is cyclic and common among human cells, as well as budding and fission yeast cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN032C10">10</xref></sup> Those taking part in the cell cycle progression include the <italic>cyclin</italic> B homologs, CDC5, SCH9, DSK2 and ZPR1.

An increase in cell nuclear volume in the S-phase occurred from 12 to 15 h and from 31 to 34 h, and the cell nuclear division period (M-phase) occurred from 17 to 21 h and 35.5 to 38 h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN032F2">2</xref>C).</p><fig id="DSN032F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Scattered plot of transcriptional levels at 14 and 22 h in microarray analysis.

The S and G2-M groups comprised a total of 158 genes including 93 known, 46 hypothetical and 19 hypothetical conserved genes. The hypothetical and hypothetical conserved genes were unknown, and searched for using BlastP, CDs: <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi</uri> and SMART: <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/">http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/</uri> (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DSN032TB1">1</xref>). The hypothetical genes were specific to <italic>C. merolae</italic>, the hypothetical conserved had a conserved domain that had significant hits on genes in other organisms. Therefore, the 19 hypothetical conserved genes were good candidates for novel organelle division genes because they are possible for analyzing organelle division in eukaryotes. We grouped candidate genes with known genes into the S, G2 and M phases to show a tendency of function and localization by the phase of expression peaks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN032F4">4</xref>). Genes involved in the cell nucleus were widely found among the S-, G2- and M-phase groups. The S-phase group included genes related to DNA replication, and G2- and M-phase groups included genes related to chromosome segregation and organization. The genes involved in mitochondria and plastids were mainly contained in the S group. This suggested that candidate genes contained in the S group were more related to division of organelles such as mitochondria and plastids. In the candidate, 11, 3 and 5 genes were contained in the S, G2 and M groups, respectively. Therefore, 11 genes in the S group might be more related to organelle division, while the 3 and 5 genes in the G2 and M groups might be involved in cell nucleus division.</p><fig id="DSN032F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>The list of genes related to the function in cell nucleus and organelle, and unknown genes in the S-, G2- or M-phase groups.
