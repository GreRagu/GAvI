Following cleavage of the crosslinks and analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, it was found that the crosslinker increased the level of various proteins, and particularly actin, in this pellet fraction.

Introduction</title><p>The growth-associated protein GAP-43 participates in neuronal development and is also present in certain regions of the normal adult brain, retina, and cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijms-9-1753">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijms-9-1753">4</xref>]. During development and regeneration, axons must navigate correctly to their proper destination, and receptors on axonal growth cone filopodia bind various factors, including neurotrophins, netrins, semaphorins, ephrins, and slits, which results in the growth cone turning in the direction of the target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijms-9-1753">5</xref>]. GAP-43 is required in some way in this process, since retinal ganglion cell axons in mice that are deficient in this protein do not reach their target sites in the lateral geniculate nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijms-9-1753">6</xref>].</p><p>Proteasome digestion studies suggested that GAP-43 is primarily unfolded at physiological ionic strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-9-1753">7</xref>]. It is of interest how the protein might fold following its interaction with the membrane and with other proteins. GAP-43 becomes membrane-bound following its palmitoylation at Cys-3 and Cys-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ijms-9-1753">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijms-9-1753">9</xref>] and this appears to be followed by the interaction of Arg-6, Arg-7, Lys-9, and Lys-13 with the lipid bilayer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-1753">10</xref>]. The protein remains membrane-bound if the palmitates are removed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-1753">10</xref>]. Protein palmitoylation is associated with neuronal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijms-9-1753">11</xref>] and a decrease in GAP-43 palmitoylation occurs as growth stops and synapses are formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijms-9-1753">12</xref>]. NCAM (neural cell adhesion molecule)-mediated neurite outgrowth requires GAP-43 and causes the protein to be phosphorylated at Ser-41 by protein kinase C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-1753">13</xref>]. The increase in neuronal branching caused by the small GTPase Ral also results in the phosphorylation of GAP-43 by protein kinase C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-1753">14</xref>]. Ral is activated by laminin binding to integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijms-9-1753">14</xref>]. However, integrin-mediated outgrowth can also occur in the absence of GAP-43 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijms-9-1753">13</xref>].</p><p>It was suggested that GAP-43 might act by binding directly to F-actin, and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies demonstrated the binding of GAP-43 to existing F-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-9-1753">15</xref>] as well as binding when GAP-43 was present during actin polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-9-1753">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-9-1753">17</xref>]. In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments suggested that GAP-43 binds to spectrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijms-9-1753">18</xref>]. GAP-43 has also been shown to enhance the binding of GTP&#x003b3;S to the &#x003b1; subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein Go [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijms-9-1753">19</xref>]. GAP-43 has been proposed to bind directly to the synaptosomal associated protein SNAP-25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijms-9-1753">20</xref>] and to participate in endocytosis via a direct interaction with the Rab5 effector protein rabaptin-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijms-9-1753">21</xref>]. In contrast, a yeast two-hybrid system showed that unphosphorylated GAP-43 interacted strongly only with calmodulin and a mutant which mimicked GAP-43 phosphorylated at Ser-41 did not interact with actin or other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijms-9-1753">22</xref>]. GAP-43 binds to calmodulin <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijms-9-1753">23</xref>], in synaptosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijms-9-1753">24</xref>], and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijms-9-1753">25</xref>]. This interaction is eliminated following the phosphorylation of GAP-43 by protein kinase C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijms-9-1753">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijms-9-1753">25</xref>]. The same basic region in GAP-43 (residues 39&#x02013;56) that binds calmodulin has also been proposed to bind and sequester the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijms-9-1753">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ijms-9-1753">27</xref>].</p><p>The addition of a membrane permeable crosslinker to living, stimulated neurons is one approach to test for the direct interaction of GAP-43 with other proteins. In the present work crosslinking experiments, analyzed by immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional electrophoresis, were carried out on living, differentiated N1E-115 cells. It was found that GAP-43 did not sediment with crosslinked F-actin when crosslinker was added to these cells. It was also found that the crosslinker caused calmodulin, but not actin or other proposed interaction partners, to co-immunoprecipitate with GAP-43. Faint spots at 34 kDa and 60 kDa were also present in the immunoprecipitate when monoclonal anti-GAP-43 was used. The same results were obtained when cells were lysed in detergent prior to the addition of crosslinker, and GAP-43 did not sediment with the membrane skeleton when control or crosslinker-treated cells were lysed in nonionic detergent. The results suggest that the majority of GAP-43 in growing N1E-115 cells is not complexed to other proteins, but a small fraction of the total GAP-43 could nevertheless be involved in some protein-protein interactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results|discussion"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>2.1. Addition of DSP to living cells yields crosslinked complexes that will not enter a one-dimensional gel</title><p>The mouse neuroblastoma cell line N1E-115 was differentiated by the addition of 2% DMSO to the medium. After 4 days of this treatment, the cells displayed many neurites and growth cones. The membrane-permeable crosslinker dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) (DSP), when added to these cultures, crosslinked actin and other proteins into large complexes with molecular weights too great for them to be resolved by SDS-PAGE.</p><p>In the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-1753">Figure 1</xref>, differentiated N1E-115 cells were incubated with [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled methionine and cysteine. The labeled cells received either DMSO alone as a control or DSP at a final concentration of 1 mM. This was followed by lysing the cells with SDS, addition of buffer containing NP-40 substitute, and shearing the lysates through a needle. The lysates were not centrifuged and received either monoclonal anti-GAP-43 or monoclonal anti &#x003b2;-galactosidase as a control, followed by incubation with protein G-agarose. The samples were divided and the material bound to the protein G-agarose was analyzed by SDS/PAGE either without DTT (lanes 1&#x02013;4) or with DTT (lanes 5&#x02013;8). The addition of DSP to cells caused the formation of large crosslinked complexes that associated with the agarose. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-1753">Figure 1</xref> shows that mainly actin, seen at 45 kDa, entered the gel in the absence of DTT (lanes 3 and 4) and that much more actin was present, as well as tubulin (seen at 55 kDa) if DTT were present (lanes 7 and 8). Immunoprecipitated GAP-43 migrated at 43 kDa and can be faintly detected, after only a 1 h exposure of the gel, both in the absence (lane 2) and presence (lane 6) of DTT. Longer exposure times under these immunoprecipitation conditions clearly showed the protein on this film as well as on the films of two-dimensional gels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2</xref>. The addition of anti-&#x003b2;-galactosidase yielded no band that migrated at 43 kDa in either the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 5) of DTT. GAP-43 immunoprecipitation from DSP-treated cells could not be observed because of the high background seen in lanes 4 and 8.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2. Calmodulin, but not actin or other proposed interaction partners, co-immunoprecipitates with GAP-43 after addition of crosslinker to living cells</title><p>DMSO- and DSP-treated cells were lysed and sheared as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-1753">Figure 1</xref>, and the lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 &#x000d7; g. The supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2</xref>). Traces of actin and tubulin are present in the immunoprecipitates, which allowed these films to be precisely aligned with films of the pellet fractions seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-1753">Figure 3</xref>. Control immunoprecipitates using anti-&#x003b2;-galactosidase were negative at the position of GAP-43, using cells that were either treated with DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2a</xref>) or DSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2c</xref>). GAP-43 (marked with a G) was immunoprecipitated by monoclonal anti-GAP-43 from DMSO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2b</xref>) and from DSP-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2d</xref>). The acidic end of the gel is to the right for all two-dimensional gels. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2d</xref>, it is seen that DSP treatment of cells resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of calmodulin (marked with a C) with GAP-43. In DMSO-treated cells there was no co-immunoprecipitation of calmodulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2b</xref>), providing evidence that DSP caused the crosslinking of GAP-43 and calmodulin. By contrast, the level of actin (marked with an A) seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2d</xref> resembles the level of background actin seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figures 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">2c</xref>. These results suggest that no GAP-43/actin crosslinked complexes were immunoprecipitated. Two faint spots at 34 kDa and 60 kDa are present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2d</xref> that are not present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figures 2b</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">2c</xref>, and they are each marked with an arrow. The supernatant obtained following GAP-43 immunoprecipitation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2d</xref> received anti-calmodulin, and the resulting immunoprecipitate is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2e</xref>. Additional GAP-43 was recovered when this was done. The levels of background actin and other background proteins are higher in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2e</xref> than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2d</xref> because the film was exposed for a longer time.</p><p>Immunoprecipitation of GAP-43 from membrane fractions of rat cerebellum growth cones yielded co-immunoprecipitated Go&#x003b1;, but only after GTP&#x003b3;S treatment of the membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijms-9-1753">28</xref>]. Two isoforms of Go&#x003b1; are expressed in DMSO-differentiated N1E-115 cells, and they each have a molecular weight of 39 kDa and isoelectric points of 5.8 and 5.55, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijms-9-1753">29</xref>]. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2d</xref>, neither of these isoforms co-immunoprecipitated with GAP-43 following DSP treatment of cells. However, in the absence of crosslinker, a faint spot of about 40 kDa and with pI slightly more alkaline than &#x003b2;-actin (pI = 5.29) did appear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2b</xref>, and may represent co-immunoprecipitated Go&#x003b1;. This spot was absent from both the anti-&#x003b2;-galactosidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2a</xref>) and normal rabbit serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-1753">Figure 5a</xref>) controls. Proteins at the positions of the spectrin &#x003b1;-chain (285 kDa, pI = 5.21), spectrin &#x003b2;-chain (251 kDa, pI = 5.37), rabaptin-5 (99.5 kDa, pI = 4.97), and SNAP-25 (23 kDa, pI = 4.66) are resolvable by the two-dimensional gel system that was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijms-9-1753">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijms-9-1753">32</xref>] but did not co-immunoprecipitate with GAP-43 following DSP treatment of cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2d</xref> or in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-1753">Figures 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijms-9-1753">6b</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijms-9-1753">7b</xref>. It is important to consider if a 3 hour incubation with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine and [<sup>35</sup>S]-cysteine is sufficient to label all of these proteins. It has been shown that spectrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijms-9-1753">33</xref>], Rab5 effector proteins like rabenosyn-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijms-9-1753">31</xref>], and SNAP-25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijms-9-1753">32</xref>] all become labeled following the incubation of isolated cells with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine for 3 hours or less. A six hour incubation was used to label the two Go&#x003b1; isotypes with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine in differentiated N1E-115 cells and each protein was found to have a half-life of approximately 49 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijms-9-1753">29</xref>], which is similar to the average half-life for total cellular protein. These results suggest that the three hour incubation period used in the present work is sufficient to label these proteins, and that their lack of co-immunoprecipitation with GAP-43 following DSP treatment of cells is not due to their being insufficiently labeled.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3. GAP-43 does not appear in the 100,000 &#x000d7; g pellet fractions</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-1753">Figure 3</xref>, the 100,000 &#x000d7; g pellet fractions obtained above from DMSO- and DSP-treated cells were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The crosslinks were cleaved prior to electrophoresis by 2-mercaptoethanol, which was present in the sample buffer.</p><p>The same proteins are present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-1753">Figures 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-1753">3b</xref>, but they are present at a greater level in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-1753">Figure 3b</xref>, suggesting that crosslinking had occurred. Actin (marked with an A) is present at the highest level of any protein, both with and without DSP treatment. The migration of the proteins is altered slightly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-1753">Figure 3b</xref> because DSP neutralizes lysine residues and therefore causes a change in isoelectric points. The position of GAP-43 can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figures 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">2d</xref>, and based on this no trace of GAP-43 is present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-1753">Figure 3a</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-1753">Figure 3b</xref>. GAP-43 was readily detected on the film after a 1 h exposure of the gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-1753">Figure 1</xref>. A gel exposure of 4 h in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-1753">Figure 3b</xref> insures that the absence of GAP-43 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-1753">Figure 3b</xref> is not due to underexposure of the gel. GAP-43 therefore did not become crosslinked to actin or to any other protein present in this pellet fraction and did not sediment with them. The fact that actin and not tubulin is the crosslinking of microtubules when applied to cells at 1 mM. At this concentration the reagent may not penetrate to the cytoskeleton, where the microtubules are located, and may be consumed by reaction with F-actin and other membrane skeleton proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>2.4. Polyclonal anti-GAP-43 yields co-immunoprecipitated calmodulin but not actin following crosslinker treatment of cells</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-1753">Figure 4</xref>, the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2</xref> was repeated using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to GAP-43. No increase in the amount of actin in the immunoprecipitate is seen when cells are treated with DSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-1753">Figure 4b</xref>), compared with control cells treated with DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-1753">Figure 4a</xref>). Calmodulin (marked with a C) again co-immunoprecipitated with GAP-43 following DSP treatment of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-1753">Figure 4b</xref>), but is more faintly detected than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2d</xref>. The 60 kDa protein seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2d</xref> is not seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-1753">Figure 4b</xref>. The higher background in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijms-9-1753">Figure 4b</xref> also makes detection of the 34 kDa protein more difficult.</p></sec><sec><title>2.5. Quantitation of GAP-43 and calmodulin in immunoprecipitates</title><p>The GAP-43 and calmodulin spots were cut out of various gels, using the films as templates, followed by determination of the amount of radioactivity present. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-1753">Table 1</xref>. The values for calmodulin have been divided by 9/4 to reflect the fact that calmodulin has 9 methionines while mouse GAP-43 has 2 methionines and 2 cysteines. The amount of calmodulin present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2d</xref> is therefore 14% of the amount of GAP-43 present. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-1753">Table 1</xref> also shows that calmodulin represented 39% of the total GAP-43 when DSP was added to lysed cells. Comparing the data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2d</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2b</xref> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-1753">Table 1</xref> shows that 65% of the GAP-43 recovered in the control immunoprecipitate is recovered in the immunoprecipitate obtained from DSP-treated cells. This at first suggested that the missing 35% would be in the 100,000 g pellet, but it is not, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-1753">Figure 3b</xref>. Instead, additional GAP-43 was recovered by treating the supernatant obtained after GAP-43 immunoprecipitation with anti-calmodulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2e</xref>). However, when this amount of GAP-43 (322 cpm) was added, the total amount of GAP-43 recovered from DSP-treated cells was still only 76% of the GAP-43 obtained from DMSO-treated cells. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-1753">Table 1</xref> shows that the recovery of GAP-43 was also not complete when polyclonal anti-GAP-43 was used, with 78% of the GAP-43 being recovered following DSP treatment of cells. Two possibilities exist to explain these results. One is that DSP has altered GAP-43 so that immunoprecipitation is not quantitative with either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The other possibility is that neither antibody recognizes GAP-43 because it is crosslinked to actin or to some other protein. To distinguish between these possibilities, the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijms-9-1753">Figure 2e</xref> was repeated, using anti-actin instead of anti-calmodulin.</p></sec><sec><title>2.6.

It can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-1753">Figure 5b</xref> that actin was immunoprecipitated but there is no co-immunoprecipitated GAP-43. This result gives evidence that the lack of quantitative immunoprecipitation seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijms-9-1753">Table 1</xref> is not due to the presence of GAP-43/actin crosslinked complexes but may be due to an alteration of GAP-43 by DSP. The lack of quantitative immunoprecipitation being due to the crosslinking of GAP-43 to some protein besides actin cannot be ruled out by the experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijms-9-1753">Figure 5</xref>. Other proteins that might be interaction partners for actin are not present in the immunoprecipitate. One explanation is that any interaction partners that were crosslinked to F-actin sedimented and are present in the 100,000 &#x000d7; g pellet seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijms-9-1753">Figure 3b</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>2.7.

The nuclei and cytoskeleton were removed by low speed centrifugation, and supernatants received either DMSO as a control or DSP at a final concentration of 1 mM. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the unreacted DSP was quenched by the addition of glycine, and SDS was added at a final concentration of 0.1%. The lysates were then sheared through a needle and centrifuged at 100,000 &#x000d7; g for 1 h. Immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-GAP-43 was then carried out.

Addition of DSP to living cells caused an increase in the amount of actin sedimenting at 100,000 &#x000d7; g following SDS lysis and the addition of nonionic detergent, but no GAP-43 was found in this pellet fraction, indicating that GAP-43 did not become crosslinked to F-actin and did not sediment with it. GAP-43 was found in the 100,000 &#x000d7; g supernatant, but no co-immunoprecipitated actin was seen. Following nonionic detergent lysis of cells, GAP-43 was bound to the membrane skeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ijms-9-1753">34</xref>] and co-purified with membrane skeleton proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ijms-9-1753">35</xref>]. In the present work, GAP-43 did not sediment with the membrane skeleton following the lysis of DMSO- or DSP-treated cells with nonionic detergent.</p><p>Although GAP-43 binds to F-actin <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijms-9-1753">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijms-9-1753">17</xref>], it may be prevented from doing so in the cell. Actin filaments do not directly associate with the lipid bilayer, where palmitoylated proteins are located, but are attached indirectly by binding to other proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ijms-9-1753">36</xref>]. Filopodial actin filaments are parallel, unbranched, and linked together by fascin, and are thought to arise via the Arp2/3 complex from the meshwork of branched F-actin located in the lamellipodium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ijms-9-1753">37</xref>]. GAP-43 is present on the filopodial plasma membrane as well as at sites that are not filopodial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ijms-9-1753">38</xref>]. Evidence from proteasome attack suggested that GAP-43 is unfolded at physiological ionic strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijms-9-1753">7</xref>]. If GAP-43 (226 amino acids) is in an extended conformation and is completely unfolded in the cell, its total length would be 75 nm. Given the diameter of a typical filopodium as 78 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ijms-9-1753">39</xref>] and the fact that the N-terminal 14 residues of GAP-43 are attached to the lipid bilayer, the remaining length of GAP-43 could extend nearly the width of the filopodium. This suggests that some portions of GAP-43 might have access to filopodial F-actin. Intramolecular interactions could shorten GAP-43 and prevent this access. Interactions between the acidic C-terminal region and the basic region occur in full-length MARCKS (myistoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate), and this prevents the protein from interacting with actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ijms-9-1753">40</xref>]. Evidence for the intramolecular binding of the acidic C-terminal region of GAP-43 to the basic calmodulin-binding region has also been obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ijms-9-1753">41</xref>]. An alternative possibility is that the entire length of GAP-43 is adsorbed to the lipid bilayer by electrostatic interactions. In addition, GAP-43 does not leave the lipid bilayer following phosphorylation by protein kinase C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijms-9-1753">26</xref>] or when it is depalmitoylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijms-9-1753">10</xref>]. GAP-43 would therefore not re-enter the cytosol where G-actin is polymerizing and the ability of GAP-43 to act as a capping protein for F-actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijms-9-1753">16</xref>] would be limited by this membrane attachment. In agreement with the present results, GAP-43 could not be observed decorating actin filaments in immunostained neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijms-9-1753">26</xref>]. When a mutant GAP-43, in which Cys-3 and Cys-4 were replaced with glycine, was expressed in COS-7 cells, the protein showed a cytosolic distribution and did not bind to actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ijms-9-1753">42</xref>]. Finally, a 70 kDa GAP-43/calmodulin crosslinked complex was observed in nonreducing gels when DSP was added to unstimulated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijms-9-1753">25</xref>]. When crosslinker was added following the activation of protein kinase C and the release of GAP-43 from calmodulin, an increase rather than a decrease in the level of free GAP-43 in nonreducing gels was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijms-9-1753">25</xref>], which implies that GAP-43, once released from calmodulin, does not become crosslinked to actin or to other proteins. Bands were detected at 120 kDa following crosslinker addition which were GAP-43-positive and calmodulin-negative, and it was suggested that these bands represent a crosslinked complex containing actin and GAP-43, but no attempt was made to identify the bands with antibodies to actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijms-9-1753">25</xref>]. Following DSP treatment of cells, bands at 120 kDa were not observed in the nonreducing lanes of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijms-9-1753">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Calmodulin co-immunoprecipitated with GAP-43 following DSP treatment of cells and additional GAP-43 was recovered from the immunoprecipitation supernatant with anti-calmodulin. Combining these results indicates that approximately 25% of the total GAP-43 was crosslinked to calmodulin. The fact that the remainder of the GAP-43 was not crosslinked to calmodulin is consistent with the cells being in a stimulated, differentiated state. The calmodulin crosslinking is also consistent with the fact that both unphosphorylated GAP-43 and GAP-43 phosphorylated by protein kinase C can exist in the same stimulated neuron, with phosphorylated GAP-43 predominating at the growth cone and unphosphorylated GAP-43 being present in the cell body and proximal axon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ijms-9-1753">43</xref>]. Also co-immunoprecipitating with GAP-43 were proteins at 34 kDa and 60 kDa. The 34 kDa protein formed a long streak, suggesting a range of isoelectric points. This and its molecular weight suggest that it is not Go&#x003b1;. The 60 kDa protein has a pI more acidic than GAP-43 but less acidic than calmodulin.</p><p>What is the biological significance of GAP-43 binding to calmodulin in these cells? If the function of GAP-43 is to bind and sequester PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, as proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijms-9-1753">26</xref>], it is not clear why some of the GAP-43 is bound to calmodulin. It is clear that in a growing neuron, all regions of the plasma membrane are not equivalent, with protein kinase C phosphorylating GAP-43 in some regions and not others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ijms-9-1753">43</xref>]. Similarly, GAP-43 could be bound to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in some regions and to calmodulin in other regions of the plasma membrane. In cultured hippocampal neurons that were not treated with any agent to activate protein kinase C, approximately 50% of the total GAP-43 could be crosslinked by DSP to calmodulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijms-9-1753">25</xref>]. These cells are producing growth cones in the absence of these agents, so the release of GAP-43 from calmodulin that was observed when these agents were added suggests that protein kinase C has general access to most of the GAP-43 in the growing neuron but it is not activated in all regions. The purpose of the GAP-43/calmodulin interaction may still be as proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijms-9-1753">23</xref>], in that GAP-43 sequesters calmodulin in certain regions and releases it following GAP-43 phosphorylation by protein kinase C.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>3. Conclusions</title><p>The lack of quantitative recovery of GAP-43 by immunoprecipitation following DSP treatment of cells leaves open the possibility that GAP-43 becomes crosslinked to other proteins in the cell. The results tend to rule out GAP-43/actin interactions in these cells. It is clear from the present study that extensive crosslinking of GAP-43 to cytoskeletal and membrane skeletal proteins does not occur in living N1E-115 cells, suggesting that GAP-43 function in these cells may derive in part from its interaction with the lipid bilayer.</p></sec><sec><title>4.
