It has been suggested that disease symptoms are associated with clogging of xylem vessels. The aim of our study was to investigate extracellular defence reactions induced by <italic>V. longisporum </italic>in the xylem sap and leaf apoplast of <italic>Brassica napus </italic>var. <italic>napus </italic>in relation to the development of disease symptoms, photosynthesis and nutrient status.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><italic>V. longisporum </italic>(strain VL43) did not overcome the hypocotyl barrier until 3 weeks after infection although the plants showed massive stunting of the stem and mild leaf chlorosis. During this initial infection phase photosynthetic carbon assimilation, transpiration rate and nutrient elements in leaves were not affected in VL43-infected compared to non-infected plants. Proteome analysis of the leaf apoplast revealed 170 spots after 2-D-protein separation, of which 12 were significantly enhanced in response to VL43-infection. LS-MS/MS analysis and data base searches revealed matches of VL43-responsive proteins to an endochitinase, a peroxidase, a PR-4 protein and a &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase. In xylem sap three up-regulated proteins were found of which two were identified as PR-4 and &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase. Xylem sap of infected plants inhibited the growth of <italic>V. longisporum</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>V. longisporum </italic>infection did not result in drought stress or nutrient limitations. Stunting and mild chlorosis were, therefore, not consequences of insufficient water and nutrient supply due to VL43-caused xylem obstruction. A distinct array of extracellular PR-proteins was activated that might have limited <italic>Verticillium </italic>spreading above the hypocotyl. In silico analysis suggested that ethylene was involved in up-regulating VL43-responsive proteins.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p><italic>Verticillium longisporum </italic>colonizes the xylem of <italic>Brassicacae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] using carbohydrates, amino acids, and minerals present in the xylem sap as nutrient source. Xylem sap of oilseed rape also contains a vast spectrum of proteins including many enzymes putatively involved in defence; e.g. a disease resistance response protein (PR-1), chitinases (class I, IV), germin-like proteins (subfamily 1) and different peroxidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A comparison of various species suggested that xylem sap composition was conserved across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Despite the presence of constitutive defence systems in the extracellular compartment, xylem-invading and inhabiting fungi provoke additional reactions. For example, analyses of tomato xylem sap after infection with the xylem-colonising fungus <italic>Fusarium oxysporum </italic>revealed novel proteins including PR-1, PR-2, and PR-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In rice, infection with the vascular pathogen <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae </italic>induced the accumulation of a basic peroxidase in the apoplast of mesophyll cells as well as in xylem vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Vascular pathogens such as <italic>Cladosporium fulvum </italic>and <italic>Septoria tritici </italic>affected the leaf apoplast by increasing chitinases and 1,3-&#x003b2;-glucanases or a germin-like protein with activity of a protease-inhibitor, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the example of <italic>Cladosporium fulvum</italic>, which inactivates chitinases by Avr4 and thereby, protects its cell walls from degradation shows that vascular fungi have developed specific means to disarm plant defences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Recently, proteomic approaches have been introduced to obtain a comprehensive overview of proteins responsive in plants to pathogen attack. The apoplast, which includes the xylem sap, has received specific attention because it is the first compartment where recognition and defence may take place. When plants or cell cultures were challenged with pathogens or elicitors pronounced changes in the extracellular proteome were found such as accumulation of novel protease inhibitors, stimulation of defence proteins, modification in cell proteins, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. <italic>V. longisporum </italic>is one of the most important diseases of oilseed rape (<italic>Brassica napus </italic>var. <italic>oleifera</italic>) locally causing yield losses in the range of 10 to 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Activation of apoplastic defences has not been characterized in this species, although knowledge on these interactions may help to device strategies for improving plant resistance.</p><p><italic>Verticillium-</italic>infections have frequently been described as wilting disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. For example, <italic>V. dahliae </italic>infection resulted in partial vessel occlusion by deposits secreted by neighbouring parenchyma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These obstructions may delay movement of the fungus physically and also because they may contain antifungal components, e.g., elemental sulphur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Since these obstructions can be expected to affect water and nutrient transport, typical disease symptoms such as wilting, stunting, chlorosis and premature senescence, have been suggested to occur as consequences of water limitations and insufficient nutrient supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, clear-cut evidence for this sequence of disease symptoms is still lacking for the <italic>B. napus </italic>&#x02013; <italic>V. longisporum </italic>pathosystem. Since nutrient limitations and water stress can also affect the plant defence system, it is necessary to characterize the physiological stage of infected and non-infected to plants to distinguish between responses evoked by changes in the plant conditions and those related to fungal infection.</p><p>The major aim of our study was to identify proteins activated in response to <italic>V. longisporum </italic>in the leaf apoplast and xylem sap of <italic>Brassica napus </italic>and to investigate whether changes in the composition of extracellular fluid were efficient in attenuating fungal proliferation. We have characterized these responses in relation to the development of disease symptoms, photosynthetic electron transport, gas exchange and nutrient status.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>Verticillium</italic>-induced stunting is not caused by decline in photosynthetic gas exchange or plant nutrition</title><p>Stunting of the stem became apparent about 14 days after inoculation of oilseed rape plants with VL43 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Silver stained gels showed 170 &#x000b1; 9 protein spots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). We analysed 31 major spots common to both VL43-infected and non-infected plants to check if the apoplastic washing fluid was enriched in typical secretory proteins. Only 19 of these spots yielded peptides. The predicted sequences corresponded mainly to extracellular enzymes involved in defence and cell wall metabolism (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Several spots that were represented by just one peptide could not be identified unambiguously here (spot 10,17, 18 = predicted aspartyl protease, spot 11 = predicted peroxidase, spot 12&#x02013;15 = predicted glucanase) but pointed also the presence of typical extracellular enzymes, which have already previously been identified in oilseed rape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. With the exception of one protein with unknown function (spot 9) and two spots for a putative &#x003b1;-L-arabinofuranosidase (spots 5 and 7), all identified proteins contained a predicted target peptide for the secretory pathway. Whether the two putative &#x003b1;-L-arabinofuranosidase proteins were in fact mitochondrial proteins as suggested by TargetP analysis, is unlikely because the reliability of the prediction was low (RC4) and the <italic>Raphanus sativus </italic>enzyme, with which the highest homology existed, was shown to be localized in the cell wall fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Of the 12 spots, 6 could be identified by LC-MS/MS (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>) and corresponded to three different proteins, i.e., a basic &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase (3 spots), a basic endochitinase CHB4 (2 spots) and a peroxidase. The factor by which the intensities increased ranged from 2.4 to 8.3 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).

Our study clearly shows that neither these growth reductions nor beginning symptoms of chlorosis were the result of nutrient limitations or suppression of carbon assimilation. We have also no evidence that <italic>V. longisporum </italic>caused drought stress since the transpiration rate was unaffected in infected plants. This is in contrast to <italic>V. dahliae </italic>infections, which resulted in reduced stomatal opening in species like tomato, potato and egg plants and caused wilting symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Eynck et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] observed that clogging of vessels after VL43 infection of oilseed rape occurred infrequently and only at late stages of infection. They assumed, therefore, that these rare obstructions would not affect gross water transport. Our data corroborate this idea.</p><p>Although the effect on carbon assimilation was either marginal or not present, both <italic>Verticillium </italic>pathogens caused chlorosis [this study, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]]. Since chlorosis preceded fungal proliferation in leaves, it might have been caused by <italic>Verticillium </italic>toxins as suggested earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, chlorophyll loss is also a common symptom of nutrient deficiencies. Our study excludes the latter reason for <italic>V. longisporum </italic>infected oilseed rape. VL43 had also no effect on nutrient concentrations in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>leaves at early stages of stunting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

Therefore, we conclude that chlorosis is not the consequence of insufficient nutrient supply to leaves. Notably, in our study the amounts of nutrient elements nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur were higher in older leaves of VL43-infected oilseed rape than in those of non-infected controls. Increased phosphorus or nitrogen concentrations have also been reported in <italic>V. dahliae </italic>infected tomato, eggplant and in VL43-infected <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] suggesting a yet unknown interference of <italic>Verticillium </italic>with P or N metabolism.</p><p>Vital functions related to nutrition, water supply and photosynthetic carbon assimilation were not compromised &#x02013; at least not during infection stages when <italic>Verticillium </italic>was still retained in the root system.

We detected 170 protein spots in the apoplastic proteome of rape leaves. Since the focus of our work was on <italic>V. longisporum</italic>-responsive proteins, we analyzed only some of the unregulated proteins to document that apoplastic washing fluids were enriched in proteins with a signal peptide for the secretion pathway (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Among the identified proteins we confirmed the presence of chitinases, peroxidases, proteases, glucanases, germins, and some proteins involved in cell wall modifications in the leaf apoplast of healthy oilseed rape. A similar composition has also been reported for the apoplast and some cell wall-associated proteins of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

Among them were &#x003b1;-arabinofuranosidases that are members of a set of glycosidases required for degradation of polymeric substrates such as arabinan, arabinoxylan, and other polysaccharides, which are major components of plant cell wall hemicelluloses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These enzymes provide many microorganisms with soluble carbohydrates that can be used as carbon or energy sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Our study shows that these enzymes are part of the healthy apoplast and do not belong to the suite of primary responses to <italic>V. longisporum </italic>infection.</p><p>Our proteomic analysis revealed that only 7% apoplastic proteins were differentially regulated in response to VL43 suggesting that <italic>Verticillium </italic>evoked very distinct responses. All identified VL43-induced apoplastic proteins (&#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase, peroxidase, PR4-protein and endochitinase) are candidates already known to be involved in pathogen defence. For example, &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanases belong to the PR-2 protein family and hydrolyse &#x003b2;-1,3-glucans, major structural compounds of fungal cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Rep et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] have also found a basic and an acidic glucanase in the xylem sap of tomato after infection with the vascular fungus <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. Infections with <italic>V. dahliae </italic>caused increased expression and activities of glucanases and chitinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The PR4 protein identified here was homolog to that of a <italic>Pseudomonas syringae </italic>inducible PR4 protein of <italic>Brassica rapa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, expression of an ethylene-dependent PR4 protein was also increased after <italic>V. longisporum </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Since <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>mutants deficient in ethylene signalling (<italic>ein</italic>2, <italic>ein</italic>4, <italic>ein</italic>6) were more susceptible to <italic>V. longisporum</italic>, ethylene-associated signalling pathway appear to be involved in mediating <italic>Verticillium </italic>resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Indeed, Genevestigator analysis showed that the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>homologues of the endochitinase (At2g43590) and &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase (Atg57240) identified in our study were significantly increased after ethylene exposure. In other plant species, chitinases and glucanases were also induced by ethylene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In summary, this suggests that ethylene plays a yet unresolved role in <italic>V. longisporum </italic>responses of oilseed rape.</p><p>Overall, current studies suggest that the PR-response to <italic>V. longisporum </italic>is relatively conserved across different <italic>Brassicaceae </italic>[this study, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]]. Some of these proteins (PR4, &#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase) appeared in xylem sap even before fungal infection had overcome the hypocotyl barrier. Moreover, fungal growth in xylem sap of infected plants was massively inhibited (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that xylem sap proteins may play a crucial role in the control of <italic>V. longisporum</italic>. Since xylem elements consist of dead tissue, the sap proteins must either have been produced in roots or in parenchyma cells in the xylem such as ray cells. Further studies must show whether the biosynthesis of these proteins is stimulated in roots, how they are loaded into the xylem and whether they serve to retain the fungus underground.</p><p>Since the VL43-responsive proteins of xylem sap were also increased in the leaf apoplast, it is possible that they were transported with the ascent of sap into the leaf mesophyll, where they might have accumulated. However, the leaf apoplast of infected plants contained additional novel proteins (a peroxidase, an endochitinase and unidentified proteins) compared with the xylem sap. We suspect that the endochitinase found in leaf apoplast also originated from xylem sap because a protein with identical molecular weight was present in the latter. The increases in additional novel defence proteins in the leaf apoplast occurred before significant fungal proliferation in above-ground plant parts was apparent. This suggests that systemic signalling took place. It is currently unknown whether <italic>V. longisporum </italic>produced such signalling compounds, which might have been transported with the xylem sap. We can not exclude that the new xylem sap proteins themselves might have exerted signalling functions or that glucanase activities released elicitors from fungal cell walls which might have stimulated defence reactions in the leaf. This will require further analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion our data show that <italic>V. longisporum</italic>-induced stunting of oilseed rape was not caused by nutrient limitations, reduced water supply or suppression of photosynthesis. Although <italic>V. longisporum </italic>had not yet overcome the hypocotyl barrier, proteomic analysis of the leaf apoplast revealed activation of pathogen defence enzymes (&#x003b2;-1,3-glucanase, peroxidase, PR4, and endochitinase). This suggests systemic signalling of <italic>V. longisporum </italic>infection. A subset of the defence enzymes identified in leaf apoplast was also increased in xylem sap. Since orthologs of these enzymes in other plant species were regulated by ethylene, this phytohormone appears also to be involved in mediating <italic>V. longisporum </italic>responses in oilseed rape. The xylem sap of infected plants suppressed fungal proliferation compared with that of non infected plants suggesting that the activation of apoplastic defences contributes to limit fungal spreading.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant growth conditions and infection with <italic>Verticillium longisporum</italic></title><p><italic>Brassica napus </italic>var. <italic>napus </italic>(rapid-cycling rape provided by PH Williams, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Crucifer Genetics Cooperative) seeds were surface-sterilized for 15 min in a solution of 5% Ca hypochloride and 0.02% Triton X-100, washed in sterilized water, sown on root-medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], stored for 3 days at 4&#x000b0;C and then transferred to 20&#x000b0;C, 60% relative humidity, and a light intensity of 200 &#x003bc;mol m<sup>-2 </sup>s<sup>-1</sup>photosynthetically active radiation with an 16 h light/8 h dark cycle.
