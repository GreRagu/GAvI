We previously established that cell surface interaction between urokinase receptor (uPAR) and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-integrin initiates a sequel of events, involving MAPK-ERK activation that culminates in progressive cancer growth. We also identified the site on uPAR that binds &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-integrin. Disruption of uPAR/integrin interaction blocks ERK activation and forces cancer cells into dormancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Principle Findings</title><p>Using a target structure guided computation docking we identified 68 compounds from a diversity library of 13,000 small molecules that were predicted to interact with a previously identified integrin-binding site on uPAR. Of these 68 chemical hits, ten inhibited ERK activation in a cellular assay and of those, 2 compounds, <italic>2-(Pyridin-2-ylamino)-quinolin-8-ol and</italic>, <italic>2,2&#x02032;-(methylimino)di (8-quinolinol)</italic> inhibited ERK activation by disrupting the uPAR/integrins interaction.

Because this interaction occurs in cells with high uPAR expression, a property almost exclusive to cancer cells, we expect a new therapy based on these lead compounds to be cancer cell specific and minimally toxic. This treatment, rather than killing disseminated metastatic cells, should induce a protracted state of dormancy and prevent overt metastases.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is long standing clinical evidence, some inferential, but recently at the molecular level, that disseminated cancer cells can persist in a patient in a dormant state with no symptoms before they become actively growing to form overt metastases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Wikman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the mechanisms responsible for the conversion from dormant to active state remain largely unknown. Our long term goal is to identify molecular events that control cancer dormancy and to find ways to mimic them with aim of inducing and maintaining dormancy.</p><p>Previously, using a model of head and neck cancer, we determined that a high ratio of MAPK-ERK to SAPK-p38 activity was necessary for these cells to form a progressively growing tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-AguirreGhiso1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. This ratio was subsequently found to be predictive of the ability to form tumors by cells from multiple cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Wikman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In the head and neck model this ratio was achieved through the interaction of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-integrin with urokinase receptor (uPAR) which is highly expressed on these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-AguirreGhiso2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. We showed that this interaction activated the integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-AguirreGhiso1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and that through an &#x0201c;outside in&#x0201d; activation process, EGFR was recruited to the complex and activated signaling to ERK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Liu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. We also showed that antibody directed to Domain III region of uPAR, a protein made of 3 folded domains, but not other anti-uPAR antibodies, disrupted the uPAR/integrin interaction.</p><p>Before initiating a search for small molecules capable of disrupting uPAR/integrins association, we first identified the site on uPAR to which the integrin bound; this site is located at residues 240&#x02013;248 of Domain III of uPAR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Chaurasia1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The solved crystal structure shows that the 3 folded domains of uPAR form a urokinase binding pocket in the front of the molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Llinas1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> while residues 240&#x02013;248 are located in the back of the structure. Treatment of tumorigenic cells that possess a functional uPAR-integrins complex with a peptide derived from uPAR residues 240&#x02013;248 disrupted the complex, inactivated the &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-integrin, and reduced signal to ERK, while the same peptide with S245A substitution was inactive. The fact that a single amino acid was responsible for the functionality of the complex increased the possibility that a small molecule will be able to disrupt the interaction.</p><p>Although, an antibody and a peptide are able to disrupt the interaction, we believe that a small molecule with the same activity would be preferable. Since disruption of uPAR/integrin interaction shifts cells into proliferative arrest, without causing their death, to be an effective treatment the drug would have to be used chronically in patients suspected to have overt disseminated or residual disease. For that reason it would have to have limited toxicity and, 0preferably, be orally available. Because the library was selected on the basis of Lipinski's rule of 5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Lipinski1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, and because of the target which is an interaction that takes place when uPAR is over-expressed, a condition mostly of malignant tumors, those two requirement should be satisfied.</p><p>Our experimental model assigns an important role to a highly expressed uPAR in regulating cancer dormancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-AguirreGhiso1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-AguirreGhiso2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-AguirreGhiso3">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

This was based on our previous work that delineated a positive loop leading from uPAR/integrin interaction through ERK activation to transcriptional up-regulation of uPAR and determined that interruption of this loop forces cancer cells into dormancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-AguirreGhiso1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Chaurasia1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-AguirreGhiso3">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. We now identified two small molecules with uPAR/integrin disrupting activity that reduce ERK activation and, when applied to cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, inhibit growth.</p><p>Why is this approach preferable to direct blocking of ERK activity by MEK inhibitors, or to blocking of integrin activation by antagonists? The first and most important advantage is the relative specificity of the target; an interaction that takes place in high uPAR-expressing cells, such as cancer cells. The intended use of these compounds is to prevent occurrence of overt metastases in patients that harbor clinically undetectable residual disease. Since the drug is expected to induce and maintain dormancy, rather than cause acute cancer cell death, a successful outcome implies prolonged treatments and thus the need for oral availability and high index of specificity for cancer cells. We pose that inhibiting ERK by disrupting uPAR/integrin interaction should be less toxic than direct blocking of ERK activity through MEK inhibitors or inactivation of integrins, both of which would have more broader targets.</p><p>We and others have repeatedly shown that uPAR directly interacts with integrins affecting their activation state and changing intracellular signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-AguirreGhiso2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Tang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Wei1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Blasi1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. This has been shown by FRET, co-immunoprecipitation (IP) and genetic modifications of uPAR or the integrin. Only in specific instances involving vitronectin as matrix, the role of uPAR on integrin function was shown to be indirect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Madsen1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Since uPAR does not directly bind to FN, the preponderance of published data, including our own, allows the conclusion that MS#479 disrupts the existing interface between uPAR and the integrin and stops the signaling cascade. This has been confirmed by multiple approaches, including FN-fibril disruption, reduced adhesion to FN, and loss of &#x0201c;activation&#x0201d; epitopes on integrins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004617-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), which all point to &#x0201c;de-activation&#x0201d; of the integrin. Cells that express &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-integrin but not uPAR, such as melanoma, were insensitive to the effect of MS#479. We did not examine the effect of the two lead compounds on disruption of other uPAR/integrin pairs. However, our previous work has shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Chaurasia1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> that &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1-integrin binds much less efficiently to the identified 240&#x02013;248 amino acid residue sequence. Because other uPAR/integrin complexes might also be important in generating proliferative signals in cancer cells, it might be necessary to find specific molecules that will disrupt these interactions.</p><p>Is it feasible that a 3-domain folded uPAR protein can physically contact &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-integrin through a sequence in domain III, which most likely is membrane proximal? In spite of extensive effort by several outstanding laboratories, some controversies regarding integrin conformation capable of ligand binding and the mechanism of their activation still persist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Mould1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Although, it is believed that integrin is in extended form when binding ligands, there is also evidence based on electron microscope analysis indicating that the extodomain of integrin bound to a fragment of fibronectin (F7&#x02013;F10) appears to be in a similar compact (bent) conformation as the unbound extodomain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Adair1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that ligands such as uPAR, smaller than the full length large matrix proteins, can bind to the bent conformation. Whether this is sufficient to fully activate integrin or whether additional interactions need to take place, remains to be determined.</p><p>In our search for active compounds we combined biological and biochemical approaches to identify the site of interaction between the two receptors. We found the sequence 240&#x02013;248, (GCATASMCQ) to be the site of interaction, with serine 245 being a crucial residue. This information facilitated the <italic>in silico</italic> screening of a library of compounds in that the computational evaluation of chemical compound binding to the target protein could be analyzed in greater detail. To the best of our knowledge the disruption by a small molecule of extracellular domains of two cell surface receptors and its consequence on intracellular signaling and biological outcomes has not been described, adding to the novelty of our approach. It was previously thought that due to the large surfaces area involved in protein/protein interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-LoConte1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, small molecules would not be optimal candidates for disruption of these interactions. However, more recently, it was concluded that a much smaller subset of the interface (&#x0201c;hot-spots&#x0201d;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004617-Arkin1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> for review, might be responsible for the high affinity protein/protein interaction. It appears that in the case of uPAR/integrin interaction, serine 245 of a small &#x003b1;-helix is located in a surface exposed cavity that provides a crucial site for molecular interaction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004617-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Polar atoms of the protein located within 3&#x000c5; of MS#479, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004617-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) suggest possible derivatives for improvement of its affinity. Since the lead compounds were identified from a diversity library of compounds selected on the basis of the Lipinski rule for drug-like properties, we expect that it will be possible to further optimize our lead compounds by chemical modifications.</p><p>In summary, we have found a potential cancer specific target, uPAR/integrin interaction site, and used it to identify a small molecule that, by disrupting this interaction, might be able to force cancer cells into dormancy. This might provide opportunity to convert residual disease in cancer patients into a chronic but asymptomatic state.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>An ethics statement is not required for this work. <italic>Reagents and Antibodies</italic>- BSA and human FN were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

Tumors were weighed, and either minced and lysed for Luciferase activity measurements or, when generated by T-HEp3-ELK-GFP- cells, dissociated into single cell suspensions and total tumor cells and GFP-expressing cells were counted using Nikon TS100 fluorescent microscope.
