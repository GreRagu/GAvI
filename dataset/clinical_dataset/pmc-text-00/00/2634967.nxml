We hypothesized that anti-retroviral suppression of T cell activation levels would lead to alterations in the T cell differentiation of total and HIV-1 specific CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses among recently HIV-1 infected adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We performed a longitudinal study simultaneously measuring T cell activation and maturation markers on both total and antigen-specific T cells in recently infected adults: prior to treatment; after the initiation of HAART; and after treatment was halted. Prior to treatment, HIV-1 Gag&#x02013;specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells were predominantly of a highly activated, intermediate memory (CD27&#x0002b;CD28&#x02212;) phenotype, while CMV pp65-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells showed a late memory (CD27&#x02212;CD28&#x02212;), low activation phenotype. Participants with the highest fraction of late memory (CD27&#x02212;CD28&#x02212;) HIV-1-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells had higher CD4&#x0002b; T cell counts (rho&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x0002b;0.74, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.004). In turn, those with the highest fraction of intermediate memory (CD27&#x0002b; CD28&#x02212;) HIV-1 specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells had high total CD8&#x0002b; T cell activation (rho&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x0002b;0.68, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.01), indicating poorer long-term clinical outcomes.

Anti-retroviral treatment initiated two to four months after infection lowered T cell activation but had no effect on the differentiation profile of the HIV-1-specific response.

Furthermore, elevated CD8&#x0002b; T cell activation, and not viral load, distinguish pathogenic from non-pathogenic lentiviral infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Kaur1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Choudhary1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations have lead to a general consensus that CD8&#x0002b; T cell activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of immunodeficiency. Yet the mechanism whereby elevated CD8&#x0002b; T cell activation leads to immunodeficiency during untreated HIV-1 disease remains unclear. The T cell response to HIV-1 is marked by a second distinguishing feature. Several groups have observed that HIV-1 specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells fail to differentiate to a fully mature effector cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-vanBaarle1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-vanBaarle2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. We hypothesized that a block in T cell maturation may be related to elevated activation on HIV-1 specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells, and be relieved by suppression of T cell activation levels by anti-retroviral treatment (ART).</p><p>On encountering antigen CD8&#x0002b; T cells differentiate from the least differentiated (na&#x000ef;ve or early memory) stage to the most mature (memory/effector) stage. In this process, cell surface receptors are progressively down-regulated (CD45RA CCR7, CD28, CD27, CD127) as CD8&#x0002b; T cells differentiate and up-regulated or re-expressed (CD57, CD45RA). While there is broad general agreement on how to define a na&#x000ef;ve T cell, there is not yet a unified model that describes the process of human T cell differentiation (reviewed by Appay et al 2008 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Appay1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>) but memory cells can be divided into Early (EM), Intermediate (IM) and Late (LM) stages using CD27 and CD28. T cell differentiation profiles have been found to differ across antigen specificities, and may relate to the effectiveness of long-term control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Northfield1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Addo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The CMV-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cell response displays a predominantly late memory phenotype. As CMV infection is typically well controlled in adults, this suggests a more differentiated phenotype may be beneficial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Appay2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The reverse is true for HIV-1-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells, which are enriched for a more intermediate memory phenotype. Likewise, in chronic, virulent HCV infection there is an expansion of the intermediate memory and a lack of late memory, HCV specific CD8&#x0002b; cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Lucas1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Among EBV/HIV-1 co-infected persons, the absence of differentiated EBV specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells has been associated with EBV-associated non-Hodgkins lymphoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-vanBaarle2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>As yet there has been limited work measuring the simultaneous expression of activation and differentiation markers on HIV-specific T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Chun1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Papagno1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we used polychromatic flow cytometry to examine the co-expression of CD38, CD27 and CD28 on total T cells and antigen-specific (HIV, CMV) T cells in a cohort of adults in early HIV-1 infection (within 6 months of acquisition). This approach allowed us to examine the relationship between T cell activation and differentiation, relate these profiles to HIV clinical markers among recently HIV-1 infected adults, and determine if effective anti-retroviral therapy can durably alter these profiles. We observed that HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells were predominantly of an IM phenotype and were significantly more activated than LM Gag-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells. Individuals with the highest CD8&#x0002b; T cell activation levels also had the greatest proportion of IM Gag-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells while those with the highest proportion of more differentiated LM Gag-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells had the highest CD4&#x0002b; T cell counts. Together these data suggest that the presence of mature Gag-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells with low levels of activation may be protective during early infection. Our analysis may serve as a resource to researchers who seek to understand the relationship of key T cell markers to one another, as part of an effort to describe an effective T cell response to HIV-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Demographic, laboratory and clinical markers at all three study time-points (pre-therapy baseline visit 1, on anti-retroviral therapy visit 2, and post-anti-retroviral therapy visit 3) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004408-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0004408-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004408.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Demographic, Clinical and Laboratory Measures By Study Time-point</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0004408-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0004408.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0004408-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study Entry</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">On Treatment<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">&#x0002a;</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post-Treatment</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Measurement</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Median (IQR)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">&#x0002a;&#x0002a;</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">&#x0002a;&#x0002a;</xref></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CD4&#x0002b;T cell count (cells/&#x000b5;L)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">522 (490, 671)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">899 (612, 1170)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.004</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">715 (579, 1181)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.04</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Viral Load (log<sub>10</sub> c/mL)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.95 (4.1, 5.7)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.31 (2.31, 2.31)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.004</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.05 (2.87, 4.89)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.05</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CD8&#x0002b;

Our data suggests that there may be a link between the activation and maturation stage of CD8&#x0002b; T cells. The skewed, less differentiated maturation profile of HIV-1-specific T cells was more pronounced at higher CD8&#x0002b; T cell activation levels. We also found that increased numbers of fully differentiated HIV-1-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells associated with higher CD4&#x0002b; T cell counts suggesting that the presence of mature Gag-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells may be protective. However the HIV-1 Gag-specific T cell differentiation profile was not readily altered by suppression of T cell activation by anti-retroviral treatment.</p><p>We compared CMV- and HIV-1-specific responses in early infection.

The level of activation on all subsets of pp65-specific cells was much lower than on Gag-specific cells. These data suggest that a low activation state, a high magnitude of CMV specific IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-2 responses, and a high proportion of mature CMV specific CD8&#x0002b; T effector cells may be important features in the control of CMV.</p><p>It has been suggested that distinct T cell maturation profiles, associated with responses to different viruses, are established for the purpose of generating memory or maintaining latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Appay1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. A recent report suggested that protective Class I B&#x0002a;27 HIV-1 KK10-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells have a intermediate differentiation phenotype (CD27&#x0002b;CD28&#x02212;CD45RA-CCR7-) that was indistinguishable from CD8&#x0002b; T cells specific for other less-protective HIV-1 epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Almeida1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. This may indicate that an intermediate differentiation phenotype can be associated with protection. That said, in agreement with our finding that a more differentiated HIV-1 specific CD8&#x0002b; T cell response is associated with higher CD4 counts two recent clinical studies have suggested that more differentiated CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses are associated with lower HIV-1 viral load set point, or long-term non-progressor status in HIV-1 disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Northfield1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Addo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Lower CD8&#x0002b; T cell activation may mark or induce a state of less differentiated total and CD4&#x0002b; T cell responses. This in turn may amount to a lower fraction of IM CD4&#x0002b; T cells expressing CCR5 and lower cell turn-over, rendering the CD4&#x0002b; T cell population less susceptible to infection. The reverse state - of higher CD8&#x0002b; T cell activation - may associate with increased CD4&#x0002b; T cell loss due to cytokine forced expansion of EM CD4&#x0002b; T cells into an IM pool. This stimulation, in the absence of cognate antigen could lead to apoptosis, or direct viral infection and cell death.</p><p>We found that patients with the highest numbers of EM Gag-Specific CD4&#x0002b; T cells had the lowest levels of T cell activation, suggesting that &#x02013; in contrast to our findings on CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses &#x02013; that a less differentiated CD4&#x0002b; T cell response may be associated with better clinical status. Our data is consistent with a report suggesting a less differentiated CD4&#x0002b; T cell response marks long-term non-progression in HIV disease, a state of low CD8&#x0002b; T cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Emu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Repeated stimulation of Gag-specific T cells, by persistent HIV-1 replication, may induce high levels of activation and block maturation into a mature effector phenotype. Based on our model linking activation to maturation impairment, we reasoned that in the absence of repeated antigen stimulation the proportion of Gag-specific T cells with a low activation, LM phenotype may increase. We therefore examined maturation and activation following anti-retroviral therapy and reduction of circulating virus to undetectable levels. While a significant decline in activation levels on all CD8&#x0002b; T cell subsets was apparent, reduced antigen load had different effects on total, CMV- and HIV-1-specific T cell differentiation profiles. Following therapy, the CMV-specific CD4&#x0002b; IM T cell pool did expand as the LM pool shrunk. This suggests that HIV-1 viremia, or generalized immune activation may influence the differentiation profile of CMV specific CD4&#x0002b; T cell responses. Among total CD8&#x0002b; T cells there was a significant reduction in the IM and a corresponding increase in the LM fraction. As activation declines the total IM CD8&#x0002b; T cell fraction may mature, or die by apoptosis, shifting the population to an LM profile. In contrast, despite a significant reduction of activation levels on Gag-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells, there was no corresponding shift in the maturation profile of Gag specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells. Taken together, these data suggest that high activation and viral load does not prevent the maturation of Gag-specific cells, although these effects may be apparent on T cells of other specificities. The Gag-specific T cells that we measured may have already become replicatively senescent due to repeated stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Papagno1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The mechanism by which maturation and activation are associated prior to treatment is not clear from our results. The relative paucity of LM HIV-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells may be due to increased susceptibility of these to apoptosis, even after ART suppression of activation. That said, the failure of CD8&#x0002b; T cells to mature may result from manipulation of signaling pathways in responding HIV-1 specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells by a viral product, such as secreted Nef, which has been shown to upregulate PD-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Muthumani1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Earlier intervention with anti-retroviral therapy may lower T cell activation during very early infection, alter the T cell differentiation phenotype of responding CD8&#x0002b; T cells, or both, in a manner which confers enhanced T cell mediated control of HIV-1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Overview</title><p>Thirteen treatment na&#x000ef;ve adults in early HIV infection were studied for T cell responses and phenotypes at 1) study entry (within 2&#x02013;4 months of acquiring infection), 2) after having reached complete virologic suppression on a first anti-retroviral regimen (defined as 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and at least 1 protease inhibitor and/or 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) and 3) several months after having halted anti-retroviral therapy.</p><sec id="s4a1"><title>San Francisco Recent HIV-1 Infection Cohort</title><p>All specimens were drawn from persons enrolled in the Options study of early HIV-1 infection conducted in a university based research clinic.

Cryopreserved PBMCS were rapidly thawed in to warm RPMI 1640 with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (UCSF Cell Culture Facility) and counted using the Viacount assay on a Guava Personal Cell Analysis system (Guava Technologies). For Cytokine Flow Cytometry (CFC) assays PBMC were re-suspended at 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>&#x02013;2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in the same medium, and rested overnight in slanted 15-mL conical tubes with loosened caps, in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37&#x000b0;C.

After a 50 minute incubation in the dark at 4&#x000b0;C cells were exposed to a 40-W fluorescent light for 10 min at room temperature to cross-link the EMA. FMO (Fluorescent minus-one) controls were run with each experiment to ensure that breakdown of tandem conjugates (e.g. APC-CY7 to APC) was not occurring and to assist with setting gates.

Rainbow beads (Spherotec) were used to standardize instrument settings between runs. Between 900,000 and 1 million lymphocytes were collected for each sample. Data was compensated and analyzed by using Flowjo Software (Treestar Inc). The gating strategies used to define CD4&#x0002b; and CD8&#x0002b; T cell maturation and activation populations, to define antigen-specific T cells, and to subset these cells for activation and maturation markers are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004408-g001">figure 1</xref>. We defined a T cell response as the percent of cells expressing cytokine in response to HIV Gag or CMV pp65 after subtraction of background signal. The proportion of CD8&#x0002b; T cells responding to antigen stimulation varied from 0 to 7.5&#x00025; (median IFN&#x003b3;&#x0002b; response 0.46&#x00025; to Gag and 1.6&#x00025; to pp65) and in some cases insufficient cytokine positive events were obtained to determine the level of activation or maturation markers. CD4&#x0002b; T cells responses were low for some subjects (median IFN&#x003b3;&#x0002b; response 0.072&#x00025; to Gag and 0.15&#x00025; to pp65). We restricted the analysis of maturation markers to responses where greater than 100 IFN&#x003b3;&#x0002b; events were collected. As a result we do not present subset analyses of the IFN-g\IL-2 responding populations, nor do we present the expression of CD38 MFI on antigen-specific CD4&#x0002b; T cell responses as the IM and LM populations were scarce. The activation state of antigen specific cells was measured by examining the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD38 on each differentiation stage. In this analysis we measured CD38 MFI expression on the IFN-&#x003b3; expressing CD4&#x0002b; or CD8&#x0002b; T cell population. We assigned the CD8&#x0002b; T cell differentiation stages according to the scheme proposed by Appay as Early Memory (EM) for CD27&#x0002b;CD28&#x0002b;, Intermediate Memory (IM) for CD27&#x0002b;CD28- and Late Memory (LM) for CD27&#x02212;CD28&#x02212; CD8&#x0002b; T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Appay2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004408-Papagno2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.
