Initially defined by Townsend as a "state of observable and demonstrable disadvantage relative to the local community or the wider society to which an individual, family or group belongs"[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], deprivation has been quantified using a score obtained by summing standardized variables, each measuring different ecological dimensions derived from census data. Income data was not included in the calculation of the Townsend index, mainly because it was not possible to obtain those data in the United Kingdom when the index was designed. Nevertheless, the concept of deprivation was not defined as a proxy of income, but as an accumulation of disadvantages.</p><p>Other deprivation indices have been developed on that basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The most recent are generally calculated by factor analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and include income data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Thus, the weights allocated to each dimension aim to reflect optimally the variability of the socioeconomic dimensions considered within the population studied. This choice implicitly supposes that the probably high correlation between the various components prevents determining which components are the most relevant and their weightings.</p><p>One criticism of the most classic indices used, the Carstairs and Townsend indices, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] relates to their urban view of deprivation, explaining the weaker associations between those indices and the health indicators observed for rural areas, compared to those for urban areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. For instance, the meaning of the proportion of households without a car, which is a variable used to define those indices, differs depending on whether rural or urban areas are considered.</p><p>Health inequalities are a quite recent subject in France. Previous studies were essentially based, at an individual level, on specific surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and, at an ecological level, on specific regions of France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To the authors' knowledge, no spatially defined deprivation index has yet been proposed for analysis of health inequalities on a routine basis for all of France.</p><p>The association between socioeconomic level and mortality at individual or population level has been widely studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and a strong association between deprivation and mortality has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Some characteristics of the spatial association have yet to be specified.</p><p>First, it is important to evaluate the extent to which the choice of the spatial scale influences the association between deprivation and mortality. This has rarely been done [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Secondly, the rural-urban gradient is one of the major influential factors in spatial issues. Over the whole of France, the homogeneity of the association between deprivation and mortality with respect to the rural-urban gradient and various regions had not yet been studied.</p><p>Lastly, among the mechanisms explaining socioeconomic mortality differences, the risk behaviours targeted by primary prevention (smoking, alcohol, road traffic) have often been mentioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The association between deprivation and 'avoidable' mortality may be analysed by specifically considering the causes of death that are the most frequently linked with risk behaviours for subjects aged under 65 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study is to propose a deprivation index, based on the census and the tax authority's household income data, which may be used in both rural and urban contexts, and to evaluate the ecological association between that index and mortality. More specifically, the spatial determinants influencing the association have been addressed and the variations with age, gender and cause of death described, with a specific focus on the causes of 'avoidable' mortality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Spatial scale</title><p>Mainland France has a population of nearly 60 million. Five administrative or statistical spatial units, of different sizes, were considered: <italic>communes </italic>(the smallest administrative units in France, 30,500 units), <italic>cantons </italic>(3,700 units), <italic>zones d'emploi </italic>(350 units), <italic>d&#x000e9;partements </italic>(96 units) and <italic>r&#x000e9;gions </italic>(22 units). The main results were calculated on the <italic>commune </italic>scale, with a median population of 500 and a wide range of variation, from 80 to 400,000.</p></sec><sec><title>Urban unit category (UUC)</title><p>The urban unit concept developed by the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) was used to define the degree of urbanicity of the <italic>communes</italic>. An urban unit is a group of <italic>communes </italic>in which no residence is separated from the next by more than 200 metres. There are five urban unit categories (UUC) of <italic>commune</italic>: rural (less than 2,000 people), quasi-rural (population from 2,000 to 9,999), quasi-urban (population from 10,000 to 99,999), urban (population from 100,000 to 1,999,999) and Paris-and-suburbs (Paris Urban Unit).</p></sec><sec><title>Deprivation index</title><p>The deprivation index, 'FDep99', was constructed on the <italic>commune </italic>scale, using the socioeconomic data available on that scale: the 1999 population census (source: INSEE) and the tax authority's 2001 household income data (source: INSEE). As the latter data were only available for <italic>communes </italic>of more than 50 households, the analyses were limited to 30,500 of the 36,600 <italic>communes</italic>, representing 99.2% of the whole population. The index was constructed in order to ensure the following properties: one-dimensional; maximization of the heterogeneity of the components; and consistent association with the components.</p><p>Four variables derived from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], each representing a fundamental dimension of socioeconomic level, of homogeneous meaning over the whole country, and correlated with the other variables within and between the UUC, were selected: the median household income, the percentage high school graduates in the population aged 15 years and older, the percentage blue-collar workers in the active population, and the unemployment rate. The first two variables constitute negative dimensions of deprivation, and the last two constitute positive dimensions.</p><p>FDep99 was defined as the first component of a principal component analysis (PCA) of those four variables. FDep99 accounted for 68% of the total variation and was strongly correlated with each of the components in a manner consistent with deprivation (negatively with income and the percentage high school graduates, and positively with the percentage blue-collar workers and the unemployment rate). The PCA coefficients for the four variables were very similar when calculated separately for each UUC and for all of France.</p><p>Proxies of the Townsend and Carstairs indices were calculated in order to compare them with the present index. Originally, the Townsend index was generated from British data as the sum of the following standardized variables: percentage of unemployed people in the active population, percentage of not-owner-occupied households, percentage of households without a car and percentage of overcrowded households. The original Carstairs index was calculated, using the same method, but the percentage of not-owner-occupied households was replaced by the percentage low social class people. In this study, the mean number of occupants per room and the percentage of blue-collar workers in the active population were used instead of the percentage overcrowded households and percentage low social class people, respectively, as the latter data were not available on a small scale in France.</p><p>For the units larger than the <italic>commune</italic>, the FDep99 index was calculated as the population-weighted mean of the <italic>commune </italic>values. As that measurement is only optimal for a normal distribution of FDep99, the population weighted median FDep99, a non parametric indicator, was also calculated. The latter was correlated (Pearson &#x003c1; = 0.99) with the population weighted mean on each spatial scale. Thus, only the results with population weighted means are shown.</p></sec><sec><title>Mortality data</title><p>The mortality data were derived from the Inserm-C&#x000e9;piDc database for mainland France for the period 1997&#x02013;2001. Overall there were 2,650,390 deaths. The commune of residence, which is systematically included in the death record, was used as the spatial location.</p><p>The underlying causes of death were analysed and classified using the 17 categories aggregated by Eurostat. An additional category, 'avoidable' causes linked to risk behaviours targeted by primary prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], was defined for 'premature' deaths occurring before age 65 years only. This category consisted in causes of death related to smoking and alcohol consumption (lung, trachea and bronchus cancers (ICD10 Code: C32&#x02013;C34), aerodigestive tract cancers (C00&#x02013;C14), oesophagus cancer (C15), alcohol abuse (F10), chronic liver disease (K70, K73&#x02013;K74)), drug dependence (F11), AIDS (B20&#x02013;B24), transport accidents (V01&#x02013;V99), suicides (X60&#x02013;X84) and homicides (X85&#x02013;Y09).</p></sec><sec><title>Association measures</title><p>The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was used to characterize the mortality differentials for the period 1997&#x02013;2001. SMR was calculated as the ratio of the observed mortality in a spatial unit, over the corresponding expected mortality (national mortality rates for the period 1997&#x02013;2001 applied to the spatial unit population, by age and gender). The association between the deprivation index and SMR was assessed using two measures:</p><p>- the ratio (SMR<sub>Qi/</sub>SMR<sub>Q1</sub>) between the SMR of the spatial unit whose deprivation index was between the (i-1)<sup>th </sup>and the i<sup>th </sup>quintile (SMR<sub>Qi</sub>: the SMR of the i<sup>th </sup>deprivation quintile) and the SMR of the spatial unit whose deprivation index was below the first quintile (SMR<sub>Q1</sub>),</p><p>- the log-linear trend, defined as the linear association between the logarithm of the SMR and the deprivation index. Log-linear trend was considered rather than linear trend because of the multiplicative structure of the SMR. However, as every SMR considered in this article was close to 1, the SMR was close to log(SMR + 1). Therefore, the log-linear associations were considered approximately equal to the linear associations.</p><p>This measure quantified the average relative increase in mortality per unit of deprivation over the whole range of deprivation. As the observed association was quasi-linear, it was used to compare the amplitudes of the associations for different categories and to adjust mortality variations for deprivation. The association was calculated as "&#x003b2;", derived from the following Poisson model allowing for overdispersion:</p><p><disp-formula><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M1" name="1471-2458-9-33-i1" overflow="scroll"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>u</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>&#x0221d;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>P</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x003bb;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>u</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02061;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>&#x003bb;</mml:mi><mml:mtext>u</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02061;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mtext>E</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>u</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>&#x003b1;</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>&#x003b2;</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x022c5;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>FDep</mml:mtext><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mn>99</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>u</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>In which 'u' is a spatial unit, 'O<sub>u</sub>' is the number of deaths observed in 'u' for the 1997&#x02013;2001 period, 'E<sub>u</sub>' is the expected number of deaths in 'u', 'FDep99<sub>u</sub>' is the mean deprivation index in 'u', '&#x003b1;' is the intercept and '&#x003b2;' is the log-linear trend.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Variations in mortality and deprivation indices with urban unit category (UUC)</title><p>The mortality was significantly lower, by at least 9%, in the Paris-and-suburbs UUC than in the other UUC (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

In an ecological analysis, those two levels cannot be distinguished. However, some authors built their synthetic deprivation indices in order to approximate each subject's socioeconomic level, in particular by standardizing the components by age and gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The FDep99 index was not designed for that purpose and its components were therefore not age- or gender-standardized. Thus, the FDep99 index takes into account the potential influence of the population structure by age and gender on contextual socioeconomic level.</p><p>The construction of the FDep99 index is very similar to that of the most recent indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The FDep99 index is proposed in a pragmatic manner, based on the small-scale socioeconomic data available in France, and has been validated using non-exhaustive criteria. The constructed index cannot be used, as such, on other countries' data because it remains influenced by the choice of the variables available and their weightings, which were determined using French data. The proposed approach to index construction took account of the structural spatial socioeconomic specificities of a population, without any <italic>a priori </italic>link with general mortality.</p><p>When the whole of France was considered, the FDep99 index was not well correlated with the Townsend and Carstairs indices. More specifically, the FDep99 index was lower for urban categories than for rural categories, while the Townsend and Carstairs indices exhibited the opposite pattern. This difference is mainly due to the inclusion of variables related to car ownership and housing, whose practical meanings are dependant on the rural-urban gradient, in the definition of the Carstairs and Townsend indices. With the French data, those variables did not co-vary between-UUC according to the other deprivation components considered. Therefore, the variables were not included in the FDep99 index. Other studies have also shown that the Townsend and Carstairs indices are not necessarily consistent over a whole country, but rather over areas in which the degree of urbanicity is quite homogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. That limitation does not seem to apply to the FDep99 index.</p><p>The correlations with the Townsend and Carstairs indices were higher for within-UUC correlations.</p><p>The weak correlations may also be a result of the approximations of the Townsend and Carstairs indices due to the French census variables available.</p></sec><sec><title>Association between FDep99 index and mortality</title><p>The results showed the homogeneity of the association between the FDep99 index and all-cause mortality, with regard to the various degrees of urbanicity and the regions. This result, rarely observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], is consistent with the FDep99 index having a homogeneous meaning over the whole country.</p><p>In addition, the association between mortality and deprivation was observed on all the geographic scales and for most of the disease categories. Taking socioeconomic factors into account in ecological analyses thus appears necessary, irrespective of the scale considered. Moreover, deprivation is associated with health in general, despite the specifically stronger associations for certain diseases and the very diverse mechanisms involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>The weaker association for the elderly observed in this study has already been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This finding may be due to selection of the healthiest subjects in the lower social categories.</p><p>The association between deprivation and all-cause mortality for women and for children aged under 1 year was generally significantly positive, but the amplitude was smaller than for the other categories. The result, already reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], is likely to reflect the lower frequency of risk behaviours and occupational exposures in those population categories. With regards to female cancers, for which the association is almost nil, the generally non-positive association between socioeconomic level and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and the negative gradient between smoking and socioeconomic level in women aged over 45 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] are noteworthy.</p><p>In this study, the mortality indicators and deprivation indices were considered cross-sectionally and defined over closed time periods. One of the limitations of this approach derives from the possibility that the influence of deprivation on a population, possibly giving rise to a higher mortality rate, is also exerted over a period preceding death. This is obvious for long term exposure differentials or subjects that have moved. Nevertheless, in most cases, the deprivation of a spatial unit at a given time reflects a long time course and common socioeconomic characteristics shared by the subjects living in, or moving into, that unit. However, it may be important to analyse associations between deprivation and mortality by including time lags between the two phenomena.</p></sec><sec><title>Public health implications</title><p>As is the case in many other countries, the 'Profession and socioprofessional category' is the only individual variable characterising socioeconomic level in French death records. The category is only reliably reported for subjects aged between 25 and 55 years. Thus, another approach is needed for the analysis of socioeconomic mortality differentials, even if it is purely descriptive. The ecological approach, via the deprivation concept, has the advantage of being routinely feasible without incurring strong confidentiality constraints. In addition, deprivation reflects the socioeconomic disparities of the whole population, including subjects aged over 55 years.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The deprivation index reflects a major part of spatial socioeconomic heterogeneity, in a homogeneous manner, over the whole country.</p><p>The strong and regular association of the index with mortality suggests that an ecological deprivation index built using a simple method, like that proposed herein, or constructed following broader consultation of the various observers of social inequalities, such as the UK Indicator of Multiple Deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] (IMD), should be adopted by health authorities in order to observe, analyse and manage spatial health inequalities.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>GR and DH were the principal investigators of the study.
