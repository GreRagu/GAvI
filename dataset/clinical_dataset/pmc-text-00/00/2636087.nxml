However, a patent choroidal hole leadingto suprachoroidal collection of internal tamponading agentsis a unique event. Our search of literature using the Medlinedatabase failed to reveal a similar report. We report two suchcases.</p><sec sec-type=""><title>Case Reports</title><sec><title>Case 1</title><p>A 36-year-old male presented 20 days after scleral repair forruptured globe (left eye) following a traffic accident. Examinationat this stage revealed hyphema, aniridia, aphakia and vitreoushemorrhage. Ultrasonography revealed hemorrhagic choroidaldetachment and retinal detachment. He underwent parsplana vitrectomy and suprachoroidal blood drainage nextday. During surgery, the retina was found bunched up withsignificant membrane formation on both sides of the retina.After membrane peeling and 360-degree retinectomy, theretina could be attached using perfluorocarbon liquids (PFCL).Perfluorocarbon liquids-silicone oil exchange was done.Shallow choroidal detachment persisted in the periphery, whichwas attributed to residual choroidal hemorrhage.</p><p>On the first postoperative day, a large bubble of PFCL wasseen on the retinal surface. He was taken up for resurgery inseven days time and the bubble was removed while injectingadditional silicon oil. One day later, another large bubbleof PFCL was noted on the retinal surface. At this stage, thechoroidal hole was prominently made out with increased extentof choroidal detachment in that quadrant. It was realized thatsilicone oil and PFCL were trapped in the suprachoroidal space.He was again taken up for surgery two weeks later. Silicone oiland PFCL trapped in the suprachoroidal space were drainedexternally using a relatively posteriorly placed sclerotomy. Thevitreous cavity was reinjected with silicone oil. Eighteen monthspostoperatively the retina remained attached with recovery of20/400 vision. However, the choroidal hole remained patent[<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>]. The eye is still soft and hence silicone oil has not beenremoved.</p></sec><sec><title>Case 2</title><p>A seven-year-old girl presented with a four-day-old penetratinginjury (with needle) and endophthalmitis in her right eye. Sheunderwent emergency lensectomy and vitrectomy along withintravitreal injection of antibiotics. The infection was graduallycontrolled after repeated intravitreal injection of antibioticsbased on culture reports. She was seen to have developedrhegmatogenous retinal detachment 10 days after the injury.There was choroidal detachment and significant proliferativevitreoretinopathy. During resurgery, a 360-degree relaxingretinectomy had to be done in view of the incarceration of theretina in the wound. Perfluorocarbon liquid was used to settlethe retina and was replaced with 1000 centistokes silicone oil.Ten days postoperatively, a small bubble of PFCL was notedin the vitreous cavity. At this stage, her best-corrected visionwas 20/60. Shallow choroidal detachment was also noted with arelatively soft eye but with attached retina. Progressive recurrentfibrosis occurred in the periphery, exerting traction on the retinaas well as on the bare choroid/retinal pigment epithelium(RPE). Approximately six months after the first surgery, it wasdecided to reoperate, in view of the progressive drop in visiondue to recurrent fibrosis and tractional retinal detachment.The silicone oil was removed and membrane peeling wasdone and the fibrosed edge of the previous retinectomy wasexcised. Perfluorocarbon liquid was used to flatten the retina.It was then noted that PFCL was entering the suprachoroidalspace through a choroidal hole located in the area of barechoroid/RPE. Although external pressure at this site broughtthe PFCL into the vitreous cavity, the space could not be totallyevacuated. Similarly, silicone oil, which was exchanged withPFCL, also entered this space. Four months from this surgery,she maintained 20/100 best-corrected vision. The eye was softwith band keratopathy. The retina was attached. The choroidalhole remained open with a pocket of choroidal detachmentnoted near the hole [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>]. The silicone oil was seen fillingthe vitreous cavity and extending into the pocket of choroidaldetachment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Discussion</title><p>Choroidal involvement in cases of penetrating trauma to eyescan manifest as benign choroidal thickening, suprachoroidalhematoma, choroidal detachment, suprachoroidal hemorrhage,indirect and direct traumatic chorioretinal ruptures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Thesite of the choroidal injury invariably undergoes fibrosis andnever remains patent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Our two cases illustrate an interestingcomplication of severe trauma, wherein a patent choroidalhole was noted at some stage in the management of the case.In Case 1, the hole was small initially and went unrecognized.The migration of a large bubble of PFCL into the vitreouscavity postoperatively on two occasions provided a clue to theentrapment of the fluid elsewhere. The choroidal hole becamelarger and prominent with increasing fibrosis. The fibrosis alsoprevented sclerochoroidal approximation in the vicinity of thehole, leading to persistent choroidal detachment in the area intowhich the silicone oil freely migrated.</p><p>In the second case, the hole was identified intraoperatively,only during the second surgery done six months after the injury.The hole presumably formed due to the traction by fibrosis thatcovered the bare sclera/RPE beyond the retinectomy edge, notan uncommon occurrence after large relaxing retinectomies. It ispossible that the areas of choroidal atrophy and thinning can giveway and progressively enlarge to form a choroidal hole in thepresence of significant traction. Presence of silicone oil may not bea special concern but entrapment of PFCL could be problematic,since the surgeon is never sure as to the complete removal of thesame at the conclusion of the surgery. Being heavier than water,PFCL gravitates down and could escape notice.</p><p>These two cases highlight an unreported occurrence ofchoroidal hole formation leading to suprachoroidal collectionof tamponading agents such as PFCL and silicone oil. Both thecases also had hypotony caused possibly by severe fibrosison the ciliary body. The combination of penetrating injuryleading to choroidal damage and the significant proliferativevitreo-retinopathy that is associated with this situation canpotentially lead to choroidal hole formation due to the severetraction. The presence of such a hole can complicate the surgicalmanagement of these eyes.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pieramici</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Sternberg</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Aaberg</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Alfaro</surname><given-names>DV</given-names><suffix>3rd</suffix></name><name><surname>Ligget</surname><given-names>PE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pars plana vitrectomy for penetrating eye injuries</article-title><source>Vitreoretinal surgery of the injured eye</source><year>1999</year><publisher-loc>E.
