The increased deposition of intramyocellular TAG (imTAG) has received special interest, because several studies have demonstrated a positive association between insulin resistance and imTAG storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). Accumulation of imTAG depends on the availability and uptake of fatty acids, the rate of fatty acid oxidation, and the rate of synthesis and hydrolysis of TAG. Increased availability of plasma free fatty acid (FFA) during lipid infusion or high-fat feeding is associated with development of insulin resistance and accumulation of imTAG in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Moreover, studies have shown impaired capacity for fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle from insulin-resistant/type 2 diabetic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>), and reduced mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and myotubes is associated with increased deposition of imTAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Fatty acids may promote insulin resistance via intracellular intermediates such as acyl-CoA, diacylglycerol (DAG), and ceramides, interfering with insulin signaling and glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated positive effects on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) compared with saturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). Very long&#x02013;chain &#x003c9;-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), may protect against skeletal muscle insulin resistance caused by high-fat feeding in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). PUFAs may also promote increased TAG accumulation without impairing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). The sulfur-substituted fatty acid analog tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) is a pan&#x02013;peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor (pan-PPAR) activator that reduces plasma lipids and enhances hepatic fatty acid oxidation in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Dual and pan-PPAR agonists are currently being developed for treatment of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>), and TTA has been shown to improve glucose metabolism in insulin-resistant rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>) and to stimulate mitochondrial proliferation in rat skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). We have recently demonstrated that TTA may increase fatty acid oxidation in human myotubes similar to the PPAR&#x003b4;-specific agonist GW501516 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>).</p><p>Skeletal muscle metabolism is influenced by physical activity, hormonal status, and muscle fiber type, rendering it difficult to determine the impact of EPA and TTA on basal and insulin-stimulated intermediary metabolism. Cultured human myotubes display the morphological, metabolic, and biochemical properties of adult skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>) and offer a unique model to distinguish between genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). We and others have reported several potential intrinsic deficiencies in myotubes from individuals with type 2 diabetes, including lower basal palmitate oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>) and impaired insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). It is unknown whether EPA or TTA may improve insulin resistance or other characteristics of type 2 diabetes, such as decreased lipid oxidation in myotubes.</p><p>To identify the potential effects of EPA and TTA on the intermediary energy metabolism and insulin resistance, we compared the effect of TTA, EPA, and oleic acid in myotubes established from obese individuals with type 2 diabetes and obese healthy subjects.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)-Glutamax, FCS, Ultroser G, penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B, and trypsin-EDTA were obtained from Gibco, Invitrogen (Paisley, U.K.). 2-&#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H(G)&#x0005d;deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-glucose (6.00 Ci/mmol) and <sc>d</sc>-&#x0005b;<sup>14</sup>C(U)&#x0005d;glucose (5 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer, NEN (Boston, MA). &#x0005b;1-<sup>14</sup>C&#x0005d;acetate (55 mCi/mmol), &#x0005b;1-<sup>14</sup>C&#x0005d;PA (55 mCi/mmol), and <sc>d</sc>-&#x0005b;1-<sup>14</sup>C&#x0005d;glucose (55 mCi/mmol) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO).

Stock solutions of fatty acid sodium salts (6 mmol/l) and BSA (2.4 mmol/l) were heated to 45&#x000b0;C and rapidly mixed (molar ratio of 2.5:1). Only optically clear solutions were used. There were no differences between the myotubes after preincubation with fatty acids as evaluated by microscopic inspection searching for floating cells or cells with lipid droplets.

Heptadecanoyl-CoA (33 pmol) and H<sub>2</sub>O were added to a final volume of 800 &#x003bc;l before addition of 3 ml chloroform:methanol (2:1).

Myotubes were preincubated with 100 &#x003bc;mol/l oleic acid for 4 days with addition of 100 &#x003bc;mol/l TTA the last 24 h.

By adding 1 &#x003bc;mol/l insulin acutely, <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid accumulation was further enhanced by 15&#x02013;30&#x00025; (data not shown; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). There was an allover significant 20&#x00025; reduction in <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid&#x02013;derived CO<sub>2</sub> released from type 2 diabetes vs. control myotubes (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), indicating that type 2 diabetes cells exhibit reduced complete palmitic acid oxidation. However, after incubation with TTA, control and type 2 diabetes myotubes showed enhanced <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> production from <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid compared with baseline or preincubation with oleic acid (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>), suggesting that TTA may improve mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The percentage of palmitic acid that was oxidized completely to CO<sub>2</sub> compared with total oxidation &#x0005b;sum of complete (CO<sub>2</sub>) plus incomplete fatty acid oxidation (ASMs)&#x0005d; was lower in type 2 diabetes myotubes, especially after preincubation with TTA (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Preincubation with EPA and TTA enhanced <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid&#x02013;derived ASMs recovered in the media, and the response was significantly stronger in type 2 diabetes myotubes (EPA 125&#x00025; and TTA 128&#x00025;) compared with control myotubes (EPA 45&#x00025; and TTA 47&#x00025;; <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>).

We also observed similar effects of EPA and TTA on ASMs derived from <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;oleic acid, with significantly stronger release from type 2 diabetes than control myotubes in the presence of insulin (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Accumulation of TAG.</title><p>Preincubation of myotubes with oleic acid and EPA enhanced <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid accumulation into lipids compared with baseline by 23&#x02013;32&#x00025; and 29&#x02013;53&#x00025;, respectively (results not shown; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The enhanced lipid accumulation might be explained by a strong increment in TAG accumulation after preincubation with oleic acid (7.4 and 7.9 nmol/mg cell protein, control, and type 2 diabetes, respectively) and EPA (10.9 and 17.5 nmol/mg cell protein, control, and type 2 diabetes, respectively) compared with baseline (results not shown; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The relative increase in TAG accumulation was significantly higher in type 2 diabetes than control myotubes after preincubation with EPA (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Preincubation with TTA did not increase total <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid lipid accumulation, although radiolabeled TAG was slightly increased compared with baseline but reduced compared with oleic acid and EPA (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Similar effects of oleic acid, EPA, and TTA on lipid synthesis were observed using <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;oleic acid (data not shown).

DAG acyltransferase 2 (<italic>DGAT2</italic>), responsible for the final step in TAG synthesis, was increased similarly by all fatty acids in control myotubes, whereas type 2 diabetes myotubes displayed a reduced response, especially during incubation with TTA (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). The nuclear transcription factor PPAR&#x003b3; coactivator &#x003b1; (<italic>PGC1&#x003b1;</italic>) had a similar expression pattern to DGAT2, with enhanced expression after fatty acid preincubation in control cells and reduced response in type 2 diabetes myotubes (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Acyl-CoA fractions.</title><p>Total acyl-CoA was increased relative to baseline after preincubation with TTA, whereas preincubation with EPA reduced acyl-CoA by &#x0003e;40&#x00025; in type 2 diabetes myotubes but significantly less in control cells (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Preincubation with EPA reduced C18:1-CoA by an average of 61&#x00025; (not shown; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and C16:0-CoA by 46&#x02013;55&#x00025; (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>) relative to baseline, whereas C16:1-CoA was markedly increased (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). EPA also substantially reduced the level of C18:2-CoA relative to baseline in type 2 diabetes myotubes, to a level significantly lower than in control myotubes (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>). Preincubation with oleic acid reduced C16:0-CoA by 71&#x02013;82&#x00025; (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>) and increased C18:1-CoA by an average of 75&#x00025; (not shown; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) relative to baseline. TTA-CoA and C16:0-CoA had similar retention times and therefore appeared in the same peak on the chromatogram. The relative increase in acyl-CoA after preincubation with TTA (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>) could be ascribed to a marked increase in the combined TTA/C16:0-CoA peak compared with C16:0-CoA at baseline (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Interestingly, C20:4-CoA was decreased in type 2 diabetes compared with control myotubes after fatty acid preincubations and significantly after TTA (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Glucose metabolism.</title><p>Diabetic myotubes displayed an allover (basal and insulin-stimulated) 10&#x00025; decreased glucose oxidation compared with control cells (results not shown; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

Glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, however, were mostly unaffected by preincubations with fatty acids (data not shown). Thus, preincubation with EPA and TTA may have reduced nonoxidized glucose metabolites like lactate and pyruvate, accounting for the increased glucose oxidation. Moreover, the mRNA expression of <italic>GLUT4</italic>, <italic>GLUT1</italic>, and <italic>HKII</italic> were unchanged after fatty acid preincubations (results not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>TTA inhibits the oleic acid&#x02013;mediated increase of cell-associated <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid.</title><p>We monitored incorporation of <sup>14</sup>C-TTA into complex cellular lipids and found that only a minimal amount was recovered in the TAG fraction, whereas most was found in phospholipids (not shown). De novo synthesis of fatty acids from <sup>14</sup>C-acetate was similar after 4 days of preincubation of myotubes with TTA compared with baseline (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>), but the ratio between radioactivity recovered in DAG and TAG was sevenfold higher after TTA (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). To further elucidate the impact of TTA on cellular fatty acid accumulation, we monitored the time course for cell-associated <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid by scintillation proximity assay (SPA). As expected, 4 days of preincubation with oleic acid caused enhanced cell-associated <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). TTA itself caused no change compared with baseline, and addition of TTA for the last 24 h of the oleic acid preincubation period was sufficient to inhibit the oleic acid&#x02013;mediated increase in cell-associated <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Together, these data suggest that TTA or TTA-CoA may reduce fatty acid&#x02013;stimulated TAG synthesis, possibly by inhibiting DGAT activity as also suggested previously in rat livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Cultured human myotubes is the most similar cell system to intact skeletal muscle that can be modulated ex vivo. Compared with rodent models, they express the right genetic background and the specific skeletal muscle phenotype. The extracellular environment can be controlled precisely and kept relatively constant over time, without interference by systemic homeostatic compensatory mechanisms. We and others have reported several potential intrinsic deficiencies in myotubes from individuals with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). These differences appear most obvious when comparing myotubes established from lean with obese type 2 diabetic subjects but are not always significant when comparing obese with obese type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). We studied the effects of EPA and TTA on the intermediary energy metabolism and insulin resistance in myotubes established from obese subjects with type 2 diabetes and obese healthy subjects. We have previously demonstrated reduced capacity for complete oxidation of labeled palmitic acid to CO<sub>2</sub> in myotubes from obese type 2 diabetic subjects compared with obese control myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>), and this dysfunction was reproduced in our present study. Here, we observed that CO<sub>2</sub> production from labeled palmitic acid was reduced for diabetic myotubes (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic> vs. <italic>B</italic></xref>). Furthermore, the release of fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation products (ASMs) was increased by type 2 diabetes compared with control myotubes after preincubation with fatty acids (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic> vs. <italic>D</italic></xref>). Our data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes myotubes is probably caused by disturbances downstream of fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation leading to excess production and release of ASMs during increased influx and/or &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids. In support for this, several studies have suggested a mitochondrial dysfunction in the etiology of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). Moreover, increased levels of &#x003b2;-oxidation products have been found in both murine skeletal muscle and plasma, probably reflecting mitochondrial overload due to excess availability of fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>).</p><p>Excess FFA taken up by myotubes may either be oxidized or stored as TAG. <italic>PGC1&#x003b1;</italic> is an important regulator of muscle oxidative capacity, mitochondrial content, and fiber type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>), and insulin resistance may be negatively associated with <italic>PGC1&#x003b1;</italic> expression in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>). In the present study, gene expression of <italic>PGC1&#x003b1;</italic> was increased in response to fatty acids, but the relative response was blunted in diabetic myotubes compared with control cells. In C2C12 myotubes, <italic>PGC1&#x003b1;</italic> expression was enhanced after 4 h but reduced after 16 h of incubation with palmitic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>), whereas unsaturated fatty acids like oleic acid and linoleic acid enhanced <italic>PGC1&#x003b1;</italic> expression in human myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). Our data suggest that the reduced capacity for complete mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation observed for type 2 diabetes myotubes might be related to suboptimal responses in expression of <italic>PGC1&#x003b1;</italic>, e.g., when the myotubes are exposed to fatty acids. <italic>DGAT2</italic>, which is involved in TAG formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>), showed a similar expression pattern to <italic>PGC1&#x003b1;</italic>, and the expression of these genes correlated well (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.81, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Reduced <italic>DGAT2</italic> gene expression after preincubation with fatty acids in diabetic cells, together with impaired complete fatty acid oxidation, may contribute to enhanced levels of potentially lipotoxic intracellular fatty acid intermediates and might play a role in lipid-induced insulin resistance.</p><p>Preincubation of myotubes with EPA led to increased production of ASMs, whereas TTA increased both ASMs and CO<sub>2</sub> production (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). Increased formation of &#x003b2;-oxidation intermediates may cause mitochondrial stress and induce skeletal muscle insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). However, we did not observe any detrimental effects of chronic preincubation with either EPA or TTA on insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in human myotubes. This does not exclude any such link, because we did not coincubate with fatty acids during the glucose experiments that might be a prerequisite for negative effects to occur. Nevertheless, Power et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>) showed that supplementation with <sc>l</sc>-carnitine could ameliorate rather than worsen insulin resistance in mice, despite increased levels of &#x003b2;-oxidation products in plasma and skeletal muscle. Furthermore, preincubation with EPA and TTA increased glucose oxidation, suggesting improved instead of reduced capacity for glucose handling (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>).</p><p>Preincubation of myotubes with the naturally occurring fatty acids enhanced <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid uptake in line with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>), and EPA was more effective than oleic acid (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). Preincubation with oleic acid, and especially EPA, also promoted increased incorporation of <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid into TAG, and the response to EPA was more pronounced in diabetic myotubes (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic> vs. <italic>D</italic></xref>). We observed a negative correlation between total fatty acid oxidation and TAG synthesis in the presence of EPA, suggesting that EPA may redirect excess fatty acids into TAG. Storage of excess fatty acids such as TAG may protect against cell damage due to neutralization of lipotoxic intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). Furthermore, EPA reduced the total amount of acyl-CoA, in particular C18:2-CoA, and the reduction was greatest for diabetic myotubes. Increased levels of acyl-CoA and especially C18:2-CoA have been associated with insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). Moreover, EPA markedly increased the level of C16:1-CoA, which has recently been shown to function as a lipokine improving peripheral insulin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>) and glucose metabolism in L6 rat myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>). In addition, incubation of myotubes from normal lean subjects with EPA improved glucose uptake, despite an increased incorporation of <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;oleic acid into TAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). In rats, EPA also improved insulin resistance while increasing imTAG levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>).</p><p>Preincubation with TTA increased complete oxidation of <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid to CO<sub>2</sub> to a similar degree in control and diabetic myotubes. Thus, TTA &#x0201c;restored&#x0201d; complete palmitic acid oxidation in diabetic cells to baseline level of control myotubes (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> vs. <italic>D</italic></xref>). The uptake of palmitic acid was increased after preincubation with TTA but did not lead to similar accumulation of <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid into TAG compared with preincubation with oleic acid or EPA. The reduced TAG accumulation may reflect enhanced fatty acid oxidation, and we have data showing increased TAG accumulation from <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid after TTA preincubation when myotubes were acutely coincubated with the CPT1 inhibitor etomoxir (A.J.W., A.C.R., unpublished observations). Alternatively, TTA-CoA may inhibit DGAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>), as also suggested by the markedly increased cellular DAG-to-TAG recovery ratio of <sup>14</sup>C-acetate in the presence of TTA, without changes in lipid synthesis. Furthermore, we observed that <sup>14</sup>C-TTA itself could not be efficiently incorporated into TAG in human myotubes and that coincubation with TTA prevented the oleic acid&#x02013;induced increase in cell-associated <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid. Moreover, myotubes preincubated with TTA had enhanced levels of acyl-CoA and TTA-CoA probably accounted for most of the difference because 3-thia fatty acids cannot undergo &#x003b2;-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). However, preincubation of myotubes with TTA neither impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake nor glycogen synthesis, whereas glucose oxidation was increased in cells from both donor groups (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>).</p><p>TTA may enhance mitochondrial proliferation in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>), and activation of PPAR nuclear receptors probably mediates much of the effects of TTA on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). Because there were no differences in induction of <italic>CPT1</italic> expression after preincubation with TTA relative to oleic acid and EPA, the enhanced &#x003b2;-oxidation after TTA may be explained by the twofold higher induction of <italic>CD36/FAT</italic> expression. CD36 may facilitate fatty acid transport across the plasma membrane in response to contraction and insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>), but CD36 may also reside on the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>) in colocalization with <italic>CPT1</italic> to facilitate mitochondrial fatty acid influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>). In rats, the PPAR&#x003b3; agonist rosiglitazone increased skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial CD36 amount, but not CPT1 protein expression or activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>), which is in line with our observations. Part of the increased oxidation of <sup>14</sup>C&#x02013;palmitic acid to CO<sub>2</sub> after preincubation with TTA may be related to the increased <italic>UCP2</italic> expression and mitochondrial uncoupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>). Thus, preincubation with the synthetic fatty acid analog TTA enhanced complete fatty acid and glucose oxidation in diabetic myotubes and opposed the increased lipid accumulation observed after preincubation with oleic acid and especially EPA.</p><p>In summary, type 2 diabetes myotubes seem to have an impaired mitochondrial capacity for fatty acid oxidation and glucose (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic> vs. <italic>B</italic></xref>), linked to defects downstream of fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation, leading to increased release of ASMs during high fatty acid availability (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic> vs. <italic>D</italic></xref>). Reduced response of PGC&#x003b1; to fatty acids in diabetic myotubes may be associated with reduced mitochondrial function and reduced DGAT activity, creating lipid intermediates and consequently insulin resistance. TTA and EPA might execute beneficial effects by increasing complete fatty acid oxidation and TAG formation, respectively (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>), thereby improving overall energy metabolism and fatty acid handling in type 2 diabetes skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db08-1043_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db08-1043_db08-1043[1].suppl.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Lipgene (Integrated Project 6th Framework Programme, Food Quality, and Safety; FOOD-CT-2003-505944), Freia Chocolade Fabriks Medical Foundation, The Johan Throne Holst Foundation for Nutrition Research, The Danish Medical Research Council, the Danish Diabetes Association, and the Novo-Nordisk Foundation provided financial support.</p><p>R.K.B. and the University of Bergen, Haukeland University Hospital, are shareholders of THIA MEDICA, which holds patents regarding effects of TTA.
