Oxidative stress is initiated by free radicals, which seek stability through electron pairing with biological macromolecules such as proteins, lipids and DNA in healthy human cells and cause protein and DNA damage along with lipid peroxidation. These changes contribute to cancer, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, ageing and inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. All human cells protect themselves against free radical damage by enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase, or compounds such as ascorbic acid, tocopherol and glutathione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Sometimes these protective mechanisms are disrupted by various pathological processes, and antioxidant supplements are vital to combat oxidative damage. Recently, much attention has been directed towards the development of ethnomedicines with strong antioxidant properties but low cytotoxicities.</p><p><italic>Spondias pinnata </italic>(Linn. f.) Kurz (Family &#x02013; Anacardiaceae) is a deciduous tree distributed in India, Sri Lanka and South-East Asian countries. In India it is commonly seen in the deciduous to semi-evergreen forests of the Western Ghats. The genus <italic>Spondias </italic>includes 17 described species, 7 of which are native to the neotropics and about 10 are native to tropical Asia. The phytochemistry of this plant has been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The gum exudate of the species has been found to contain acidic polysaccharides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A crude extract of <italic>S. pinnata </italic>has been reported to show antibacterial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In ethnomedicine, equal quantities of bark juice of <italic>S. pinnata </italic>and <italic>Syzygium cumuni </italic>are prescribed as a remedy for dysentery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. An aqueous extract of this plant inhibits the citrus canker of lime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, there has been no report on the antioxidant properties of this species.</p><p>The objective of the present study was to evaluate the antioxidant potential and free radical scavenging activity of a 70% methanol extract of <italic>S. pinnata</italic>. The extract was examined for different reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activities including hydroxyl, superoxide, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, singlet oxygen and hypochlorous acid, and for phenol and flavonoid contents, iron chelating capacity and total antioxidant activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany. 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethychroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) was obtained from Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland.

The absorbance of the ABTS<sup>.+ </sup>solution was equilibrated to 0.70 (&#x000b1; 0.02) by diluting with water at room temperature, then 1 ml was mixed with 10 &#x003bc;l of the test sample (0.05&#x02013;10 mg/ml) and the absorbance was measured at 734 nm after 6 min. All experiments were repeated six times. The percentage inhibition of absorbance was calculated and plotted as a function of the concentration of standard and sample to determine the trolox equivalent antioxidant concentration (TEAC).

The reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 1 ml, 2-deoxy-2-ribose (2.8 mM); KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>-KOH buffer (20 mM, pH 7.4); FeCl<sub>3 </sub>(100 &#x003bc;M); EDTA (100 &#x003bc;M); H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(1.0 mM); ascorbic acid (100 &#x003bc;M) and various concentrations (0&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;g/ml) of the test sample or reference compound. After incubation for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C, 0.5 ml of the reaction mixture was added to 1 ml 2.8% TCA, then 1 ml 1% aqueous TBA was added and the mixture was incubated at 90&#x000b0;C for 15 min to develop the color. After cooling, the absorbance was measured at 532 nm against an appropriate blank solution. All tests were performed six times. Mannitol, a classical OH<sup>. </sup>scavenger, was used as a positive control.

Then 1 ml of napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NED) (0.1% w/v) was added and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 25&#x000b0;C. The pink chromophore generated during diazotization of nitrite ions with sulphanilamide and subsequent coupling with NED was measured spectrophotometrically at 540 nm against a blank sample. All tests were performed six times. Curcumin was used as a standard.</p></sec><sec><title>Hydrogen peroxide scavenging</title><p>This activity was determined according to a previously described method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] with minor changes. An aliquot of 50 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and various concentrations (0&#x02013;2 mg/ml) of samples were mixed (1:1 v/v) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature.

An alternative solution to the problem is to consume natural antioxidants from food supplements and traditional medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Recently, many natural antioxidants have been isolated from different plant materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The antioxidant and polyphenol contents of <italic>S. pinnata </italic>have also been determined by Chuyen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], using concentrated leaf extract. The antioxidant activity has been studied by the inhibition of ascorbic acid-induced lipid peroxidation and Catechin has been used as the standard for phenolic content, whereas in the present study, the antioxidant capacity of bark extract was measured by an improved ABTS radical cation decolorization assay and gallic acid was used as the standard for phenolic content measurement; both studies showed promising results. Therefore, it is clear that both the leaf and stem bark extracts of the plant have good antioxidant activities as well as high polyphenolic contents.</p><p>ABTS<sup>.+ </sup>is a blue chromophore produced by the reaction between ABTS and potassium persulfate. Addition of the plant extract to this pre-formed radical cation reduced it to ABTS in a concentration-dependent manner.

They were produced in this study by incubating ferric-EDTA with ascorbic acid and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>at pH 7.4, and reacted with 2-deoxy-2-ribose to generate a malondialdehyde (MDA)-like product.

Robak and Glyglewski [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] reported that flavonoids are effective antioxidants mainly because they scavenge superoxide anions. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the superoxide radical scavenging activities of the plant extract and the reference compound are increased markedly with increasing concentrations.

The present study proved that the extract studied has more potent nitric oxide scavenging activity than the standard curcumin.</p><p>Hydrogen peroxide is a weak oxidizing agent that inactivates a few enzymes directly, usually by oxidation of essential thiol (-SH) groups.
