We have used the established NCI/DTP 60 cell line growth inhibition assay as a platform for exploring the relationship between chemical structure and growth inhibition in both tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cancer cell lines. Using experimental measurements of &#x0201c;take rate&#x0201d; in ectopic implants as a proxy for tumorigenic potential, we identified eight chemical agents that appear to strongly and selectively inhibit the growth of the most tumorigenic cell lines. Biochemical assay data and structure-activity relationships indicate that these compounds act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Yet, their activity against tumorigenic cell lines is more selective than that of the other microtubule inhibitors in clinical use. Biochemical differences in the tubulin subunits that make up microtubules, or differences in the function of microtubules in mitotic spindle assembly or cell division may be associated with the selectivity of these compounds.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The aggressiveness of different kinds of tumor cells derived from human patients can be assessed in terms of their tumorigenic potential in mouse xenograft models.

Most importantly, upon transplantation into immunocompromised mice, tumor-initiating cells can fully reconstitute a tumor with heterogeneity reminiscent of the original tumor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004470-AlHajj1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004470-Singh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the concept of a cancer &#x0201c;stem cell&#x0201d; is still controversial, from a therapeutic standpoint, anticancer agents directed against tumorigenic cancer cells may be the most effective at eradicating tumors.</p><p>The drug discovery and development sector of National Cancer Institute (NCI), the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), has utilized a panel of 60 human tumor-derived cell lines to screen the chemotherapeutic potential of more than 75000 compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004470-Monga1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004470-Teicher1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Different cell lines in the NCI60 panel display a range of tumorigenic potentials upon transplantation into immunocompromised mice. The tumorigenic potential has been recorded as each cell line's &#x0201c;take-rate.&#x0201d;</p><p>As a hypothesis, differences in tumorigenic potential among the NCI cancer cell lines may reflect variations in proliferative activity and tumor-initiating characteristics of the actual cancer cells as they exist in the tumors of cancer patients. Thus, NCI60 cell lines demonstrating high take rate may be more representative of tumor-initiating cancer cells found <italic>in situ</italic>. Here, we identify compounds from the DTP database that are most active against cell lines with the highest take rate, and proceed to establish a putative mechanism of action for these compounds by performing structure-activity relationship studies, and comparing them to standard anticancer agents whose mechanism of action is known. In addition, differences in tumorigenic potential and responsiveness to these agents are shown to be related to differences in gene expression between NCI60 cell lines with high and low tumorigenic potentials, as well as to gene expression markers of tumorigenic cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of selectively cytotoxic compounds</title><p>Growth inhibitory activity in the DTP collection of chemical agents as represented by &#x02212;logGI50 can be compared to the four categories of take-rate using Pearson correlation coefficients.

Thus, we searched for specific genes whose expression may be related to the selective cytotoxic activity of the compounds identified. For this purpose, transcriptional profiling data was mined for genes whose expression across the cell lines correlates with tumorigenic potential. In this data set, we found that take rate is independent of PROML1, CD44, and the log ratio CD44-CD24 in the NCI60 cell lines.

Six named genes and two unnamed genes are expressed at substantially higher levels in the less tumorigenic as compared to the more tumorigenic cell lines on the U95A array platform: PTGIS, JAK1, MGC5560, XPC, NRG1, and SULF1.

Interestingly, Compound 5388755 is structurally related to the potent antitubulin agent Combretastatin A-4. It is also possible that compound 379512 acts by inhibiting tubulin polymerization because several different agents containing the quinolone ring structure have demonstrated antitubulin activity.

Together with their antitubulin activity, the selectivity of our compounds toward highly tumorigenic cell lines suggests that microtubules of tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cell lines may differ. Interestingly, no difference in tubulin gene expression level was observed between highly tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic cell lines.

Differences in tubulin isotype expression and PTMs have been associated with cell differentiation and developmental transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004470-Schatten1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004470-Wilson1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Because microtubules are key to mitotic spindle assembly and cell division, differences in mitotic spindle structure and function between tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cell lines may be associated with the selectivity of these compounds.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a family of microtubule inhibitors that are mostly toxic against tumorigenic cell lines. Established cancer cell lines demonstrating high tumorigenicity in xenograft models may capture some properties of cancer cell subpopulations that are responsible for initiating and spreading the tumors. Therefore, we propose that this family of microtubule inhibitors, or related compounds with similar selectivity characteristics, should be considered as prime candidates for further evaluation as anticancer agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Primary data</title><p>The compound growth inhibition data was obtained from the NCI 60 cell line antitumor screen. The growth inhibitory activity of each compound corresponds to the molar drug concentration required to cause 50&#x00025; growth inhibition (GI50). Most assays use a maximum concentration of 0.0001 M (the cell line screen and GI50 parameter are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004470-Shoemaker1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>). For microarray gene expression analysis, we used five publicly-available data sets for the NCI60 cell lines: triplicate experiments using the Affymetrix U95A platform provided by Novartis, a single U95A data set provided by GeneLogic, and a single Affymetrix U133A/B data set provided by GeneLogic. The GI50 data were obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/docs/cancer/cancer_data.html">http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/docs/cancer/cancer_data.html</ext-link> and all gene expression data were obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/mtargets/download.html">http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/mtargets/download.html</ext-link>.

The experiments and results are provided in the Anticancer Drug Development Guide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004470-Teicher1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. For different cell lines, these data are given either quantitatively or qualitatively, or sometimes as ranges, as the &#x0201c;take rate,&#x0201d; or proportion of attempted implants that yielded a tumor. We converted the take rate data into four ordered categories for analysis: 0 for no growth, 1 for 1&#x02013;60&#x00025; take rate, 2 for 60&#x02013;80&#x00025; take rate and 3 for 80&#x02013;100&#x00025; take rate. Cell lines that overlap two categories are rated at the lower category. For instance, a cell line with 70&#x02013;90&#x00025; take rate is rated as category 3. These ratings of tumorigenic potential are denoted &#x0201c;TP.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Compound selection</title><p>Compounds active against high take-rate cell lines were identified by comparing the growth inhibition measurement (&#x02212;log GI50) to the four-level rating of take-rate, using Pearson correlation. Thresholds of 0.4 and 0.5 were used to define moderate and strong correlations. Statistical significance was assessed by calculating the expected number of compounds out of all compounds tested that would be expected to have a correlation exceeding a given threshold by chance (based on applying Fisher's Z-transformation and using a standard normal reference distribution).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Gene expression analysis</title><p>Compounds active against cell lines that express relatively high levels of PROML1 or CD44-CD24 were identified using Pearson correlation coefficients between &#x02212;log<sub>10</sub>GI50 and either log scale expression of PROML1, or the difference between log scale expression levels of CD44 and CD24. PROML1 is represented by a unique probeset on both platforms, CD44 is represented by two U95A probesets and by six U133A/B probesets, and CD24 is represented by one U95A probeset and by six U133A/B probesets. When multiple probesets are available, all are analyzed separately, and differences among all pairs of CD44/CD24 probesets are analyzed separately. For all analyses, compounds for which fewer than 50 cell lines had a GI50 value, or which had no variability in their GI50 values, were excluded from our analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Standard anticancer agents</title><p>A set of 168 compounds with anticancer activity was compiled, and a subset of 121 of them was annotated according to their presumed mechanism of action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004470-Boyd1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004470-vanOsdol1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.
