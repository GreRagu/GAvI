It has been proposed that excessive and unregulated dopaminergic stimulation of host post-synaptic striatal neurons by the grafts could be responsible for these dyskinesias. To address this issue we transplanted foetal dopaminergic neurons from mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DATKO) or from wild-type mice, into a rat model of Parkinson's disease and <sc>l</sc>-dopa-induced dyskinesias. Both wild-type and DATKO grafts reinnervated the host striatum to a similar extent, but DATKO grafts produced a greater and more diffuse increase in extra-cellular striatal dopamine levels. Interestingly, grafts containing wild-type dopaminergic neurons improved parkinsonian signs to a similar extent as DATKO grafts, but provided a more complete reduction of <sc>l</sc>-dopa induced dyskinesias. Neither DATKO nor wild-type grafts induced OFF-<sc>l</sc>-dopa dyskinesias. Behavioural and receptor autoradiography analyses demonstrated that DATKO grafts induced a greater normalization of striatal dopaminergic receptor supersensitivity than wild-type grafts. Both graft types induced a similar downregulation and normalization of <italic>PEnk</italic> and <italic>fosb/&#x00394;fosb</italic> in striatal neurons. In summary, DATKO grafts causing high and diffuse extra-cellular dompamine levels do not <italic>per se</italic> alter graft-induced recovery or produce OFF-<sc>l</sc>-dopa dyskinesias. Wild-type dopaminergic neurons appear to be the most effective neuronal type to restore function and reduce <sc>l</sc>-dopa-induced dyskinesias.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>transplantation</kwd><kwd>dyskinesia</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><sc>l</sc>-dopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) are the most disabling side-effects of pharmacological treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease (Fahn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2003</xref>). According to the most accepted hypothesis, LIDs are caused by the pulsatile, non-physiological dopaminergic stimulation of denervated striatal medium spiny neurons during chronic <sc>l</sc>-dopa therapy (for review see Olanow <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2006</xref>). Studies in the 6-OHDA rat model of Parkinson's disease have demonstrated that LID are associated with alterations of synaptic plasticity in corticostriatal synapses (Picconi <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2003</xref>). <sc>l</sc>-dopa treatment restores striatal long-term potentiation (LTP) lost after dopaminergic denervation, but in rats with LID these synapses do not depotentiate following LTP (Picconi <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2003</xref>). Various pieces of evidence have linked striatal LTP and synaptic depotentiation with the activity of D1 and NMDA receptors (Chase and Oh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2000</xref>; Oh and Chase, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2002</xref>). Additionally, these aberrant responses have been associated with upregulation of preproenkephalin (PEnk) (Fisher <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1991</xref>), prodynorphin (PDyn), and with changes in gene expression of fosB/&#x00394;fosB-related transcription factors in the post-synaptic striatal neurons (Cenci <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">1998</xref>; Andersson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1999</xref>; Lundblad <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2004</xref>; Pavon <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2006</xref>).</p><p>Intrastriatal foetal ventral mesencephalic (VM) transplantation can be effective in improving both parkinsonian signs and LID in patients with Parkinson's disease (Lindvall <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">1994</xref>; Olanow <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2003</xref>; Mendez <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2005</xref>). In rodent models, foetal grafted dopaminergic neurons restore regulated dopamine (DA) release (Strecker <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">1987</xref>; Forni <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1989</xref>; Di Loreto <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">1996</xref>; Stromberg <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2000</xref>; Bjorklund and Isacson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2002</xref>), and normalize the expression of <italic>fos/&#x00394;fosB</italic>-related genes, <italic>PEnk</italic> and <italic>PDyn</italic> (Lee <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2000</xref>; Maries <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>) in striatal areas reinervated by the graft. These biochemical effects re-establish a balanced striatal neurotransmission in areas reinervated by the grafts, which are associated with significant behavioural improvements (Lee <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2000</xref>; Steece-Collier <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2003</xref>; Maries <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>). Surprisingly, double-blind clinical trials of human VM transplantation showed lack of efficacy in some groups of grafted Parkinson's disease patients, and the presence of a form of OFF-<sc>l</sc>-dopa dyskinesia (Freed <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2001</xref>; Olanow <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2003</xref>). It was proposed that excessive and unregulated production of DA from grafted foetal neurons affecting non-reinervated striatal areas could be responsible for the generation of the OFF-<sc>l</sc>-dopa dyskinesias (Freed <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2001</xref>; Maries <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>), but the molecular mechanisms underlying these side-effects are not known. To address this issue we have implanted reuptake-deficient dopaminergic neurons in the striatum of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.</p><p>The dopamine transporter (DAT) plays a major role in the regulation of DA handling at striatal synapses, and mice lacking the DA transporter have a 5-fold increase in basal striatal extracellular DA levels due to the absence of reuptake (Jones <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">1998<italic>a</italic></xref>). These high levels are possible because neither degradative enzymes nor other monoamine transporters can compensate for the lack of reuptake thereby decreasing the rate of DA clearance from the extra-cellular space by about 300 times (Jones <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">1998<italic>a</italic></xref>). In this scenario, each DA molecule released has a much longer diffusion range (up to several milimetres) (Jones <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">1998<italic>a</italic></xref>). Due to this lack of reuptake, and despite an increased synthesis rate, pre-synaptic DA levels inside the terminals are &#x0003c;10% of normal levels, leading to a dramatic reduction of the DA pool available for depolarization-evoked release (Jones <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">1998<italic>a</italic></xref>).</p><p>In order to investigate the consequences of an excessive and poorly regulated dopaminergic striatal reinervation from foetal grafts, we used the transplantation of foetal VM cells from DATKO mice into the striatum of 6-OHDA-lesioned, <sc>l</sc>-dopa-primed dyskinetic rats. Behavioural studies, <italic>in vivo</italic> microdialysis, receptor autoradiography and molecular and histological analyses were carried out to compare the functional effects of DA replacement therapy based on the re-introduction of DA synapses with either a wild-type profile of DA release and uptake, or a situation in which a disrupted uptake of DA by the implanted neurons induced high extra-synaptic DA levels in denervated, <sc>l</sc>-dopa-primed dyskinetic rats.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Adult female Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesions (medial forebrain bundle injections; Charles River Breeding Laboratories.

Eight weeks post-tx, graft survival was assessed by amphetamine and paw-reaching tests. Rats showing graft-mediated behavioural recovery, and 6-OHDA-lesioned controls were used for <italic>in vivo</italic> microdialysis. Ten weeks post-tx, two dialysis probes (3&#x02009;mm membrane length, 0.24&#x02009;mm external diameter, Cuprophane, 6&#x02009;kDa cut-off, CMA-11; CMA/Microdialysis, Solna, Sweden) were attached to the stereotaxic frame with the tips separated by 2&#x02009;mm and implanted into the grafted striatum. The posterior probe was implanted lateral and anterior to the posterior graft at coordinates AP 0, M-L &#x02212;4, D-V &#x02212;6.5 relative to bregma. The anterior probe was implanted 2 mm anterior to the posterior probe (1.6&#x02009;mm anterior and 1&#x02009;mm lateral to the anterior graft). Twenty-four hours after surgery, the dialysis probes were connected to a syringe pump and perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) (NaCl 147&#x02009;mM, KCl 2.7&#x02009;mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.2&#x02009;mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.85&#x02009;mM; CMA Microdialysis).

Both graft types reduced LID compared with sham surgical controls.

These conclusions and findings are discussed in detail below.</p><sec><title>Integration of foetal VM grafts in the denervated striatum</title><p>Neural transplantation provides a new approach to Parkinson's disease therapy based on the idea that new neurons can provide functional neurotransmission and structural reconstruction of circuitry. DA replacement by neural transplantation is produced by newly generated terminals of grafted neurons into the denervated striatum, which contrast with the classic pharmacological approaches based on the unregulated effects of dopaminergic dugs in the striatum. Early work in the field demonstrated that foetal donor neurons can orient axonal growth towards their normal synaptic targets due to the presence of specific guidance cues in the adult host brain (Isacson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">1995</xref>; Isacson and Deacon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">1996</xref>). More specifically, recent studies in rats (Thompson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2005</xref>), monkeys (Redmond <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2008</xref>) and Parkinson's disease patients (Mendez <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2005</xref>) have shown that different types of dopaminergic neurons (A9/SNc and A10/VTA neurons) with specific distribution within foetal grafts are able to reinervate their natural targets in the denervated striatum. Moreover ultrastructural studies of synapses formed by transplanted foetal dopaminergic neurons on host striatal medium spiny neurons indicate that these new synapses have a normal morphology and similar location within medium spiny neurons, although compared to normal striatum they show an increased tendency to be located on dendritic shafts rather than on dendritic spines (Freund <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">1985</xref>; Bolam <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1987</xref>). Additionally, these new terminals provide a hyperinnervation of striatal cholinergic interneurons but it remains to be determined whether such changes are detrimental, or possibly result in a more efficacious synaptic transmission as postulated by Freund <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">1984</xref>). Finally, microdialysis and electrophysiological studies have revealed the presence of normal pre- and post-synaptic control mechanisms in these newly generated synapses (Zetterstrom <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">1986</xref>; Strecker <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">1987</xref>; Fisher <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1991</xref>). As predicted by all these observations, foetal cell transplantation has been shown to reduce motor deficits in animal models (Perlow <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">1979</xref>; Bjorklund <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">1982</xref>; Redmond <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2008</xref>) and Parkinson's disease patients (Freed <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1992</xref>; Lindvall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">1998</xref>; Hauser <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1999</xref>; Piccini <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1999</xref>; Mendez <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2005</xref>). Unexpectedly, recent double-blind clinical trials in grafted Parkinson's disease patients showed cases of lack of efficacy and the occurrence of OFF-<sc>l</sc>-dopa dyskinesias (Freed <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2001</xref>; Olanow <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2003</xref>). These trials have revealed a need for in-depth studies of the physiological and molecular changes caused by dopaminergic denervation and chronic <sc>l</sc>-dopa therapy, and the effects of foetal grafts in this altered corticostriatal motor circuitry.</p></sec><sec><title>Striatal DATKO and wild-type foetal transplantation induce different improvements of parkinsonian signs</title><p>Both graft types induced a full recovery of spontaneous motor performance as demonstrated by the lack of side bias in the paw-reaching test, but pharmacological tests showed important differences in the functional impact of wild-type as compared to DATKO grafts. Amphetamine administration in animals that received wild-type grafts induced a marked reduction of the ipsilateral rotations seen pre-transplantation, and the appearance of contralateral rotations. In contrast DATKO grafted animals showed an almost complete recovery of amphetamine-induced rotations without the occurrence of overcompensatory contralateral rotations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/awn192/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>). Microdialysis experiments demonstrated a 4-fold increase in DA levels in the wild-type grafted striatum after amphetamine administration. This is in agreement with previous studies of <italic>in vivo</italic> microdialysis in grafted, 6-OHDA-lesioned rats (Zetterstrom <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">1986</xref>; Herman <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">1993</xref>). As expected, due to the need of DAT for amphetamine-mediated release (Jones <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">1998<italic>b</italic></xref>), microdialysis experiments confirmed that in DATKO grafted animals amphetamine administration induced a minimal increase of striatal DA. This increase was of similar magnitude to that seen in denervated controls and probably originated in the remaining host terminals. Thus, as extra-cellular DA levels prior to amphetamine were 3-fold higher in DATKO grafted striatum; extra-cellular DA levels after amphetamine administration were similar in both grafted groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). The overcompensatory rotational response in wild-type grafted animals to amphetamine administration reflects an excessive activity of the grafted striatum, probably related to post-synaptic supersensitivity of non-reinervated striatal neurons, that are stimulated by DA released by the graft in response to amphetamine that diffuses to non-reinervated striatal areas. The lack of contralateral rotations in animals with DATKO grafted neurons despite the presence of similar extra-cellular DA levels compared to wild-type grafts, suggests that the high DA levels created by DATKO grafts also reached non-reinervated striatal areas producing a permanent reduction of DA receptor supersensitivity in these areas. This reduction in DA receptor supersensitivity seen in DATKO grafted animals is most likely due to the increase in the striatal volume covered by DA released by each terminal, resulting in volume transmission as described in DATKO mice (Jones <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">1998<italic>a</italic></xref>). Consistent with this, contralateral rotations in response to the full DA agonist apomorphine were significantly but not completely reversed by wild-type grafts (60% reduction), whereas animals grafted with DATKO cell suspensions showed an almost complete recovery of contralateral apomorphine-induced rotations. This indicates that wild-type VM grafts normalize DA transmission in reinervated but not in non-reinervated areas (as shown in Stromberg <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2000</xref>), whereas DATKO grafts (that reinervated &#x0223c;40% of the denervated striatum) normalized DA receptor activity beyond the reinervated areas.</p><p>These differences between the effects of wild-type and DATKO grafts in striatal DA receptors were in part explained by receptor binding analysis of striatal DA D1 and D2 receptors, which showed that while both graft types induced a significant downregulation of DA receptors compared with denervated controls, DATKO grafts had a more complete effect on DA receptors in areas around the graft, and a larger area of DA receptor downregulation. This effect on DA receptors was likely mediated both by DA reinervation and by the high extra-cellular levels of DA generated by the graft that reached non-reinnervated striatal areas by volume transmission, and normalized the activity of extrasynaptic DA receptors (Yung <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">1995</xref>), and subsequently also improved drug-induced behaviours. The normalization of amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced responses with partial recovery of LID seen in DATKO-grafted animals (see below) indicates that this improvement, mediated by diffusion of extra-cellular DA to distant neurons, does not reflect a full structural and functional recovery of corticostriatal transmission. Supporting this idea, electrophysiological studies have shown partial normalizations in DA receptor activity in areas not reinervated by the grafts (Stromberg <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2000</xref>). Additionally, the current work and other studies (Fisher <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">1991</xref>; Lane <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2006</xref>) show that foetal VM grafts can induce some improvements in amphetamine-induced rotational behaviours before grafted foetal neurons fully reinervate striatal neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Both wild-type and DATKO grafts improved LIDs and did not induce OFF-<sc>l</sc>-dopa dyskinesias</title><sec><title>OFF-<sc>l</sc>-dopa dyskinesias</title><p>6-OHDA-lesioned rats not primed with <sc>l</sc>-dopa and grafted with wild-type or DATKO cells did not show any sign of OFF- <sc>l</sc>-dopa dyskinesias, even when 500&#x02009;000 cells were grafted per animal. In the rat model of LID, fully denervated animals show a high sensitivity to the fluctuations of extra-cellular DA induced by <sc>l</sc>-dopa treatment (Dethy <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1999</xref>), often showing dyskinetic behaviours even after the first <sc>l</sc>-dopa dose (Winkler <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2002</xref> and Vinuela <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished data). This effect is even more dramatic when <sc>l</sc>-dopa is administered directly in the striatum of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats (Carta <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2006</xref>). In the present study, the permanently high extra-cellular DA levels produced by large DATKO grafts did not induce any type of spontaneous dyskinesias. Moreover, the lack of dyskinesias in animals grafted with large DATKO grafts, with the subsequent high extra-cellular DA levels in areas not reinervated by foetal DA fibres, supports the notion that tightly regulated DA release from foetal grafts does not produce spontaneous abnormal movements by itself.</p><p>A detailed study of spontaneous and stress-induced OFF- <sc>l</sc>-dopa behaviours only revealed mild dyskinetic behaviours during the first weeks post-tx and they were of the same magnitude and distribution in the transplantation groups and in <sc>l</sc>-dopa-primed sham surgical controls.

In previous studies of OFF- <sc>l</sc>-dopa dyskinesias and foetal VM transplantation in this rat model, only one reported mild spontaneous dyskinetic behaviours in the first weeks post-tx (Lane <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2006</xref>), but after these early stages none of the studies reported spontaneous dyskinesias (Lee <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2000</xref>; Steece-Collier <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2003</xref>; Carlsson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2006</xref>; Lane <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2006</xref>; Maries <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>). The occurrence of these early dyskinetic behaviours is, most likely, related to processes of cell maturation and integration and with surgery-related events.</p><p>The possibility of OFF-<sc>l</sc>-dopa dyskinesias after striatal foetal VM cell transplantation has been underscored by two recent double-blind clinical trials testing the efficacy of fetal VM cell transplantation as solid pieces into the striatum of Parkinson's disease patients (Freed <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2001</xref>; Olanow <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2003</xref>). As a possible explanation for these dyskinesias, it has been suggested that small grafts would produce &#x02018;hot spots&#x02019; of striatal DA reinervation, that would normalize striatal supersensitivity in a limited area and at the same time would give rise to a &#x02018;spill-over&#x02019; of DA, released in a non-regulated neuro-humoral manner (Freed <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2001</xref>; Hagell and Cenci, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2005</xref>; Maries <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>). This unregulated DA release would reach supersensitive receptors in striatal areas not reinervated by the graft and generate abnormal movements. This possibility has been also examined by transplantation studies in rodents that linked this graft-mediated effect on supersensitive post-synaptic terminals, with an incomplete focal pattern of striatal reinervation by these grafts. In contrast, such &#x02018;hot spots&#x02019; described using PET (Ma <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2002</xref>), were not correlated with the occurrence of OFF- <sc>l</sc>-dopa dyskinesias in other clinical studies (Hagell <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2002</xref>). In the current study, microdialysis demonstrated that high DA levels released by DATKO grafts cover almost all striatum, also involving striatal areas not reinervated by the graft. Notably, this situation, which resembles a neurohumoral DA release, did not elicit OFF- <sc>l</sc>-dopa dyskinesias. The lack of dyskinesias and other behavioural changes in DATKO grafted rats, despite the presence of high striatal extra-cellular DA levels, contrast with the severe side-effects seen in Parkinson's disease patients after intraventricular injection of DA. These patients showed different combinations of dyskinesias, myoclonic jerks, severe depression and psychotic behaviours that disappeared when DA infusion was discontinued (Venna <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">1984</xref>). A similar response has been reported in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats in which intrastriatal infusion of <sc>l</sc>-dopa elicited LID even in non- <sc>l</sc>-dopa-primed rats (Carta <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2006</xref>). In conclusion, our findings indicate high extra-cellular DA levels produced by striatal foetal grafts may not be responsible for the generation of OFF- <sc>l</sc>-dopa dyskinesias, even when they diffuse to non-reinervated striatal areas. Other aspects of these trials related with the surgical technique or cell preparation, and the striatal lesion and inflammation induced by them, are more likely to be related with this unexpected side-effect.</p></sec><sec><title>LIDs</title><p>Both graft types produced an overall reduction in LID compared to sham surgical controls. These results, and those of previous studies using wild-type rat cell suspensions (Lee <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2000</xref>; Carlsson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2006</xref>; Lane <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2006</xref>; Maries <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2006</xref>) indicate that striatal foetal neural transplantation reduces LID when sufficient striatal DA reinervation and synaptic regeneration is achieved. In the presence of local mechanisms of regulation of DA release, presynaptic DA terminals from the graft take up <sc>l</sc>-dopa, decarboxylate it to DA and in the case of wild-type neurons, release it in a physiologically normal manner (see our microdialysis data and Zetterstrom <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">1986</xref>). This contrasts with the situation in the denervated striatum without transplants, where <sc>l</sc>-dopa is decarboxylated in serotonin terminals, glial cells and blood vessels and DA is released in a non-regulated way primarily as a function of fluctuating levels of <sc>l</sc>-dopa, therefore exposing hypersensitive post-synaptic terminals to pulsatile DA levels (Djaldetti <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1996</xref>) leading to LID (Stocchi <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2005</xref>). Critical to understanding the neurobiology of dyskinesia in the context of DA transmission, dyskinesia reduction was also seen in DATKO grafted animals, which emphasizes the possibility that appropriate and complete striatal DA reinervation and not DA extra-cellular levels is the key factor for functional recovery and reduction of existing LID. New DATKO graft derived DA terminal networks in the host striatum re-establish synaptic function, yet DA levels are 10-fold higher than in the striatum of 6-OHDA lesion alone, and 3-fold higher than in the wild-type grafted striatum. In this situation of lack of reuptake, a dose of <sc>l</sc>-dopa induced a dramatic increase of extra-cellular DA, that was more pronounced than that seen in non-grafted denervated animals (see Results section and Dethy <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1999</xref>). Notably, wild-type grafts induced a significantly larger reduction of LID compared to DATKO grafted animals, which contrast with the broader and more complete down regulation of DA receptors, amphetamine and apomorphine tests by DATKO grafts. A possible explanation for this difference between wild-type and DATKO grafts would be that the neurotransmission provided by grafted wild-type dopaminergic neurons is likely to be more precise, and would have a more A9-(SNc-) like autoinhibition of DA levels, similar to normal or homeostatic DA levels at the terminals in the striatum, whereas DATKO neurons would mimic an A10- (VTA-) like neurotransmission, given that VTA dopaminergic neurons express both less DAT and D2 autoreceptors. Interestingly, dyskinesia reduction was linked in both graft types to similar reductions of the abnormally upregulated expressions of PEnk and fosB/&#x00394;fosB (that parallels PDyn mRNA expression; Steiner and Gerfen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">1998</xref>; Andersson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1999</xref>), markers of the activity of indirect and direct striatal output pathways, respectively. Both graft types induced similar reductions in NMDA receptors in the post-synaptic elements. This, and the fact that DATKO grafts induce only a partial improvement of LID, support the possibility that while DA alone is able to induce a downregulation of DA receptor supersensitivity, the presence of new functional DA presynaptic terminals may be necessary to revert the maladaptative synaptic plasticity processes that occur in medium spiny neurons as a result of dopaminergic denervation and chronic <sc>l</sc>-dopa treatment that are related to the development of LID (Cenci <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">1998</xref>; Andersson <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1999</xref>; Calabresi <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2000</xref>; Nash and Brotchie, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2002</xref>; Oh and Chase, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2002</xref>; Lundblad <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2004</xref>; Pavon <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2006</xref>). Our results also emphasize the therapeutic importance of reducing the impact of pulsatile DA levels produced by <sc>l</sc>-dopa administration (Stocchi <italic>et al</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2005</xref>) by providing local and regulated DA transmission where available post-synaptic DA receptor terminal function can compensate and prevent abnormal transmission in the dendritic spines of striatal medium spiny neurons, even in the absence of pre-synaptic reuptake of DA. Notably, the presence in both graft types of &#x0223c;35% of serotoninergic neurons did not lead to the worsening of LID or to the occurrence of OFF-dyskinesia.</p><p>Based on these findings we propose that despite the capacity of extra-cellular DA to correct many aspects of striatal DA neurotransmission acting through extra-synaptic sites, the presence of terminals from the dopaminergic neurons that can regulate DA release locally provides a more complete correction of the changes in the circuitry in response to dopaminergic denervation and chronic <sc>l</sc>-dopa treatment. In addition, the use of DA reuptake deficient cells reveals that DA terminals from the grafts provide functional recovery even in the presence of abnormally high extra-cellular DA levels. These findings suggest that DA terminals, and not DA levels <italic>per se</italic>, restore function in an animal model of Parkinson's disease.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Supplementary
