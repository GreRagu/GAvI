Theyresemble cortical opacities, which often cannot be brokenby a single hydrodissection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> The operating surgeon shouldconsider the presence of CCA during cataract surgery. This isbecause when CCA are present, nucleus rotation during cataractsurgery is not only difficult but may prove to be impossible aswell.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Furthermore, unsuccessful efforts to rotate the nucleusdue to the presence of CCA can even result in zonular stretchor damage. In eyes with CCA, forceful rotation of the lens islikely to result in a break in the integrity of the capsular zonularcomplex.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> When CCA are present, we strongly recommendperforming a judicious combination of multiquadrant and focalhydrodissection to cleave these adhesions apart and remove amajor obstacle to phacoemulsification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Thus, identification offactors associated with the development of CCA can be helpfulin appropriately modifying the surgical procedure so as toreduce morbidity. Keeping these in mind, the present study wasdesigned to evaluate the probable associations with CCA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a single observational case-control study undertakenat our clinic during the period April 2004 to November 2004.Healthy eyes with uncomplicated cataracts in the age groupof 45 years onwards were included in the study. Eyes withcoexisting ocular pathology, traumatic cataracts, previousocular surgeries, pupil &#x02264;6 mm that precluded full dilation andpersons in whom slit-lamp lens evaluation was not possiblewere excluded from the study.</p><p>In this prospective case-control study, we decided on asample size of 200 patients with CCA (cases) based on our earlierstudy, which reported a 30% incidence of CCA. To achieve thetarget of recruiting 600 patients for the study, we examined760 consecutive patients with cataract who were scheduled forsurgery within the stipulated period [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Flow plan 1</xref>]. For analysisthere were 580 patients, 189 patients with CCA (cases) and 391patients without CCA (controls).</p><p>Each patient signed a consent form before enrolling in thestudy. All the patients were subjected to a thorough slit-lampexamination. Each eye was dilated with 1% tropicamide eyedrops three times at 15-min intervals or till the pupillarydilation was 7 mm or more in diameter. A trained singleobserver recorded the observations for each eye for thepresence and severity of specific lens opacity. The procedurefor assessment of cataract in the present study is describedhere. The type of cataract was categorized in the followingmanner: T1: nuclear, T2: anterior cortical, T3: posterior cortical,T4: posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC). Grading of nucleibased on degree of hardness was done according to the Emeryand Little classification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Presence of CCA was documentedwith the slit-lamp at 12&#x000d7; magnification with maximumillumination and the slit beam focused on the capsule at a 30&#x000b0;to 45&#x000b0; angle. Corticocapsular adhesions appeared as an opacityin the outermost layer of the cortex with no visible area oftranslucence between the capsule and the underlying opaquecortical layer [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>]. However, during slit-lamp examination,cortical cataract should be differentiated from CCA. In corticalcataract, a distinct area of translucence is always visible in theinner substance of the lens [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>].</p><p>A single surgeon did phacoemulsification under topicalanesthesia using a standardized surgical technique. Aftercapsulorrhexis, either single site corticocleaving hydrodissectionor, if nucleus rotation was not possible, additional focal andmultiquadrant hydrodissection was performed. A deep centraltrench was sculpted and the nucleus was divided into multiplesmall fragments using the step-by-step chop <italic>in situ</italic> and lateralseparation technique.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> The fragments were emulsified usingthe stop, chop, chop and stuff technique<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> and the step downtechnique.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> However, in soft cataracts, nucleotomies wereperformed after sculpting followed by fragment removal byphacoaspiration. Intraoperative confirmation of CCA wasfurther done by visualization of a furry surface of cortex duringresidual cortex removal.</p><p>The following criteria were applied to eyes to considertheir inclusion as cases: (i) preoperative presence of CCA onslit-lamp examination with visualization of furry surface ofcortex during surgery; (ii) preoperative absence of CCA onslit-lamp examination but intraoperative visualization offurry surface of cortex. A trained person, who was unawareof the status of the participants in terms of cases and controls,collected the data. The associations were documented for CCA.The associations evaluated were age, gender, type of cataract,grade of nuclear sclerosis, pathologic myopia and presence ofdiabetes mellitus.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Considering the fact that various factors coexisted and therewas interdependence between them, to assess the probabilityof occurrence of CCA with changes in independent variables,multivariate logistic regression analysis was adopted. Thedependent variable occurrence of CCA was dichotomous, withCode 0 for nonoccurrence and Code 1 for occurrence of CCA. Theassociations evaluated were age, gender, type of cataract, gradeof nuclear sclerosis, pathologic myopia and presence of diabetesmellitus. SYSTAT statistical package (Version 8.0) for Windows(SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We could predict the presence of CCA correctly in 98% of ourpopulation. All cases fulfilled our first inclusion criterion.The mean age of the subjects was 64.71 &#x000b1; 9.10 years (range40 to 88 years) in cases and 59.27 &#x000b1; 8.79 years (range 40 to 77years) in controls. Of 580 patients, 318 were males and 262females. Of 318 male subjects, 93 (29.2%) had CCA; of 262female subjects, 96 (36.6%) had CCA. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> represents theincidence of CCA by age and gender in cases and controls. Inthe age group of 40 to 49 years (n = 59), 22% had CCA whilein the age group of 70 to 79 years (n = 110), 70% had CCA. Asage increased the occurrence of CCA also increased [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table1</xref>]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjustingfor the impact of other factors, revealed that the probabilityof occurrence of CCA increased by 3.3% with advancing age(OR = 3.3%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.028), while the odds of CCA for femaleswas 83% higher than that for males (<italic>P</italic> = 0.027). <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>shows the prevalence of different types of cataracts in casesand controls. Owing to the prevalence of mixed cataracts in96% of eyes with CCA, for the purpose of analysis, type ofcataract implicated the presence of opacity irrespective of thecoexistence of other types. There were 17 eyes with Grade 5nuclear sclerosis in cases, while none in the control group.Owing to the small and unequal sample size, the 17 eyeswere grouped as Grade 4 factor in the CCA group. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>shows the incidence of CCA in cases and controls based ontype of cataract (alone or in combination), grade of cataract,pathological myopia and presence of diabetes mellitus. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table4</xref> shows the multivariate analysis. For logistic regression, themodel pseudo R square represented by Nagelkerke <italic>R</italic> squarewas 0.604, which was strong enough and the overall correctprediction was 84.8%. Presence of anterior cortical cataractincreased the odds of CCA by 9.5 times (<italic>P</italic>=0.001), while thepresence of posterior cortical cataract increased the odds ofCCA by 3.3 times (<italic>P</italic>=0.001). There was no association betweengrade of cataract and CCA. Diabetes mellitus showed a weakassociation with CCA. An increase in the axial length by1 mm reduced the odds of CCA by 12% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.029). Presenceof cortical opacity emerged as a significant factor contributingto the increased risk of CCA. A comparison of the incidenceof cortical opacities in the CCA group with respect to age andgender is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>. In eyes with cortical opacities(n = 255 patients), 65.5% had CCA (167/255). Of the 167 patientswith CCA, there were 106 females over 55 years (63.5%). Inthe present study, 138 patients had diabetes and 442 patientsdid not have diabetes. Of the 138 patients with diabetes, 71patients (51.4%) had cortical cataracts. Of these, 64 patients(90.1%) had CCA. While in the 442 patients without diabetes,268 patients (60.6%) had cortical cataracts. Of these, only 121patients (45.1%) had CCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In an initial pilot study we had reported the incidenceof CCA as 20% in 180 consecutive patients undergoingphacoemulsification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Later, in a prospective study, 264 patientsscheduled for phacoemulsification were preoperativelyassessed for the presence of CCA and the incidence wasfound to be 30.3%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> In the same study, the presence of CCAwas found to be a significant factor producing a snag duringphacoemulsification. Increased awareness about the conditionand diligent efforts to notice the same could probably be thereason for the increased detection of CCA. Corticocapsularadhesions are probably rarely seen in industrialized countries.This could be because surgery to remove age-related cataractsis done at a relatively early stage. A number of epidemiologicalstudies on risk factors associated with cataract developmenthave been conducted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> Although high blood pressure,age and diabetes mellitus have been enumerated to be associatedwith the development of cataract, their role in the genesis ofCCA is largely unknown. In the present study, the incidenceof CCA was found to be higher in elderly patients. It hasbeen hypothesized that when mitotically active equatoriallens epithelial cells (LEC) proliferate and migrate either tothe anterior or posterior region of the lens, the accumulationof secretory extracellular material results in the formation ofCCA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> The extracellular protein turnover is more in equatorialLECs compared to anterior LECs which could be the most likelyplace for the origin of CCA. We speculate that the presenceof CCA could be attributed to the accumulation of secretoryextracellular material due to advancing age.</p><p>In the present study the criterion for cases was based onintraoperative visualization of furry surface of cortex duringepinucleus and cortex removal with or without preoperativepresence of CCA on slit-lamp examination rather than on failureto achieve hydrodissection or rotation because the causes forthe latter are multifactorial and the observations could besubjective [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, presence of CCA was found to be greaterin female subjects. A case-control studies that considered anumber of potential cataractogenic risk factors has also reportedthat women are at an increased risk for cortical cataracts only.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> Ina population-based prevalence survey in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin,women had more cortical opacities compared to men in similarage groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> The increased inclination to develop corticalcataracts in women could predispose to the development of CCA.We speculate that some hormonal influences may be responsiblefor the increased incidence of CCA in females. However, thisassociation between the occurrence of CCA and the femalegender requires further investigation and explanation.</p><p>In the present study, the occurrence of CCA was found tobe higher in cortical cataracts and mixed cataracts while theassociation was negligible in isolated cataracts. The significantlyincreased association of developing CCA with cortical cataractsprobably indicates the common etiological basis for CCA andcortical cataracts. This speculation on the impact of corticalcataract on CCA awaits verification and further investigationsin a more controlled manner.</p><p>We did not find any association between grade of cataractand CCA and we attribute this to the inadequate sample size.Our clinical experience and observations suggest an increasedassociation between CCA and dense cataracts. However,further work in this area is warranted before establishing adefinitive association. In the present study, with axial length(AXL) &#x0003c; 25.5 mm the association of CCA declined by 12%. Theassociation of CCA with nuclear cataract and PSC was minimaland we speculate the association of CCA to be low due to absenceof cortical cataract development in high myopia. Cross-sectionaldata from the studies has provided evidence suggestive of anassociation between high myopia and both nuclear cataractand PSC but not cortical cataract.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> In the presentseries, the association between diabetes mellitus and CCA did not attainstatistical significance. However, within the diabetic group, thepresence of CCA was 90.3% in subjects with cortical cataracts.Diabetes has been reported to be significantly associated withcortical cataracts,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> as well as with nuclear opacities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> Webelieve that CCA could be closely associated with diabetesalthough this has not been statistically proven in our results.If we had recruited equal number of individuals with diabetesrelative to the non-diabetic population, we probably could haveachieved statistical significance. Our observation that diabeteshas a common association for CCA, appears true since diabetesmellitus showed increased incidence of cortical cataract. Wespeculate that the mechanisms attributed to cataractogensis indiabetes could be similar even for CCA formation.</p><p>The sample size of our controls was twice the size of ourcases. This consolidates our results. To avoid false results due toimproper or biased recall of facts by subjects, we did not evaluateother known associations causing cortical cataracts, such as historyof estrogens used by women, sun exposure, smoking, which couldalso be possibly linked to the development of CCA.</p><p>Information on the associations with CCA enables the surgeonto especially examine the eye to detect CCA during preoperativeassessment. While performing cataract surgery on eyes thatwere precluded from standardized slit-lamp examination of thelens, such as eyes with small pupil and eyes allergic to dilatingdrops, anticipating the possible presence of CCA can avoid over-stressing the bag and zonules during rotation. Examination ofeye for extent of CCA would allow the surgeon to perform focalcortical cleaving hydrodissection in the specific clock hours/quadrants, to achieve adequate hydrodissection and successfulrotation thereof. Focal hydrodissection in such eyes can preventundesired consequences of a compromised zonular apparatus.When the aspiration of these adhesions is inadequate we couldactually leave behind adherent mitotically active lens epithelialcells which have the potential to proliferate and migrate acrossthe visual axis causing posterior capsule opacification.</p><p>The knowledge related to the associations of CCA could helpfurther research in understanding the nature of CCA and theremedy, if at all, to overcome CCA. It would be interesting toidentify specific associations that a patient might possess priorto cataract surgery that would identify CCA.</p><p>In conclusion, the association of CCA increased with corticalcataracts, increased age and female gender.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Presented in part as a poster at XXII Congress of the European Society of theCataract and Refractive
