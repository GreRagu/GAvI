MitoTEMPOL is a mitochondria-targeted derivative of TEMPOL designed to protect mitochondria from the oxidative damage that they accumulate, but once there is rapidly reduced to its hydroxylamine, MitoTEMPOL-H. As little is known about the antioxidant efficacy of hydroxylamines, this study has assessed the antioxidant activity of both MitoTEMPOL and MitoTEMPOL-H. The hydroxylamine was more effective at preventing lipid-peroxidation than MitoTEMPOL and decreased oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA caused by menadione. In contrast to MitoTEMPOL, MitoTEMPOL-H has no superoxide dismutase activity and its antioxidant actions are likely to be mediated by hydrogen atom donation. Therefore, even though MitoTEMPOL is rapidly reduced to MitoTEMPOL-H in cells, it remains an effective antioxidant. Furthermore, as TEMPOL is also reduced to a hydroxylamine <italic>in vivo</italic>, many of its antioxidant effects may also be mediated by its hydroxylamine.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MitoTEMPOL</kwd><kwd>nitroxide</kwd><kwd>hydroxylamine</kwd><kwd>lipid peroxidation</kwd><kwd>mtDNA</kwd><kwd>antioxidant</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Piperidine nitroxides such as TEMPOL (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy radical; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) exhibit potent antioxidant effects in a variety of systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. These properties have been ascribed to the ability of these nitroxides to catalyse the dismutation of superoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>], to detoxify redox-reactive forms of transition metal ions (ferrous, cuprous, ferryl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>] and to react directly with many radicals, forming adducts with varying stabilities and breakdown chemistries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>].</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Structures of TEMPOL and MitoTEMPOL.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gfrr43-4-f1"/></fig><p>As mitochondria produce significant amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage to mitochondria contributes to a number of pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>], we synthesized a mitochondria targeted TEMPOL derivative called MitoTEMPOL (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-[5-(triphenylphosphonio) pentoxy]piper-idin-1-oxy bromide) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). MitoTEMPOL comprises the piperidine nitroxide TEMPOL unit conjugated with a triphenylphosphonium (TPP) moiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. As expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>], the lipophilic TPP cation moiety enabled MitoTEMPOL to rapidly traverse biological membranes, accumulate several-hundred-fold in energized mitochondria and increased its affinity for adsorption to phospholipid bilayers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. The intention was that this selective targeting of TEMPOL to mitochondria would render MitoTEMPOL a more effective antioxidant, as has been done by targeting other antioxidants to mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]. Intriguingly, we found that MitoTEMPOL was rapidly and completely reduced to its hydroxylamine MitoTEMPOL-H within respiring mitochondria by ubiquinol in the inner membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. Reduction of cyclic nitroxides in biological systems had been known for several decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>], but the extent, site of reduction and the identity of the reductant had remained conjectural. For MitoTEMPOL this reduction is so extensive that the nitroxide cannot be detected in respiring mitochondria, suggesting that any antioxidant activity of MitoTEMPOL within mitochondria would be due to its hydroxyla-mine, MitoTEMPOL-H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. Hydroxylamines, including those derived from piperidine nitroxides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>] as well as <italic>tert</italic>-butylhydroxylamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>], have antioxidant properties, however, the mechanism of these effects has not been studied in detail. Therefore here we have determined the anti-oxidant activity of MitoTEMPOL and MitoTEMPOL-H in order to assess whether targeting MitoTEMPOL to mitochondria remains a viable antioxidant strategy. We found that MitoTEMPOL-H was effective at preventing lipid peroxidation and at preventing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, while the antioxidant activity of MitoTEMPOL was similar to that of TEMPOL. Therefore, targeting nitroxides to mitochondria is a valid antioxidant strategy, as the hydroxylamine is a potent antioxidant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>MitoTEMPOL and MitoQ were prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>].

Both TEMPOL and MitoTEMPOL prevented lipid peroxidation, but MitoTEMPOL is significantly more effective, probably due to its higher affinity to phospholipids bilayers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. Consistent with the findings from the C<sub>11</sub>-BODIPY assay, MitoTEMPOL-H is also a more effective antioxidant against lipid peroxidation than MitoTEMPOL in this system. Finally, we assessed the ability of MitoTEMPOL to prevent lipid peroxidation in intact, energized mitochondria exposed to ferrous iron to induce lipid peroxidation, measured by the TBARS assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). MitoTEMPOL (1 &#x003bc;M) significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, while the TPP control compound was ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). As MitoTEMPOL is very rapidly and completely converted to MitoTEMPOLH within energized mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>], this protection is ascribed to MitoTEMPOL-H and demonstrates that MitoTEMPOL-H is an effective antioxidant within mitochondria.</p></sec><sec><title>Antioxidant mechanism of MitoTEMPOL-H</title><p>The most likely mechanism by which MitoTEMPOL-H could act as an antioxidant is through the chain-breaking donation of a hydrogen atom to a lipid-derived or other radical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>], thereby producing the nitroxide radical (MitoTEMPOL). To see if this occurred we reacted MitoTEMPOL-H with radicals generated by AAPH. Under these conditions the concentration of the nitroxide MitoTEMPOL increased over time significantly faster than by simple auto-oxidation in the absence of AAPH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore MitoTEMPOL-H can react with radicals to produce the nitroxide MitoTEMPOL, which <italic>in vivo</italic> would be rapidly recycled to the hydroxylamine by ubiquinol within mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>].</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>The reaction of MitoTEMPOL-H with radicals produces MitoTEMPOL.

To see if this was the case, we investigated whether MitoTEMPOL protected against oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Oxidative damage was induced by using the redox cycler menadione, which is known to generate superoxide within mitochondria that can lead to lipid oxidation, as well as to a number of other types of oxidative damage such as lipid peroxidation, all of which can damage mtDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>]. A quantitative PCR (QPCR) assay was utilized to measure oxidative damage to mtDNA by comparing the relative amplification of a short and a very long segment of mtDNA. Any decrease in relative amplification of the long segment was due to DNA damage and therefore an indication of general oxidative damage to the mtDNA. A further advantage of this procedure is that there is no need to isolate mitochondria or to separate mtDNA from nuclear DNA, thereby avoiding artefacts caused by differential recovery of mitochondria or mtDNA following damage.</p><p>The relative amplification of mtDNA decreased in cells that were oxidatively stressed by menadione due to mtDNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The presence of MitoTEMPOL decreases this damage to mtDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The same concentration of the untargeted nitroxide TEMPOL is significantly less effective than MitoTEMPOL at preventing mtDNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The TPP compound propylTPP, which lacks the nitroxide moiety, exhibits no protective effect, indicating that the protection is not due to the non-specific uptake of TPP compounds into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results indicate that MitoTEMPOL can selectively protect mitochondria in cells from oxidative damage and this effect requires both the nitroxide moiety and the targeting into mitochondria.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>MitoTEMPOL protects mitochondrial DNA from damage by menadione.

Previously we have shown that MitoTEMPOL is very rapidly converted to the hydroxylamine MitoTEMPOL-H by ubiquinol in mitochondria and cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be any MitoTEMPOL present in a biological situation and that the dominant compound will be MitoTEMPOL-H. The antioxidant efficacy of MitoTEMPOL-H was quite different from that of MitoTEMPOL, as it had no SOD-mimetic activity nor could it oxidize ferrous iron. However, MitoTEMPOL-H was a very effective chain-breaking antioxidant, preventing lipid peroxidation. This reaction was shown to occur by the transfer of a hydrogen atom from MitoTEMPOL-H to quench a radical. While this reaction generates MitoTEMPOL, in mitochondria this nitroxide would be rapidly converted back to MitoTEMPOL-H. Therefore, a plausible mode for the antioxidant activity of MitoTEMPOL in mitochondria and cells is that it is rapidly converted to MitoTEMPOL-H within mitochondria and acts as a chain breaking antioxidant against free radicals by donating a hydrogen atom. In doing so, it is converted to the nitroxide MitoTEMPOL, which is then rapidly recycled back to MitoTEMPOL-H by mitochondrial ubiquinol. Thus, MitoTEMPOL may be an effective antioxidant as it is capable of being rapidly recycled within mitochondria by the respiratory chain, in a similar manner to MitoQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>].</p><p>Consequently, even though MitoTEMPOL is rapidly converted to MitoTEMPOL-H this should still lead to effective antioxidant protection against mitochondrial damage. This is because MitoTEMPOL-H is a good antioxidant, it is accumulated by mitochondria, will be rapidly recycled by ubiquinol in mitochondria and has a strong affinity for the surface of phospholipid bilayers, where most oxidative damage occurs within mitochondria. This was confirmed within cells, where MitoTEMPOL was shown to be protective against mitochondrial oxidative damage to mtDNA caused by the redox cycler menadione. Therefore, targeting a piperidine nitroxide to mitochondria is an effective antioxidant strategy, even if the nitroxide is rapidly converted to its hydroxyla-mine, and our results suggest that the efficacy of mitochondria-targeted TEMPOL should be assessed in a range of other systems, where mitochondria-targeted antioxidants such as MitoQ have been shown to be effective. In addition, these findings suggest that some of the antioxidant efficacy of TEMPOL <italic>in vivo</italic> may be due to its hydroxyalmine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Medical Research Council, the Gates Cambridge Trust and the Research Committee of the University of Otago.</p><p><bold><italic>Declaration of interest:</italic></bold> The authors report no conflicts of interest.
