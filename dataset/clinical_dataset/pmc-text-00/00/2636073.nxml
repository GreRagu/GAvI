It involves vector mathematics with algebra andtrigonometry.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> For every ophthalmologist, it is not possible togo back to 12 (10 + 2) standard mathematical knowledge andcalculate SIA. Even if one were to calculate it correctly, it takesa lot of time and effort for a number of patients. Despite thisdifficulty, calculating SIA allows the surgeon to have an accuratepicture of how his surgery is affecting the corneal curvature andhelps improve his surgery.</p><p>Computers can be programmed to do all this tediousmathematical calculations for us and that is why this software<italic>&#x02032;SIA-Soft&#x02032;</italic> has been developed. The basic mathematics behindthis software is the &#x02032;gold standard&#x02032; vector analysis of SIA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Wehave validated the accuracy and operating feasibility of thisWindows-based software for calculating SIA for a number ofpatients in comparison with gold standard mathematical vectoranalysis done manually.</p><p>The preoperative and postoperative keratometric data(<italic>K</italic>-values) with the axes of 30 different patients were takenrandomly from our cataract clinic either from manual smallincision cataract surgery (MSICS) or phacoemulsificationcategory. These 30 sets of data were given to two co-authorsfor calculation of SIA and the angles of error in a masked way.The first co-author (<italic>a student of Class XII</italic>) was asked to calculatethe SIA on the basis of pure mathematics and submit the datafor single and multiple patients and he was also asked to givethe mean and standard deviation (SD). Similarly, the secondco-author was asked to calculate SIA using the software withthe same set of data. Both of them were asked to submit thefinal data to a third observer for final analysis.</p><p>The overall results by two different observers are given in<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Average time taken for each calculation for the firstobserver by mathematical method was 5.27 &#x000b1; 0.48 min and forthe second observer by using SIA-Soft software was 6.15 &#x000b1; 0.50sec (*<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Up to six-decimal level, there was no difference inSIA and &#x02032;angle of error&#x02032; values for individual patients or meanof all patients by the two different methods.</p><p>Each astigmatism value was considered as a vector quantity,having a magnitude as well as direction. Among all methodsof calculating SIA, vector analysis is the most powerful andaccurate method.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> Though mathematically tedious, analysisof SIA allows the surgeon to evaluate his own technique andalso to maximize his potential for obtaining a consistently goodsurgical outcome. It further allows the surgeon to choose theright axis, right length, right site and right nature of incision overa period of time. This is especially important while planning forcorrection of preexisting corneal astigmatism during any typeof cataract surgery whether MSICS or phacoemulsification.This software can handle single as well as unlimited numberof patients and surgeons with simultaneous calculation ofmean and SD.</p><p><italic>SIA-Soft</italic> is a simple, accurate, off-the-shelf user-friendlystatistical software which only requires clicking of thebuttons.</p></body><back><ack><p>Official website of the All India Ophthalmological Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aios.org/">http://www.aios.org/</ext-link>) for uploading the software and making it available free (FreeDownloadable Version) to all ophthalmologists.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Carvy</surname><given-names>TV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Calculation of the change in corneal astigmatism following cataract surgery</article-title><source>Ophthalmic Surg</source><year>1979</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>38</fpage><lpage>49</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jaffe</surname><given-names>NS</given-names></name><name><surname>Jaffe</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Jaffe</surname><given-names>GF</given-names></name></person-group><source>Cataract surgery and its complication</source><year>1997</year><edition>6th ed Chap 6.</edition><publisher-loc>St Louis</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Mosby</publisher-name><fpage>134</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back><floats-group><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Overall results by two different observers</p></caption><alt-text>Table 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="IndianJOphthalmol-56-170-g001"/></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
