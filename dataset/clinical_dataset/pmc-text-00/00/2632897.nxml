Here, we report a new method, DNA assembler, which allows the assembly of an entire biochemical pathway in a single step via <italic>in vivo</italic> homologous recombination in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We show that DNA assembler can rapidly assemble a functional <sc>d</sc>-xylose utilization pathway (&#x0223c;9 kb DNA consisting of three genes), a functional zeaxanthin biosynthesis pathway (&#x0223c;11 kb DNA consisting of five genes) and a functional combined <sc>d</sc>-xylose utilization and zeaxanthin biosynthesis pathway (&#x0223c;19 kb consisting of eight genes) with high efficiencies (70&#x02013;100%) either on a plasmid or on a yeast chromosome. As this new method only requires simple DNA preparation and one-step yeast transformation, it represents a powerful tool in the construction of biochemical pathways for synthetic biology, metabolic engineering and functional genomics studies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Methods that enable design and rapid construction of biochemical pathways will be invaluable in pathway engineering, metabolic engineering, combinatorial biology and synthetic biology. In pathway and metabolic engineering, complete biosynthetic pathways are often transferred from native hosts into heterologous organisms in order to obtain products of interest at high yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>). Consequently, gene expression needs to be balanced, promoter strength needs to be tuned and the endogenous regulatory network needs to be modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>). In combinatorial biology, genes are rearranged in order to generate new small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>); whereas, in synthetic biology, complex combinations of genetic elements are used to create new circuits with desired properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In all these studies, the conventional multi-step, sequential-cloning method, including primer design, PCR amplification, restriction digestion, <italic>in vitro</italic> ligation and transformation, is typically involved and multiple plasmids are often required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). This method is not only time consuming and inefficient but also relies on unique restriction sites that become limited for large recombinant DNA molecules.</p><p>To address these limitations, a new cloning method, sequence and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC), was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Using SLIC, up to 10 DNA fragments including nine PCR-generated fragments of sizes ranging between 274 and 980 bp and a 3.1-kb vector were assembled into a recombinant DNA molecule using <italic>in vitro</italic> homologous recombination. However, the success rate was only 17% (7 of 42 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> transformants were proven to be correct), and the size of the recombinant DNA was only approximately 8 kb. More recently, a protocol called the &#x02018;domino method&#x02019; was developed to construct a number of DNA pieces, known as &#x02018;domino clones&#x02019;, in a vector through <italic>in vivo</italic> homologous recombination in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Using two selection markers alternatively, a 16.3-kb mouse mitochondrial genome and a 134.5-kb rice chloroplast genome were successfully assembled. However, each &#x02018;domino clone&#x02019; needs to be prepared in the vector first, and the whole assembly process is carried out in a sequential manner, thus requiring a great amount of time and labor.</p><p>Here, we developed a new method, called &#x02018;DNA assembler&#x02019;, that enables design and rapid construction of large biochemical pathways in one-step fashion by exploitation of <italic>in vivo</italic> homologous recombination mechanism in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Thanks to its high efficiency and ease to work with, <italic>in vivo</italic> homologous recombination in yeast has been widely used for gene cloning, plasmid construction and library creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20">13&#x02013;20</xref>). For example, Oldenburg and coworkers incorporated a linker of 30&#x02013;40 bp, homologous to a linearized yeast plasmid, into primers to PCR-amplify the target DNA. Co-transformation of the PCR products and the plasmid into yeast resulted in homologous recombination at a position directed by the PCR primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Raymond and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) used synthetic, double-stranded &#x02018;recombination linkers&#x02019; to subclone a DNA fragment, and counter-selection was later used to improve the efficiency of plasmid construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Manivasakam <italic>et al.</italic> and Langle-Rouault <italic>et al.</italic> further extended homologous recombination into genome modification and determined the length of sequence homology required for targeted gene integration and deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In addition, Larionov and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25 B26 B27">23&#x02013;27</xref>) developed a transformation-associated recombination cloning method in yeast, which was used to isolate large chromosomal fragments or entire gene clusters from complex genomes and to assemble synthetic DNA arrays of long tandem repeats up to 120 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Most recently, Gibson and coworkers described the construction of the entire <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium</italic> genome from 101 fragments. The assembly process was partitioned to several rounds and <italic>in vitro</italic> recombination followed by transformation into <italic>E. coli</italic> was used to assemble the synthetic cassettes. In the final step, the complete synthetic genome was assembled by transformation-associated recombination cloning in yeast when the size of the synthetic molecule became too big to be stable in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Despite these impressive applications, yeast <italic>in vivo</italic> homologous recombination has not been used to assemble multiple-gene biochemical pathways in a one-step fashion either on a plasmid or on a chromosome.</p><p>As proof of concept, we used DNA assembler to rapidly assemble three distinct functional biochemical pathways with sizes ranging from 9 to 19 kb on both a plasmid and a chromosome. This method is highly efficient and circumvents the potential problems associated with the conventional cloning method, representing a versatile approach for the construction of biochemical pathways for synthetic biology, metabolic engineering and functional genomics studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Microorganisms, plasmids, reagents and media</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> YSG50 (<italic>MAT&#x003b1;</italic>, <italic>ade</italic>2-1, <italic>ade</italic>3&#x00394;22, <italic>ura</italic>3-1, <italic>his</italic>3-11,15, <italic>trp</italic>1-1, <italic>leu</italic>2-3,112 and <italic>can</italic>1-100) was used as the host for DNA assembly and integration.

The 5&#x02032;-end of the first gene expression cassette is designed to overlap with a vector (or a helper fragment carrying a selection marker and a sequence sharing homology with a targeted locus of a chromosome for integration), while the 3&#x02032;-end is designed to overlap with the second cassette.

Homologous recombination is much more efficient in yeast than in bacteria and other higher eukaryotes. Therefore, it has been exploited as one of the most important tools in gene cloning, site-specific mutagenesis, plasmid construction and target gene disruption and deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21 B22">18&#x02013;22</xref>). In this report, we further extended its application to assemble biochemical pathways in a single step.</p><p>The novelty of this DNA assembler method lies on the following aspects: (a) it is the first demonstration of yeast <italic>in vivo</italic> homologous recombination in assembling multiple-gene biochemical pathways in a single step, which distinguishes it from routine single-gene plasmid construction; (b) compared to the two related methods including the SLIC method and the domino method, DNA assembler is the most rapid and efficient approach to construct large recombinant DNA molecules; (c) unlike the SLIC method and the domino method, DNA assembler can be used to construct custom-designed DNA molecules not only on a plasmid but also on a chromosome. The latter enables the exogenous DNA stably maintained in the cell and has the potential to assemble a very large biochemical pathway or even a whole genome.</p><p>Similar to <italic>E. coli</italic>, because of its well-characterized physiology and genetics and ample genetic tools, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has been widely used as a platform organism for heterologous expression of biochemical pathways in the fields of pathway engineering and metabolic engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>). In contrast to the conventional techniques for pathway cloning, DNA assembler avoids repeated cycles of multiple-step cloning, does not rely on the restriction digestion and <italic>in vitro</italic> ligation and takes only 1&#x02013;2 weeks to assemble multiple DNA fragments into <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> either on a plasmid or on a chromosome. It simply takes the advantage of the pre-existing homologous recombination machinery in yeast and thus does not require any exogenous recombinase.</p><p>In addition, unlike the recently reported <italic>in vitro</italic> SLIC recombination method that requires T4 DNA polymerase and RecA recombinase to treat the DNA substrates before transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), DNA assembler only requires simple DNA preparation via PCR and one-step yeast transformation and yet yields a much higher assembly efficiency than the SLIC method. As shown in our report, for a shorter pathway (3&#x02013;5 genes, &#x0223c;10 kb), a very high efficiency of 80&#x02013;100% was obtained with a &#x0223c;50-bp overlap, while for a longer pathway (8 genes, &#x0223c;19 kb), a relatively high efficiency of 40&#x02013;70% was achieved with a slightly longer overlap (&#x0223c;125&#x02013;430 bp). In addition, for a long pathway, increasing the ratio between the inserts and the backbone could further improve the assembly efficiency. For example, the eight-gene pathway was reassembled with a &#x0223c;50-bp overlap. The amount of the inserts was doubled while the amount of the linearized vector was maintained (i.e. 600 ng of each insert was combined with 500 ng of the linearized vector). As a result, more colonies on the SC-Ura plates were observed, and an assembly efficiency of as high as 70% was obtained, compared with the efficiency of 20% when lower amount of the inserts was used. This indicates that DNA assembler could efficiently assemble a large DNA molecule even with a short overlap by manipulating the ratio between the inserts and the vector backbone.</p><p>It is possible that deletions may be caused by a repeat or repeats in the DNA fragments. To address this concern, we examined the existence of repeats in pRS426m-xylose-zeaxanthin. We found that short repeats are very common in such a 24.6-kb DNA molecule. As shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn991/DC1">Supplementary Table 3</ext-link>, 7 sequences with a length of 14 bp appeared twice, which were widely distributed among promoters, terminators and structural genes. In addition, 29 sequences (13 bp), 76 sequences (12 bp), 197 sequences (11 bp) and 527 sequences (10 bp) were found to occur at least twice in the same molecule. These abundant repeats up to 14 bp did not appear to be problematic in our experiment considering that assembling efficiencies of 40&#x02013;70%, 50&#x02013;60% and 10&#x02013;20% were obtained with 270&#x02013;430-bp, &#x0223c;125-bp and &#x0223c;50-bp overlaps, respectively. Previous homologous recombination-based gene-cloning experiments by other groups indicated the length of overlap required for efficient recombination between two DNA fragments: 40-bp overlaps yielded an efficiency of greater than 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). The efficiency was slightly reduced using 30-bp overlaps (&#x0223c;80%) and rapidly dropped to 3.4% when 20-bp overlaps were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Similarly, in terms of deletions, Manivasakam and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) studied the length of a repeat required for targeted deletion. A repeat of a 45 bp, a 30 bp and a 25 bp resulted in efficiencies of 84%, 54% and 4%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In addition, Langle-Rouault and Jacobs reported that selection of marker excision failed using 25-bp direct repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). All these studies suggest that the efficiency of recombination-based deletions is fairly low when repeats of shorter than 25 bp are involved. It should also be noted that in all these mentioned experiments, a selectable marker was used to specifically select the deletion event, and the efficiency was calculated based on the percentage of the correct deletions among all the transformants. Therefore, short repeats (&#x0003c;25 bp) in a long DNA molecule should not cause too much trouble, especially because such a deletion event is not specifically selected, making the chance even much lower. When the repeats become longer (&#x0003e;25 bp, but not too long), the recombination between the repeats will likely compete with the recombination between the overlaps at the ends of each fragment in the assembling process. In this case, a longer overlap (&#x0003e;100 bp) will benefit the recombination between the ends. The deletion between repeats could happen, but the chance will be several orders of magnitude lower than the above efficiency considering that no selection is used in such a deletion process. Of special note, we recently developed an efficient method for gene deletions in yeast, and we studied the length of the repeats required to yield decent deletion efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Our results showed that 25-bp repeats are not sufficient to generate deletions. It should be noted that when the repeats become very long (&#x0003e;100 bp), the deletion event may occur with a higher efficiency. However, such long repeats are not common in a typical biochemical pathway. If long repeats exist in structural genes, silent mutations may be incorporated during the fragment preparation process in order to reduce the length of the repeated regions.</p><p>In our studies, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> YSG50 was used as a host for DNA assembly and integration. This strain carries a <italic>ura</italic>3-1 point mutation on its genome, which may be converted to wild type by the <italic>ura3</italic> gene in the pRS626m vector (or in the helper fragment). To address this concern, we also tested a strain HZ848 with a complete deletion of <italic>ura3</italic> (the strain HZ848 was obtained by deleting the <italic>ura3</italic> gene in YSG50). The same amount of DNA mixture (eight DNA fragments plus the digested vector) was transformed to YSG50 and HZ848, and in parallel, the same amount of the linearized vector was transformed to both strains as controls.</p><p>Similar numbers of colonies were obtained in the two samples (42 for YSG50 versus 38 for HZ848), whereas only two colonies appeared in both controls. That the same number of colonies appeared in both controls suggested that the vector had not been completely digested. Although it is possible that the chromosomal gene <italic>ura</italic>3-1 may be converted to wild type, it should occur at a very low frequency (&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>). In comparison, the frequency of DNA assembly was estimated to be 5.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> (&#x0223c;40 colonies appearing on the Sc-Ura plates from 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells), which is relatively high. Ten clones from both of YSG50 transformants and HZ88 transformants were selected for further analysis. Of 10, 5 YSG50 transformants and 4 of 10 HZ848 transformants were correct, indicating that for a biochemical pathway consisting of up to eight genes, there is no advantage to use a strain with a complete deletion of <italic>ura</italic>3. However, when the assembly efficiency drops to a similar level with that of the reversion rate of <italic>ura</italic>3-1 back to wild type, using a strain with <italic>ura</italic>3 completely deleted might become advantageous. Such scenario may occur when a much longer biochemical pathway is assembled.</p><p>It should be noted that DNA assembler has the potential to assemble much longer biochemical pathways in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Conceptually, a long biochemical pathway can be split into several segments (8&#x02013;10 genes each) that will be sequentially integrated into the yeast chromosome by using a recyclable selection marker such as Ura. Once a segment is integrated, 5-fluoroorotic acid can be used to remove the integrated Ura selection marker from the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), so that another segment can be integrated subsequently. Through recycling the selection marker, horizontally moving any biochemical pathways from their native hosts to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> will be no longer limited by the size of the pathways. For example, a biochemical pathway composed of 30&#x02013;50 genes (around 100&#x02013;200 kb) could be integrated to the chromosome of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> within several weeks. Of course, when a biochemical pathway is very long, PCR-introduced mutations may become a concern even though high-fidelity DNA polymerases are used. Note that this concern is also common to other reported DNA assembly methods using high-fidelity polymerases such as the Phusion polymerase (with a very low error rate, 4.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>) should greatly reduce the mutation frequency. Fortunately, with the development of new powerful DNA sequencing technologies, validation of the correctly assembled long biochemical pathway by DNA sequencing is no longer a burden in terms of time and cost. For example, the recently developed 454 sequencing technology (Roche, Branford, CT) supports the sequencing of samples from a wide variety of starting materials including genomic DNA, PCR products, BACs and cDNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.454.com/">http://www.454.com/</ext-link>). And it costs less than $15K to sequence the entire genome of a microorganism of typical size (&#x0223c;6 Mb) within a few days.</p><p>In principle, this method may be even used to assemble a DNA molecule as large as an entire chromosome or genome. As a matter of fact, Gibson and coworkers&#x02019; success in the construction of the entire <italic>M. genitalium</italic> genome from 101 fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) indicates that it is possible to assemble a DNA molecule as large as a genome from short DNA fragments using DNA assembler. Also, in addition to assembling biochemical pathways and genomes, DNA assembler has many other applications such as library creation in combinatorial biology and construction of complicated DNA molecules in the field of synthetic biology.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn991/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> (<award-id>GM077596</award-id>).
