The explanation for this glaring health disparity is still unknown; although a number of different plausible factors have been offered including genetic susceptibility and gene-environment interactions. We favor the hypothesis that altered gene expression plays a major role in the disparity observed in prostate cancer incidence and mortality between African American and Caucasian American Males. To discover genes or gene expression pattern(s) unique to African American or to Caucasian American Males that explain the observed prostate cancer health disparity in African American males, we conducted a micro array pilot project study that used prostate tumors with a Gleason score of 6. We compared gene expression profiling in tumors from African-American Males to prostate tumors in Caucasian American Males. A comparison of case-matched ratios revealed at least 67 statistically significant genes that met filtering criteria of at least +/- 4.0 fold change and p &#x0003c; 0.0001. Gene ontology terms prevalent in African American prostate tumor/normal ratios relative to Caucasian American prostate tumor/normal ratios included interleukins, progesterone signaling, Chromatin-mediated maintenance and myeloid dendritic cell proliferation. Functional in vitro assays are underway to determine roles that selected genes in these onotologies play in contributing to prostate cancer development and health disparity.</p></abstract><conference><conf-date>12&#x02013;13 May 2008</conf-date><conf-name>Second Annual International African-Caribbean Cancer Consortium Conference</conf-name><conf-loc>Miami, FL, USA</conf-loc></conference></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>African American males (AAM) have a 1.6 increased risk of developing prostate cancer (PCa), and a 2.5 fold increased mortality rate relative to Caucasian American males (CAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] The explanation for this greater PCa burden in African Americans, still unclear, is probably multi-factorial and may include diet, access to care, racial differences in PCa treatment, socioeconomic status, attitudes about care and or differences in gene expression or gene-environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].

Authorization for tumor tissue used in this study was obtained through IRB approved protocols from Florida A&#x00026;M University and from the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center. Selection of prostate tissue from the Moffitt Cancer Center Tissue Bank was made based on race/ethnicity, availability of tumors with same Gleason grade/score. Due to the limited tissue availability, this pilot project used a total of 16 prostate tissue samples. We used four snap frozen PCa tumors and four matched controls from CAM men and four snap frozen PCa tumors and four matched controls from AAM. All PCa tumors in this study had a Gleason score of 3+3 = 6. The 3+3 designation refers to the histological pattern or grade of the prostate cells. For example, if 95% or more of the tumor is composed of one pattern, the corresponding number is counted twice, thus an entire moderately differentiated tumor would be scored as 3+3 = 6. A Gleason score of 2&#x02013;4 is low grade, 5&#x02013;7 is intermediate grade and 8&#x02013;10 is high grade.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation, probe preparation, hybridization and scans</title><p>Total RNA from excised tissue specimens was isolated using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the manufacturer's protocol.

Caucasian American Males that explain the observed PCa health disparity between the two races. The novel findings of this study resulted in the identification of at least four candidate genes that warrant further investigation as to their role in PCa health disparity. First we observed that <italic>TCEAL 7 </italic>expression in PCa tumor and in non-tumor tissue was higher in CAM compared to AAM. The TCEAL7 gene modulates transcription in a promoter context-dependent manner. Moreover, a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] has implicated TCEAL 7 as a cell death regulatory protein frequently inactivated by methylation in ovarian cancer. These authors showed that when re-expressed in cancer cell lines, TCEAL 7 induces cell death and reduces colony formation; thus suggesting that TCEAL 7 functions as a tumor suppressor protein. Because TCEAL 7 expression is slightly higher in CAM than in AAM it is interesting to speculate that increased expression of TCEAL 7 in CAM may correlate with increased suppression of prostate tumors in CAM but decreased prostate tumor suppression in AAM.</p><p>The second set of novel findings in this study was the identification of gene ontology (GO) terms and pathways that are prevalent in the 67 down-regulated genes (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The GO terms most prevalent in AAM were interleukins, progesterone signaling and chromatin-mediated maintenance. Genes associated with these GO ontologies, which were decreased in expression in AAM compared to CAM, were Histone Deacetylase 11 or HDAC 11 (down regulated by 4.4876 fold); Interferon regulatory factor 4 (down regulated by 4.2142 fold), and the progesterone receptor (down regulated by 2.7830 fold). HDAC is an emerging oncology target. HDAC regulates gene expression and overexpressed or sustained HDAC activity, occurring in some cancer cells, results in deacetylation of the histone tails or histone hypoacetylation. Histone hypoacetylation results in more closed or tightly packaged chromatin structure in which certain genes may become inaccessible to transcription factors and hence will not get transcribed. Such events are being studied aggressively as a plausible mechanism for limiting or silencing tumor suppressor genes. We have yet to discover the significance of HDAC 11 down regulation in AAM samples compared to CAM samples in this pilot project study. The finding that the progesterone receptor is down regulated in AAM relative to CAM samples is very intriguing in light of the fact that decreased progesterone receptor expression contributes to poor prognosis for breast cancer in African American women. That this pilot project data underscores the prevalence of interleukins is noteworthy because a report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] on tumor immunological differences between African Americans and European American Males was published as this data was being summarized. Taken together, this study revealed 67 genes that are differentially expressed in AAM prostate tumors, compared to CAM. Functional assay studies are underway to investigate the role at least four of these genes and the role that they play in prostate cancer development and health disparity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Supported by the Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program W81XXWH-04-1-0326 and American Society of Cell Biology Minority Fellows Support to Dr. R.
