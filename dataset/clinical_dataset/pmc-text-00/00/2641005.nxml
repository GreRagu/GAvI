Despite intensive clinical investigation and many novel therapeutic approaches, average survival for the patients with malignant gliomas is only about 1 year. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has shown potent and cancer-selective killing activity and drawn considerable attention as a promising therapy for cancers, but concerns over delivery and toxicity have limited progress. We have developed a secretable trimeric TRAIL (stTRAIL) and here evaluated the therapeutic potential of this stTRAIL-based gene therapy in brain tumors. An adenovirus (Ad-stTRAIL) delivering stTRAIL was injected into intra-cranial human glioma tumors established in nude mice and tumor growth monitored using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ad-stTRAIL gene therapy showed potent tumor suppressor activity with no toxic side effects at therapeutically effective doses. When compared with 1, 3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), a conventional therapy for malignant gliomas, Ad-stTRAIL suppressed tumor growth more potently. The combination of Ad-stTRAIL and BCNU significantly increased survival compared to the control mice or mice receiving Ad-stTRAIL alone. Our data indicate that Ad-stTRAIL, either alone or combined with BCNU, has promise as a novel therapy for malignant gliomas.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the TNF family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Wiley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Pitti1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. TRAIL is primarily expressed as a type II transmembrane protein in which the carboxyl terminus of the receptor-binding domain protrudes extracellularly.

Once activated, DR4 and/or DR5 transmit apoptotic signals intracellularly. Similar to other TNF family members such as FasL and TNF-a, TRAIL activates caspase-8 as an initial apoptotic signaling event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Sprick1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Kischkel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite similarity in apoptotic signaling cascades activated but the mechanism largely unknown yet, TRAIL has a unique selectivity for triggering apoptosis in tumor cells but not most normal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Ashkenazi1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Walczak2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, complying with the tissue distribution of the TRAIL receptors, TRAIL has a wide range of targets.

However, treatment of malignant gliomas with conventional approaches is largely unsuccessful because a wide resection commonly applied for other malignancies is limited and curative doses of therapeutics generally cannot be delivered to the tumor site without excessive toxicity to normal tissues. As a consequence, the mortality rate for the patients harboring malignant gliomas remains high for the past decades. Here, we present a novel TRAIL-based gene therapy for malignant gliomas. Our gene therapy approach showed potent tumor suppressor activity for intracranial brain tumor with no toxic side effects. Our data indicate that this approach has great promise as a therapy toward malignant gliomas.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>TRAIL is a membrane-bound ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Wiley1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Pitti1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> which acts through its cognate death receptors DR4 and/or DR5 on the surface of target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Pan1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-MacFarlane1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Kim1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. It is thus expected that secreted soluble TRAIL should kill a larger number of cells through wider distribution. To develop a biologically active form of soluble TRAIL produced in mammalian cells, we manipulated the apoptosis-inducing moiety of TRAIL (amino acids 114&#x02013;281) to be secreted through fusion with a secretion signal sequence. Interestingly, however, we observed that unlike recombinant soluble TRAIL (114&#x02013;281) produced from bacterial cells, the secreted TRAIL (114&#x02013;281) produced in mammalian cells maintains its apoptotic functionality only when it is fused with a trimerization-enforcing domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Kim2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. This result suggested that the soluble TRAIL (114&#x02013;281) ectopically expressed in mammalian cells does not form the trimer quaternary structure required for apoptotic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Cha1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Hymowitz1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004545-Hymowitz2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these observations, we have created an expression cassette that encodes a secretable form of trimeric TRAIL (stTRAIL) composed of the three functional elements including a secretion signal, a trimerization domain and an apoptosis-inducing moiety of TRAIL gene sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004545-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

We compared apoptotic activity of Ad-stTRAIL with that of an adenoviral vector (Ad-flTRAIL) carrying membrane-bound full-length TRAIL (flTRAIL) in a trans-well system that allows only soluble and diffusible agents to reach target cells. Ad-flTRAIL showed no observable cell death, whereas Ad-stTRAIL effectively induced death in the U87-MG target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004545-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Ad-stTRAIL also induced higher apoptotic activity than Ad-flTRAIL (data not shown).

In tests using various glioma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004545-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), Ad-stTRAIL induced cell death in all except U373-MG and ACBRI371, both of which also showed significant resistance to recombinant TRAIL protein. Despite their resistance to TRAIL (recombinant TRAIL protein or Ad-stTRAIL), U373-MG and ACBRI371 cells expressed TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 (data not shown). Moreover, all the cell lines also well expressed CAR, an adenovirus receptor molecule. Thus, resistance of U373-MG and ACBRI371 to Ad-stTRAIL seems unlikely to be associated with efficiency of adenovirus infection. Currently, resistance of U373-MG cells to TRAIL is under investigation.</p><fig id="pone-0004545-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004545.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>In vitro and in vivo Tumoricidal Activity Assessment of Ad-stTRAIL.</title><p>(A) Glioma cells, plated in 24-wells, were treated with rhTRAIL (0&#x0223c;100 ng/ml) or Ad-stTRAIL (1&#x0223c;100 MOI) and incubated for 48 h, followed by cell viability analysis as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>.

It is important to know if the intra-cranially delivered viral particles cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the blood circulation resulting in possible systemic exposure. To address this question, we analyzed viral DNA in blood plasma and multiple organs at different time points following delivery of Ad-stTRAIL (1&#x000d7;10<sup>10</sup> viral particles) to rat brain. Detectable DNA peaked in the blood at 30 min and then rapidly disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004545-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Similarly, viral DNA was detectable in organs during only early time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004545-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Although viral DNA was detected in the blood circulation and organs, it is important to point that the amount of viral DNA measured outside of the brain, even at the peak, was just 0.0008&#x00025; of the total input. Minimal stTRAIL protein was detected in the blood plasma and liver (data not shown). Thus, the quantity of viral particles and recombinant protein that transiently enters the systemic circulation after brain injection appears to be very limited. In contrast, viral DNA at the injection site persisted longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004545-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) and both DNA and protein at the injection site correlated with the dose of viral particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004545-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). In addition to the blood plasma, we also examined the viral particles in circulating blood cells including red blood cells and lymphocytes. No significant amount of viral DNA was observable in these cells (data not shown). Our data indicate that Ad-stTRAIL cannot freely cross the blood-brain barrier and remains localized mainly at the delivery site, where the expression is sustained without systemic side effects.</p><fig id="pone-0004545-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004545.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Tissue Distribution of Ad-stTRAIL in Animals.</title><p>(A, B) Ad-stTRAIL (1&#x000d7;10<sup>10</sup> viral particles) was delivered to the putamen region of rat brain and subjected to analysis at the indicated times for Ad-stTRAIL DNA copies in blood plasma (A) and in different organs (B).

We therefore evaluated the combination of Ad-stTRAIL and BCNU, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. BCNU modestly enhanced the apoptotic activity of Ad-stTRAIL in TRAIL-susceptible glioma cells including U87-MG, LN-18 and U343-MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004545-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, BCNU significantly augmented cell death induced by Ad-stTRAIL in U373-MG and ACBRI371 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004545-g008">Figure 8</xref>), two tumor cell lines shown to be almost completely resistant to Ad-stTRAIL or TRAIL protein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004545-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

Ad-stTRAIL/BCNU combination therapy also improved the survival rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004545-g009">Figure 9C</xref>).

Ad-stTRAIL vector showed better efficacy in an animal brain tumor model than BCNU. Combination therapy comprising Ad-stTRAIL and BCNU resulted in greater efficacy than Ad-stTRAIL or BCNU alone. Furthermore, Ad-stTRAIL was safe at the dose showing therapeutic efficacy. It is important to note that repeated intracranial injection of Ad-stTRAIL did not induce detectable anti-adenovirus immune responses. In fact, no neutralizing anti-adenovirus antibody was detectable in the plasma following repeated intracranial injection of Ad-stTRAIL (data not shown), suggesting that expected therapeutic efficacy can be obtained even after repeated delivery of Ad-stTRAIL. Although the mechanism for limited host immune responses to Ad-stTRAIL remains to be determined, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), separating the adenovirus-injection site from the blood circulation, seems likely to play a certain role. Taken together, our results raise the possibility that Ad-stTRAIL will be effective in other chemo-resistant tumors and serve as the basis for a clinical trail currently planned for malignant gliomas in Korea.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Recombinant human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) was obtained from R&#x00026;D systems (Minneapolis, MN).

To generate an orthotropic xenograft model for brain tumor, U87-MG human malignant glioma cells (1&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/10 &#x000b5;L per mouse brain) were stereotactically implanted into the right striatum of athymic mice using Just For Mice&#x02122; stereotaxic (Stoelting Co, IL). As an individual therapy, delivery of controls or Ad-stTRAIL to tumor sites was performed at the indicated times. BCNU (10 mg/kg) was injected intra-peritoneally followed by intra-tumoral injections of controls or Ad-stTRAIL. The changes of established tumor mass were detected by MRI. The survival profile is expressed as a Kaplan-Meier survival estimate. All the experiments done on animals were approved by an institutional review board.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>MR imaging</title><p>Mice were imaged following anesthesia with ketamin (57 mg/ml, 15 &#x000b5;l/10 g body weight, injected intra-peritoneally). MRI examinations were performed on a 1.5-T MRI system (GE Signa MR/i Hispeed Plus, GE Medical Systems, WI). The volume of tumor was calculated in T2-weighted axial, coronal and sagittal images.</p></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Safety evaluation of Ad-stTRAIL</title><p>5-week-old male and female rats purchased from Orient Co., Ltd. (Seoul, Korea) were given the control (the formulation buffer) or the modality (3&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup>, 1&#x000d7;10<sup>10</sup> or 3&#x000d7;10<sup>10</sup> viral particles) at the putamen region of brain: exactly, 3.1 mm right, 0.4 mm front, 6.0 mm deep from the bregma. The same volume (30 &#x000b5;l/head) of Ad-stTRAIL formulation buffer was used as a vehicle control. Using 6 male and 6 female rats as an each experimental group, side effects, such as body weight loss, mortality and/or other general toxic symptom/appearance, were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Detection of Ad-stTRAIL DNA in blood plasma, major organs or brain tissues</title><p>The tissues from organs or brain tissues from the virus injection site were weighed, homogenized and subjected to total DNA isolation using the QIAmp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). Blood, obtained from the tail vein or abdominal aorta, was mixed with heparin (50&#x02236;1) and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate plasma. The total DNA was isolated from the plasma using QIAmp DNA mini kit. The total tissue or blood DNAs were subjected to Taqman real time PCR (7900HT real time PCR, ABI) using the primer sets specifically amplifying the connecting junction region of between stTRAIL and the viral genome.</p></sec><sec id="s3k"><title>Detection of stTRAIL protein</title><p>The tissues from the virus injection site were lysed in a buffer (25 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 0.5&#x00025; Na-Deoxycholate, 2&#x00025; NP-40, 0.2&#x00025; SDS, 10&#x00025; (v/v) protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)). After measuring protein concentration using the Bradford assay kit (Bio0Rad), lysates were subjected to ELISA. The plates (Immuno Maxisorp) purchased from Nalge Nunc (Rochester, NY) were prepared by coating with anti-human TRAIL antibody (1.5 &#x000b5;g/ml) in a binding solution (50 &#x000b5;l/well, 0.1M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> (pH 9.0)) and blocked with a blocking solution (200 &#x000b5;l/well, 2&#x00025; BSA in PBS). The plates were then incubated with lysates or rhTRAIL as a standard. After 1 h incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, the plates were washed and treated with diluted biotinylated anti-human TRAIL antibody (100 &#x000b5;l/well, 0.2 &#x000b5;g/ml in incubation buffer) for 1 hr at room temperature. Following washing, diluted avidin-HRP (100 &#x000b5;l/well, 1/1000 dilution) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. ABTS solution (Sigma) was added for color development and measured by reading absorbance at 405 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s3l"><title>TUNEL staining and histology</title><p>Twenty one days after intracranial implantation of tumors, mice were sacrificed and cryostat sections of brain were prepared. Cryostat sections (6 &#x000b5;m) were air-dried and stained with H&#x00026;E, or subjected to TUNEL staining. TUNEL staining was carried out using the kit DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL system from Promega (Madison, WI).
