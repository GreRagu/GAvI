The antifolate drug pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine inhibits two enzymes in the parasite's folate synthesis pathway. Amino acid changes at positions 50, 51, 59, 108 and 164 in one of these enzymes, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), are strongly associated with pyrimethamine resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C2">2</xref></sup> At present, isolates harbouring four mutations (C<underline>IRNL</underline>, with mutated amino acids underlined) show the highest degree of resistance to pyrimethamine. There are several <italic>DHFR</italic> genotypes in malaria-endemic regions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C3">3</xref></sup> but the number of times the resistant genotype has emerged in independent parasite lineages is thought to be considerably limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C7">7</xref></sup> In south-east Asia, an analysis of microsatellite markers flanking <italic>DHFR</italic> indicated that all resistant parasites bearing two or more mutations share a single lineage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C4">4</xref></sup> In contrast, in Africa, multiple indigenous lineages have been reported for <italic>DHFR</italic> double mutants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C8">8</xref></sup> Nevertheless, it is currently accepted that these indigenous double mutants have not yet produced a triple mutant. Rather, nearly all lineages showing the <italic>DHFR</italic> triple mutant found in Africa have been ascribed to the migration of triple-mutant parasites from south-east Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C8">8</xref></sup> However, given the occurrence of multiple lineages of <italic>DHFR</italic> double mutants in Africa, it is likely that triple mutants may have evolved independently within the continent. In this study, we determined the <italic>DHFR</italic> genotype and flanking microsatellite haplotypes of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> isolates from the Republic of Congo, Ghana and Kenya. We discovered two previously undescribed lineages of the <italic>DHFR</italic> triple mutant, from Ghana and Kenya, showing the independent evolution of <italic>DHFR</italic> triple mutants within Africa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study site and patients</title><p>Blood samples were collected from symptomatic individuals from Pointe-Noire, Brazzaville and Gamboma in the Republic of Congo in 2006 and from asymptomatic individuals at three villages near Winneba in Ghana in 2004 and at two villages in Kisii District in Kenya in 1998. In all regions, surveys were necessarily conducted prior to the official introduction of pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine treatment for malaria and so were not feasible with current populations. These studies were approved by the administrative authority of the Ministry for Research and Ministry for Health in the Republic of Congo, the Ministry of Health/Ghana Health Service and the Ministries of Health and Education in Kenya. In all surveys, each patient was informed about the study prior to sampling, consent was obtained (in the case of children, parents/guardians gave informed consent) and medical follow-up was provided if needed.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>DHFR genotyping and microsatellite haplotyping</title><p>Parasite DNA was purified using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) for samples from Ghana and Kenya and the EZ1 BioRobot&#x02122; (QIAGEN) for samples from the Republic of Congo. The first 184 codons of <italic>DHFR</italic>, encompassing all known polymorphic loci were amplified by nested PCR. Amplified products were directly sequenced with a BigDye terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kit in an ABI 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C9">9</xref></sup> In order to determine the evolutionary history of pyrimethamine-resistant <italic>DHFR</italic> genotypes, we identified individual haplotypes based on the association of five microsatellite markers closely linked to the gene (0.1, 3.87 and 4.49 kb upstream, and 0.52 and 1.48 kb downstream of <italic>DHFR</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C4">4</xref></sup> Briefly, variation in the number of TA repeats in microsatellite loci was measured by semi-nested PCR using fluorescent end-labelled primers, followed by electrophoresis on an ABI 377 sequencer and analysed with the Genescan software (Applied Biosystems).</p><p>The microsatellite haplotype observed in south-east Asia, harbouring an association of 200-194-176-106-203 bp at microsatellite loci 4.49, 3.87 and 0.1 kb upstream and 0.52 and 1.48 kb downstream of <italic>DHFR</italic> was designated the SEA haplotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C10">10</xref></sup> Microsatellite haplotypes unique to the Republic of Congo, Ghana and Kenya are described in the Results section.

All three samples of the KEN haplotype were chimeric haplotypes, having alleles of the SEA haplotype at two loci.

One of the three lineages is identical to the SEA lineage and the other two lineages, the KEN lineage and GHA lineage, are unique to Africa. The SEA lineage was the most prevalent of the <italic>DHFR</italic> triple mutants, but the prevalence of the two African lineages was significant. Importantly, microsatellite haplotypes of the two African lineages were also found from parasites with <italic>DHFR</italic> double mutants, while no double mutants shared the SEA microsatellite haplotype. These findings present strong evidence for the indigenous evolution of the <italic>DHFR</italic> triple mutant from the double mutant in Africa.</p><p>Previous reports have not identified indigenously generated African triple <italic>DHFR</italic> mutants. These include two studies analysing 24 triple mutants from South Africa,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C6">6</xref></sup> and 204 from 11 sub- Saharan African countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C7">7</xref></sup> In these countries, all triple mutants except one showed an identical or very similar microsatellite haplotype to the SEA haplotype. This suggests that the <italic>DHFR</italic> triple mutant currently predominant in Africa was imported from SEA, rather than indigenously generated. In the present study, the SEA lineage was the most prevalent in all countries considered, but two other indigenous lineages were also observed.</p><p>The co-prevalence of the SEA haplotype and the KEN/GHA haplotypes in Africa suggests that the indigenous <italic>DHFR</italic> triple mutant may have evolved earlier than or contemporaneously with the migration of the SEA type from south-east Asia&#x02014;an initial triple mutant, either indigenously evolved or imported, would quickly spread out through the continent, as observed in south-east Asia, where only a single lineage of <italic>DHFR</italic> triple or quadruple mutant is presently prevalent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C10">10</xref></sup> This scenario is based on the assumption that pyrimethamine pressure was continuously and extensively present. However, in Africa, the history of pyrimethamine administration differs greatly country-by-country. Indeed, we observed the <italic>DHFR</italic> wild-type, a single mutant and double mutants in three African countries, a situation in sharp contrast to that in south-east Asia where all <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> populations show a single lineage of <italic>DHFR</italic> triple/quadruple mutant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C10">10</xref></sup> Dispersal of drug resistance obviously depends on many factors, including movements of infected people, the intensity of malaria transmission, the level of host population immunity and the history and extent of drug usage. Thus, the strength of any selective sweep by pyrimethamine differs depending on area, making it difficult to infer which occurred earlier; the migration of the <italic>DHFR</italic> triple mutant from south-east Asia into Africa or the indigenous evolution of the triple mutant in Africa.</p><p>This study also presents strong evidence for the indigenous evolution of <italic>DHFR</italic> double mutants in Africa. All three countries studied have a unique, country-specific lineage of a <italic>DHFR</italic> double mutant, suggesting that the generation of <italic>DHFR</italic> double mutants is not a rare event in Africa, a situation that differs from south-east Asia and Melanesia, where the generation of double mutants has been very rare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN482C10">10</xref></sup> As the prevalence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> is much greater in many parts of Africa than in most of south-east Asia and Melanesia, the pool of potential drug-resistant mutant parasites available for selection by drug pressure is much larger. We believe that this situation may explain the generation and selection of multiple independently originating drug-resistant mutants in Africa.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by <grant-sponsor>the Takeda Science Foundation, a Grant-in-aid for scientific research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>17590380, 18073013, 18GS03140013</grant-num>), and <grant-sponsor>a Grant-in-aid from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>H20-Shinkou-ippan-013</grant-num>).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Transparency declarations</title><p>None to declare.</p><p>T.
