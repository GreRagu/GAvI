However, postoperative complications are still the most important causes resulting in death of patients undergoing OLT. The incidences of posttransplant cerebrovascular complications or intracranial hemorrhage were 2.2%&#x02013;3.9% in United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], 3.3% in United Kingdom[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], 3.7% in Chile[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], 6% in Spain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], 6.5% in Hong Kong[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] clinically, and 32.7% in post-mortem patients after OLT in United States[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. But cerebrovascular complications following OLT in patients of mainland China have not been reported.

The mean in-hospital time were 39 &#x000b1; 21.7 days (8 to 70 days). All patients with cerebrovascular complications had brain CT scan. Among them, eight patients (8/337, 2.4%) experienced intracranial hemorrhage, including 5 with lobe hematomas, 2 with subdural hematomas, and 1 with lobe and subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 7 of 8 intracranial hemorrhages occurred within posttransplant 1 month. The clinical presentations, such as unconsciousness, headache, aphasia, hemiparesis, seizures, were similar to common hemorrhagic stroke, but with rapid deterioration at early stage. Five of 8 patients with intracranial hemorrhage deteriorated clinically and then died within two weeks after onset, including two patients with enlargement of hematoma and intraventricular mass, and a marked midline shift on repeated CT. Two of 337 (0.6%) patients had lacunar cerebral infarctions on the 6th and the 58th postoperative day respectively. One patient's lesions located in basal ganglia and cerebellum, the other patient with generalized seizures at the oneset had a lacunar infarction at left basal ganglia. Although the seizure stopped soon after antiepileptic therapy, the aptient became apathia and reactiveless, then persistent coma. Neurological examination showed bilateral unclear papilla opticas with left papilla optica retinal vein bleeding and stiff neck. It's a pity that the repeat CT scan was not done due to the severe conditions. The patient died of multiple organ failure on the 11th days after OLT. All clinical and laboratory data, as well as brain CT findings of patients with cerebrovascular complications following OLT are shown in an Additional Table (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>Among the 8 patients with intracranial hemorrhage, two of them received decompressive craniectomy and evacuation of intracranial hematoma, but both died of brain herniation soon after the surgery.

Altogether, six of 10 patients with in-hospital cerebrovascular complications died following OLT.</p><p>To analyze the possible risk factors and outcome of intracranial hemorrhage following OLT, we compared the clinical and laboratory data between the patients with and without intracranial hemorrhage (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

But cerebrovascular events, especially intracranial hemorrhage, have been concerned as severe neurological complications after transplantation. The reported clinical incidences of cerebrovascular complications were 1.7%&#x02013;6.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and the mortality rate of cerebrovascular complications or intracranial hemorrhage were 57%&#x02013;100% following OLT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, the incidence was 32.7% in autopsy cases of patients who underwent OLT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Cerebrovascular complications are also common in other transplantation patients. It has been reported that the incidence of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes was 6.8% after kidney transplantation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], 2.9% after bone marrow transplantation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], 0.9% after reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and 2% in pediatric patients after cardiac transplantation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Our study showed that the incidence of cerebrovascular complications in patients of southern China who underwent OLT was 3.0%, and 6 of 10 died, which was similar to the previous international reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These data indicate cerebrovascular events, especially intracranial hemorrhage, are severe posttransplant complications which deserve more attention for the neurologists, neuro-intensivists and surgeons for organ transplantion, and more endeavours should be done prospectively to identify or aviod such complications in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical and neuroimaging features</title><p>In our study, the intracranial hemorrhage patients presented with unconsciousness, headache, aphasia, hemiparesis, seizures, which was consistent with the findings of previous report[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These presentations were similar to common stroke, but with more urgent onset, progressing clinical course and rapid deterioration at early stage. In our experience, sudden conscious disturbance (or loss of consciousness) after OLT was strongly associated with intracranial hemorrhage. In the present of coagulopathy, metabolic disturbance or multiple organ failure in early postoperative time, liver transplantation recipients were prone to developed massive intracranial hematomas. Moreover, these hematomas were not prone to cease spontaneously and might enlarge gradually or rebleed, even with a tendency to form cerebral herniation, which results in the death. It is important to examine the consciousness and pupils in patients after OLT. Brain CT scan shoud be performed promptly to identify whether intracranial hemorrhage occurs once the patient has sudden conscious disturbance or loss of consciousness following OLT. Additionally, liver transplantation recipients may occurr ischemic infarction due to the haemodynamic change and coagulopathy, and then develop hemorrhagic infarction, then deteriorated rapidly.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible risk factors</title><p>Most liver transplantation recipients are in the end-stage of liver diseases, preoperative liver dysfunction even liver failure results in thrombocytopenia and absence of coagulation factors. Moreover, liver function may not return to normal level in the postoperative early stage. All these could result in coagulopathy, which can trigger intracranial hemorrhage after OLT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. But in our series, no significant differences were found in the incidence of thrombocytopenia, PT, or APPT between the patients with and without intracranial hemorrhage, which suggests that the causes of intracranial hemorrhage after OLT are multiple and complex, except for coagulopathy, there may be other factors responsible for this complication. In our study, we found that intracranial hemorrhage patients were older than non-intracranial hemorrhage patients, moreover, the patients over 55 years had a more frequency of intracranial hemorrhage than those less than 55 years old. Additionly, the patients with systemic infection had a more frequency of intracranial hemorrhage than those without infection. The results indicate that older age and systemic infection might be important risk factors of intracranial hemorrhage following OLT. Cox and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] reported that an 11-year-old boy who had cystic fibrosis died of an intraventricular and intracerebral hemorrhage caused by an aspergillus brain abscess on the 48th day after OLT. Wijdicks and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] reported that in the group of 8 patients with intracranial hemorrhage after OLT, one had a Candida-associated mycotic aneurysm demonstrated by autopsy and another had disseminated aspergillosis. Generally, it is presumed that under the condition of systemic infection related to immunosuppresion following OLT, aspergillus, toxoplasma and any virulent bacterial organism may lead to inflammation of the arterial wall and formation of an aneurysm[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In our series, seven of the 8 patients with intracranial hemorrhage had systemic bacterial or fungal infection, and all that them had pneumonia, including 4 with bacterial pneumonia, one with aspergillus pneumonia, one with aspergillus combinded Candida tropicalis pneumonia and one with bacterial pneumonia combinded urinary tract infection respectively. But it was very pitiful that no evidence to support bacterial or fungal infection is the direct cause of intracranial hemorrhage due to no vascular image or post-mortem exams in the present study. A published study showed that patients with introperative hypotension were prone to develop cerebral infarction after OLT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the present study, one patient over 60 years old with cerebral infarction indeed had introperative hypotension, indicating introperative hypotension may be a potential risk factor of cerebral infarction after OLT.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although posttransplant cerebrovascular complications are not common, they have severe impact on outcome of the patients who received OLT. Age and systemic infection may be the possible risk factors of in-hospital intracranial hemorrhage following OLT. More effctive measures should be taken to prevent posttransplant infection, such as improvement of patient's systemic condition, bacteriologic surveillance and infection control measures. It is urgent to early diagnosis and take more prompt systemic antibiotic/antifungal therapy once infection occurs, especially in old patients. Further prospective study is necessary to explore the risk factors and optimize the preventive and therapeutic regimen of intracranial hemorrhage following OLT.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LL collected the data and wrote the primary manuscript.
