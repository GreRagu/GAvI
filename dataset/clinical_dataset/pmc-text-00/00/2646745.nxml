Modified cellular glycosylation patterns may provide a potentially valuable, yet largely unexplored, opportunity for enhanced cancer <italic>diagnostics</italic>. A recent discovery of advanced branching in the glycoforms of prostate specific antigen (PSA) isolated from the LnCaP prostate cancer cell line, and not found in normal prostate cells, is potentially interesting from the perspective of diagnostics.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>) PSA, a 28-kDa glycoprotein secreted exclusively by the prostatic epithelium, consists of 237 amino acids and contains a single <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) The high tissue selectivity of PSA renders it potentially valuable as a marker for emerging prostate cancer. The development of immunoassays to measure PSA levels has provided an important breakthrough in prostate cancer diagnostics.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>) Unfortunately, the very common problem of interpreting borderline PSA levels, necessary to differentiate between prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia, has consistently complicated the efforts of clinicians.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>) A number of methods have been suggested to overcome this problem, including determinations of free vs total PSA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>) (PSA index) and monitoring the increase of PSA levels for a particular patient(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) (PSA velocity); however, the utility of such potential measures remains unverified.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>)</p><p>All current state-of-the-art PSA-directed immunoassays employ antibodies that recognize only its peptide backbone. Such assays are therefore unable to differentiate between the various <italic>N</italic>-linked glycoforms of the protein. Thus, a potentially valuable criterion for discrimination between normal and transformed PSA remains invisible under the current methods.</p><p>Analyses of PSA glycosylation patterns suggest that normal PSA variants contain only biantennary <italic>N</italic>-linked glycoforms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> in which the mannose units of the pentasaccharide core are symmetrically glycosylated with <italic>N</italic>-acetyllactosamine units at the 2 and 2&#x02032; positions, as in glycopeptide <bold>1</bold> (Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref>). These lactosamines may be further modified through sialylation. By contrast, PSA samples isolated from prostate cancer cells appear to display tri- and even tetrabranched <italic>N</italic>-glycans,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>) such as in structures <bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold> (Scheme <xref rid="sch1" ref-type="scheme">1</xref>).

While the exact structures of these transformed PSA glycans have not always been determined, these findings are certainly in line with the expectation of a higher degree of branching of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycoforms associated with neoplastic cells.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>)</p><fig id="sch1" position="float"><label>Scheme 1</label><caption><title><italic>N</italic>-Linked Branching of Normal (<bold>1</bold>) and Transformed (<bold>2</bold> and <bold>3</bold>) Desialylated PSA Glycoforms</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ja-2008-028137_0003" id="gs1" position="float"/></fig><p>The research described below(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) was driven by two goals. First, total synthesis of the PSA associable oligosaccharide patterns constitutes a formidable challenge to the state of the art of the field and, as such, would serve as a testing ground to evaluate operations at the perimeter of current feasibility. Moreover, the identification of antibodies sensitive to particular PSA glycoforms, accessed through total synthesis, could form the basis for the development of a new immunoassay capable of elucidating not just levels of PSA, but also the metastatic propensity of the disease. Our approach toward eliciting such distinguishing antibodies is summarized in Scheme <xref rid="sch2" ref-type="scheme">2</xref>. Animal immunization with glycosylated PSA fragments conjugated to a carrier protein (such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)) and subsequent screening of serum could lead to the identification of the desired antibodies specific for single PSA glycoforms. It seemed that the total chemical synthesis of these types of complex and highly branched <italic>N</italic>-linked glycopeptides had never previously been accomplished. Yet, <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis would likely be the only way by which to gain access to completely homogeneous glycosylated PSA fragments in substantial quantities. To pursue this study, we elected to synthesize three glycopeptide fragments, each containing the uneicosapeptide portion of the PSA backbone flanking the glycosylation site (PSA(27&#x02212;47)), and presenting either the di-, tri-, or tetrabranched glycans found in structures <bold>1</bold>, <bold>2</bold>, and <bold>3</bold>, in unsialylated form. As sialylation adds a considerable degree of heterogeneity to glycoprotein, such samples are typically subjected to sialydase digestion prior to analysis.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>) Hence, our constructs did not contain sialic acids at their nonreducing termini, though in principle, they could be accommodated. As will be shown herein, we found that antibody binding to our synthetic glycopeptide constructs did exhibit modest selectivity, though binding was weaker than with peptide epitopes.</p><fig id="sch2" position="float"><label>Scheme 2</label><caption><title>Proposed Identification of Antibodies Sensitive to Neoplastic PSA Glycoforms</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ja-2008-028137_0004" id="gs2" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>The construction of complex homogeneous glycopeptides can generally be broadly divided into three synthetic tasks: (1) the preparation of the peptide sequence, (2) the synthesis of the glycan region, and (3) the merging of the two domains. While advances in automated peptide synthesis have greatly simplified the first task, the latter two still present daunting challenges to the synthetic organic chemist. In order to achieve efficient glycopeptide conjugation, we envisioned a route consisting of amination of the free reducing end of the carbohydrate, followed by coupling of the resulting &#x003b2;-amino group with a short Asp-containing peptide. Finally, native chemical ligation could be employed to further elongate the peptide chain.</p><p>We sought to design a highly convergent approach that could allow for access to all three carbohydrate domains from a single precursor. This would be of significant advantage, since sequential preparations of each separate domain would be likely to be highly &#x0201c;step intensive&#x0201d;. We hoped to achieve maximal efficiency through the simultaneous glycosylation of the pentasaccharide diol (<bold>5</bold>), triol (<bold>6</bold>), or tetraol (<bold>7</bold>) with either two, three, or four <italic>N</italic>-acetyllactosamine units (Scheme <xref rid="sch3" ref-type="scheme">3</xref>). <italic>In this way, the construction of both the symmetrically (2,2&#x02032;) and asymmetrically (2,2&#x02032;,4 and 2,4,2&#x02032;,6&#x02032;) branched glycans would ultimately be accomplished from a common building block.</italic> Each of the required pentasaccharides was to be derived from trisaccharide <bold>4</bold>, which was deliberately designed to allow for either sequential or simultaneous exposure of the 3 and 6 hydroxyl groups of the terminal mannose.</p><fig id="sch3" position="float"><label>Scheme 3</label><caption><title>A Route Toward the Synthesis of Arbitrarily Branched PSA Glycopeptides from a Single Trisaccharide Precursor</title></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ja-2008-028137_0005" id="gs3" position="float"/></fig><p>Two significant changes were built into our strategic plan for the total syntheses to be pursued under the PSA program. In our earlier glycopeptide syntheses, based on glycal assembly, the reducing end was carried to the end of the synthesis as a glycal linkage.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>) In the syntheses described here, the terminal glycal is converted at a much earlier stage (see compound <bold>4</bold>) to the GlcNAc pattern, thereby avoiding the need to conduct such technically demanding steps at the end of the synthesis.</p><p>Moreover, by the new scheme, the interior mannose (see ring C, compound <bold>4</bold>) would be introduced by direct &#x003b2;-mannosylation. In our earlier approaches to complex mannose-based <italic>N</italic>-linked glycopeptides, the corresponding interior &#x003b2;-linked mannose moiety had been fashioned through epimerization of a &#x003b2;-glucoside precursor (by an oxidation&#x02212;reduction sequence at C<sub>2</sub>).(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>) By contrast, in the PSA synthesis, we would be employing direct &#x003b2;-mannosylation according to Crich,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>) using Kahne&#x02019;s sulfoxide as the glycosyl donor.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>)</p><p>The decision was also made to equip the reducing end of <bold>4</bold> with a <italic>tert</italic>-butylsilyl (TBS)-protected alcohol, hoping to avoid the need for the glycal in the late stages of the synthesis. The stability of anomeric alcohols to the dissolving metal reduction conditions required for the global deprotection had been previously demonstrated in our laboratory.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>)</p><p>The synthesis of trisaccharide <bold>4</bold>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) commenced with the known disaccharide glycal <bold>8</bold>, itself prepared through glycal assembly techniques developed in our laboratory. The double bond of <bold>8</bold> was subjected to iodosulfonamidation, and both resulting iodosulfonamide isomers were subsequently converted to the reducing disaccharide, <bold>9</bold> (Scheme <xref rid="sch4" ref-type="scheme">4</xref>). Interestingly, only the &#x003b1;-anomer of <bold>9</bold> was formed, possibly due to the stabilization of the axial hydroxide through intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C<sub>2</sub> sulfonamide. The &#x003b1;-configuration of the anomeric hydroxyl group could be preserved through silylation with excess TBSOTf. Deacetylation of the resultant disaccharide, under Zempl&#x000e9;n conditions, provided the requisite acceptor <bold>10</bold> in 53&#x02212;60% yield over four steps. In a defining step in the synthesis, direct &#x003b2;-mannosylation, under the Crich glycosylation protocol, was efficiently achieved through exposure to the presumed mannosyl triflate, generated <italic>in situ</italic> from the corresponding mannosyl sulfoxide, <bold>11</bold>. Using a modest excess (1.5 equiv) of disaccharide <bold>10</bold>, mannosyl coupling could be achieved with good levels of stereoselectivity (8:1, &#x003b2;:&#x003b1;), to provide trisaccharide <bold>12</bold> in 85&#x02212;91% yields. The excess acceptor <bold>10</bold> could be recovered intact and reused. Deprotection of <bold>12</bold> provided the key trisaccharide building block, <bold>4</bold>. Under this sequence, significant amounts of <bold>4</bold> were obtained, with the largest scale-up effort yielding 25 g of trisaccharide. Finally, the 4,6-benzylidene functionality of <bold>4</bold> could be reduced by the action of borane/tetrahydrofuran (THF) complex and dibutylboron triflate to afford <bold>13</bold>. This compound, bearing the two required acceptor sites at C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>6</sub> of the interior mannose, was destined to be a key building block as the synthesis unfolded.</p><fig id="sch4" position="float"><label>Scheme 4</label><caption><title>Synthesis of the Key Trisaccharide from Chitobiose Glycal<xref rid="sch4-fn1"/></title><p id="sch4-fn1">Reagents and conditions: (a) I(coll)<sub>2</sub>ClO<sub>4</sub>, PhSO<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>; (b) Et<sub>3</sub>N, H<sub>2</sub>O/THF; (c) TBSOTf, 2,6-lutidine, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>; (d) NaOMe/MeOH; 53&#x02212;60% for four steps; (e) i.

Because the starting material containing the free reducing end hydroxyl group and the product amine differ by only a single mass unit, the reaction was monitored by evaluating the product isotope ratios obtained via mass spectrometry of the reaction mixture. Removal of the solvent and the volatile salts was accomplished by repeated lyophilization.

Fmoc removal with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide (DMF) provided the free trisaccharide pentapeptide (<bold>16</bold>) in 68% yield. Native chemical ligation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) performed on an analytical scale with a 14-mer C-terminal thioester (<bold>17</bold>) showed substantial completion within 2&#x02212;3 h, but technical challenges arose which, unaddressed, would have impeded the isolation of the desired product. LCMS indicated that the mercaptoethanesulfonate (MES) thioester derivative of the <italic>N</italic>-terminal coupling partner (used in excess) essentially coeluted with the desired material, as did its carboxylic acid derivative. Simply allowing the thioester to hydrolyze would be insufficient as a method for removing the 14-residue byproduct. Fortunately, trapping of the MES thioester intermediate with cysteamine proved to be an effective method for altering the compound&#x02019;s polarity, thus allowing its effective separation from the desired product, even on larger scale reactions. By adding a 20-min cysteamine &#x0201c;quench&#x0201d; following reaction completion, it was possible to repeat the NCL on a large scale, and to isolate analytically pure <italic>N</italic>-linked trisaccharide nonadecapeptide (<bold>19</bold>) in 78% yield.</p><p>Having demonstrated the feasibility of the amination/ligation sequence with the model trisaccharide system, we sought to prepare the normal, dibranched PSA glycopeptide, <bold>1</bold>. It would first be necessary to prepare the pentasaccharide diol, <bold>5</bold>, through two-fold glycosylation of trisaccharide <bold>13</bold>. This transformation would require two high-yielding glycosylation events. A number of protocols were assessed for their ability to provide maximal yield and minimal orthoester formation. Ultimately, bis-glycosylation of <bold>13</bold> under Sinay radical cation activation conditions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>) with excess &#x003b1;-mannosyl donor, <bold>20</bold>, proved to be most efficient, furnishing the pentasaccharide adduct in 74% yield, with little or no concomitant orthoester formation. Saponification of the two benzoyl groups afforded the pentasaccharide diol, <bold>5</bold>. Subsequent two-fold glycosylation with disaccharide donor <bold>21</bold> under MeOTf activation proceeded smoothly. Following conversion of the phthalimide functionalities to acetates and liberation of the anomeric hydroxyl group, compound <bold>22</bold>, representing the fully protected nonasaccharide domain of the target system (<bold>1</bold>), was in hand. At this stage, we were able to take advantage of an earlier remarkable finding to the effect that the integrity of the &#x0201c;free&#x0201d; reducing end hemiacetals in such systems can be maintained even under Birch debenzylation conditions. Global deprotection, followed by amine-specific diacetylation, yielded the free glycan <bold>23</bold> as a mixture of anomers.

KLH has proven to be effective in numerous vaccine applications because of its many foreign epitopes, large molecular mass, and poor solubility. Using the unique thiol on the glycopeptide as a convenient handle for conjugation to a maleimide-functionalized KLH, we prepared an extensively functionalized KLH system. In order to prevent precipitation due to resilient thiol (from cysteine) cross-linking, KLH was first reacted with maleimidobutyric acid in order to block the free thiols (Scheme <xref rid="sch11" ref-type="scheme">11</xref>). This preliminary step allowed for a higher degree of maleimide functionalization, and also provided stability to the construct. The lysines of KLH were derivatized using a large excess of succinimidyl 4-[<italic>N</italic>-maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC). Up to 1000 maleimide moieties were grafted on KLH using this protocol, as assessed by <sup>35</sup>S-cysteine labeling. Coupling of glycopeptide <bold>2</bold> to this activated KLH yielded a conjugate bearing 300 residues, as assessed by carbohydrate high-performance liquid chromatography analysis after total hydrolysis (data not shown).

About 10% of the hybridomas were found to be positive and were tested for recognition of the nontransformed glycopeptide <bold>1</bold>. Our goal was to select antibodies binding preferentially to the tribranched, transformed glycopeptide <bold>2</bold> compared to the normal, dibranched glycopeptide <bold>1</bold>, thereby allowing us to discard antibodies that were likely to be directed against the peptidic moiety of the antigen. When tested in parallel in at least two independent experiments, a selectivity ranging from 2- to 4-fold in favor of the tribranched glycopeptide <bold>2</bold> compared to the dibranched glycopeptide <bold>1</bold> was confirmed for 17 clones, which were selected for further experiments (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Binding of selected hybridoma supernatants to the tribranched glycopeptide <bold>2</bold> compared to the dibranched glycopeptide <bold>1</bold>.

These tests were done on hybridoma supernatant fluids and not purified monoclonal antibodies, and antibodies generated against carbohydrates are often of lower affinity. Therefore, absolute titers of individual hybridomas cannot be compared. In addition, we had purposely immunized the mice against the PSA glycopeptide <bold>2</bold>, which is devoid of any sialyl group, in order to prevent the generation of antibodies directed against this ubiquitous moiety. LnCap PSA carbohydrates, however, are likely to be sialylated, which could affect both of the recognized epitopes through masking or conformational changes. Antibodies recognizing nonsialylated PSA carbohydrates might therefore not bind to their sialylated counterparts. To test this hypothesis, we measured the binding of our hybridoma supernatants to desialylated LnCap PSA. A positive control monoclonal antibody included in these tests, H117, which is reactive with the peptide moiety of PSA,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) showed strong binding to both sialylated and desialylated peptides, as expected. Small increases in the binding to LnCap PSA after desialylation were observed for four of the six tested supernatants, sometimes resulting in up to a 2-fold increase in binding (data not shown). This result suggests that some of the generated antibodies recognized a desialylated carbohydrate moiety of native LnCap PSA better than the sialylated forms; however, only small changes were observed. The small difference in binding observed after desialylation of LnCap PSA is consistent with a report in which LnCap PSA has little sialic acid.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>) Desialylation of LnCap PSA would therefore be expected to affect only moderately the binding of the antibodies that we have generated against the desialylated glycopeptide <bold>2</bold>. Interestingly, when we measured the binding of the 17 selected hybridoma supernatants to the serum of a patient with prostate cancer, we observed an increase in binding after desialylation for 13 of 17 supernatants tested ranging from 2- to 3-fold (data not shown). While this result could not be repeated due to the limited amounts of hybridoma supernatant fluids available, we have identified a trend suggesting that the antibodies raised against the nonsialylated glycopeptide <bold>2</bold> can recognize the desialylated glycan moiety of PSA from a patient serum.</p><p>We note also that the determination of the actual glycobiology and structural chemistry of these glycans is still a work in progress.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) As firmer answers to these highly complex structural issues are available, the synthetic chemistry addressed to simulating nuances of the various PSA related antigens can be adapted. In this way, one can hope to improve the correspondence of the chemical construct with the cell surface, thereby achieving more selective and more discerning induced antibody&#x02212;natural antigen affinities.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we have shown the feasibility of preparation of highly complex <italic>N</italic>-linked glycopeptides through entirely chemical means. In this case, di-, tri-, and tetrabranched glycans have been synthesized from a single trisaccharide precursor with most diversity introduction performed at the end of the oligosaccharide assembly. Amination of such glycans followed by coupling/NCL sequence allows attachment of long peptide motifs. We have also demonstrated that significant glycopeptide loading on carrier proteins can be achieved through maleimide modification/Michael addition. The possibility of selective recognition of the 11-mer carbohydrate vs the 9-mer as well as a significant increase in binding upon sialidase digestion of PSA suggests the potential of this methodology for providing a path toward a new, more selective prostate cancer diagnostic assay. While a trend suggesting binding of the newly generated antibodies to both LnCap PSA and serum from a prostate cancer patient after desialylation has been detected, further optimization of both antigen structure and antibody preparation is required before a practical use of the assay can be projected.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Support for this work was provided by the NIH (CA23766 and CA55349 to D.A.S. and CA103823 to S.J.D.).
