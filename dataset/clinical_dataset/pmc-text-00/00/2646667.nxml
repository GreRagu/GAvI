While copper catalysis has been widely employed to activate terminal alkynes for [3 + 2] cycloaddition, this method, often termed &#x0201c;click chemistry&#x0201d;, is currently incompatible with living systems because of the toxicity of the metal. We recently reported a difluorinated cyclooctyne (DIFO) reagent that rapidly reacts with azides in living cells without the need for copper catalysis. Here we report a novel class of DIFO reagents for copper-free click chemistry that are considerably more synthetically tractable. The new analogues maintained the same elevated rates of [3 + 2] cycloaddition as the parent compound and were used for imaging glycans on live cells. These second-generation DIFO reagents should expand the use of copper-free click chemistry in the hands of biologists.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ja803086r</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ja-2008-03086r</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The term &#x0201c;click chemistry&#x0201d; describes a collection of organic reactions that proceed rapidly and selectively under mild conditions to covalently link molecular components.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>) Among the many click reactions described to date, the Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azides and alkynes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>) has received the most attention.

The synthesis of these reagents involves a novel method for one-step difluorination of 1,3-diketones, a selective Wittig reaction to install the linkers, and the use of an orthoester as a cyclooctyne-compatible protecting group. Furthermore, these reagents can be prepared efficiently, with overall yields that are more than 20-fold higher than that of the first-generation reagent. Critically, we determined that these novel DIFO reagents are nontoxic to cells and can selectively tag azide-labeled biomolecules in living systems with efficiencies approaching that of the parent compound. We envision that these reagents will enable widespread use of copper-free click chemistry in the context of in vivo imaging and ex vivo labeling of biomolecules and in the generation of novel biocompatible materials.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>)</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by a grant to C.R.B. from the National Institutes of Health (GM058867).
