The patient growth was generally retarded. Some exostoses and shape anomalies were present on the extremities and vertebral column. In anamnesis, his mother reported that, he was diagnosed as MHO at early childhood at one of Faculty of Medicine. Mother had not got any serious problem during pregnancy and there was not kinship between mother and father. The baby had a normal body shape after birth, but the several deformities and outgrowth of the bones had begun to occur at the age of 2. When the MHO was diagnosed, the medical treatment was started immediately. The patient has been treating with Vitamin D (Devit-3 oral drop, 400 IU/day, daily use), Calcium (Calcimed Fort effervescent tablet, 500 mg/day, daily use) and Etidronate disodium (Didronat-PMO tablet, 400 mg/day, to be used in a scheme once a day for 15 days following an interruption duration of 2.5 months) to prevent from osteoporosis. His mother reported that, he had severe gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting with every intaking periods of Didronat. He had also more carious lesions. The chewing and eating difficulties and an inadequate nutrition were present. There was a general physical weakness. Growth was negatively affected by MHO and malnutrition.</p><p>His height was 124 centimeters and his weight was 21 kilograms. The growth of body was seen retarded according to other children in the same age. Several skeletal deformities were present on extremities and vertebras. The right and left forearms, wrists and shoulders, right shank and patella and left side of thorax were affected by disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-0010183">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-0010183">2</xref>). Mental retardation was not present.</p><p>Oral hygiene was very poor. In clinical and radiographical examinations, there were severe carious lesions on 11, 21, 12, 22, 31, 41, 32, 42, 73, 83 numbered teeth and remained roots were present from 74, 75, 36, 46 numbered teeth. 16 and 26 numbered teeth were not present. It was learned that, they were more previously extracted caused by severe carious lesions and pain. It was seen that, the rotation of the 23, 24 and 25 numbered teeth was abnormal in panoramic radiography and they were not shown in oral cavity yet. Wide plaque layers were present on the surfaces of the teeth and roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-0010183">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-0010183">4</xref>).</p><p>An effective tooth-brushing method was shown. The oral hygiene behaviours were rearranged. Essential diet recommendations were given and a topical fluoride gel was applied. The patient was prescribed with a chlorhexidine gluconate solution to reduce the levels of pathogen microorganisms before dental treatment. All remained roots with excessive carious lesions were then extracted (74,75,36,46 numbered teeth).</p><p>The carious lesions on 11,21,12,22,31,41,32,42 ,73,83 numbered teeth were cleaned with a high speed, water-cooled dental torgue (KaVo Super Torque, Germany) and teeth were then restored with a composite resin and a total-etch adhesive system (Charisma composite resin, Heraeus-Kulzer, Germany, Single Bond adhesive system, 3M,USA).</p><p>A consultation with Department of Orthodontics was made for patient. With two clinical considerations together, to make removable partial dentures for providing a sufficient chewing function immediately and observation of oral condition with frequently dental visits were approved for treatment. Impressions of the both arches were then taken, and removable partial dentures were made for both dental arches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-0010183">Figure 5</xref>). Regularly dental visits were recommended to the patient and observation of oral condition with frequently dental controls were approved for future treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Osteochondromatosis, also known as osteocartilaginous exostosis is the most frequent benign bone tumor of the skeletal system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-0010183">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-0010183">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-0010183">22</xref> Osteochondroma may occur in some short bones and may develope endochondral ossification despite its preference for long bones.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-0010183">22</xref> Affected individuals exhibit bilateral deformities and multiple osteochondromas in the hands, wrists, legs and feet. The forearms and wrists are the most common influenced sites.

This impaired oral hygiene, in turn, may have facilitated local infection leading to advanced bone necrosis (osteonecrosis),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-0010183">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-0010183">25</xref> and subsequent increased tooth mobility and loss. Past dental history for many of the patients revealed recent tooth extraction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-0010183">24</xref></p><p>Didronat (Etidronate disodium) which was used medicament in this case is one of drugs of Bisphosphonates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-0010183">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-0010183">30</xref> It increases the BMD and bone turnover but may also give rise to some GIS symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-0010183">30</xref> and/or esophageal lesions such as oesophagitis or oesophageal ulceration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-0010183">29</xref> Repeating vomitings cause to acidic levels of oral pH in oral cavity and acidic pH helps to starting and developing of the carious lesions on the teeth. If patient does not adequately brushes his/her teeth daily, bad oral hygiene rapidly boosts this condition. Carious lesions cause to loss of the dental structures of the teeth. The chewing and eating difficulties may occur owing to the structural lost in time. Insufficient nutrition may affect growth negatively and quality of life may also decrease.</p><p>In our case, adverse GIS effects of Didronat was also caused to bad oral hygiene and some GIS reactions. Therefore, several carious lesions, loss of teeth and malnutrition were occurred and all these symptoms have been negatively affected the growth and life quality of the child. The preventive and other dental treatments are very important and necessary to obtain a good oral condition and sufficient chewing and eating functions. The improved nutrition may provide a better life quality for the patient. So, necessary dental treatments were made for obtaining these better conditions and patient was also called for regularly dental controls and possible necessary dental treatments in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In this case report, a male patient in 11-years-old was presented with common severe carious lesions caused by repeated vomitings due to the mandatory using of a medicine (Didronat) for MHO and also bad oral hygiene.
