However, the population of <italic>B. (Hemigrammocapoeta) mirei</italic> Est&#x000e8;ve, 1952, which had been described from the Ksar Torchane spring is now extinct.

Although Monod cast doubt on their validity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004400-Monod2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, he nevertheless recognised the specific morphological characteristics (incomplete lateral line) of this population of barbs and recommended further studies in order to understand their origin. With the drying-up of the spring and the extinction of this population, this has now become impossible. The information gathered on the ground clearly indicates that the further deterioration in the rainfall deficit in 1982 and 1983 (19 mm and 7 mm of rainfall in Atar respectively), occurring after twelve years of drought, caused the spring to run dry definitively in early 1984.</p><fig id="pone-0004400-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004400.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Adrar mountains fishes.</title><p>A : <italic>Barbus macrops</italic>, Hamdoun guelta &#x0003b; B : <italic>Barbus pobeguini</italic>, Hamdoun guelta &#x0003b; C : <italic>Sarotherodon g. galilaeus</italic>, Molomhar guelta &#x0003b; D : Juvenile <italic>Clarias anguillaris</italic>, Hamdoun guelta.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004400.g005"/></fig><p>Three of the pools and gueltas in the Timinit and Nb&#x000e9;&#x000ef;k&#x000e9; wadis where Monod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004400-Monod1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004400-Monod2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> had reported the presence of <italic>B. pobeguini</italic> became ephemeral from 1984 and 1990 onwards, having been perennial before. This was probably due to the reduced underground flow of these wadis which in turn was caused by the ongoing drought. The four pools in the Nb&#x000e9;&#x000ef;k&#x000e9; and Nkede&#x000ef; wadis where the presence of <italic>B. pobeguini</italic> is mentioned for the first time in this study are thought by the populations of the neighbouring oases to have always been perennial. It is likely that the population of <italic>B. pobeguini</italic> for which they provide a habitat is a longstanding one but that it escaped previous investigations.</p><p>Of the perennial bodies of water which provide a habitat for fish and which have proved resistant to the ongoing drought, the Hamdoun guelta appears to be the most endangered. In July 2007 its volume was just 1.7 m<sup>3</sup> with a maximum depth of 35 cm. Two months previously the guelta was still fed by a trickle of water seeping from the length of the cliff wall and providing approximately 0.7 litres of water per minute, but this seep had almost completely dried up in July and was in danger of not compensating for the very high rate of evaporation caused by the heat at this time of the year. With three species of fish present, the Hamdoun guelta presents the second greatest species richness after the Molomhar guelta. The equilibrium maintained between <italic>C. anguillaris</italic> on the one hand, and <italic>B. pobeguini</italic> and <italic>B. macrops</italic> on the other, is noteworthy. The seven adult catfish measuring 22 to 35 cm in length found in the guelta in 2006&#x02013;07 could easily have killed off the two small populations of barbs - certainly fewer than two hundred individuals - which survived in July 2007. A few pieces of bread thrown into the guelta were immediately fought over by the three species. The rises in water level caused by the rains of August and September 2007, which gave rise to abundant batches of eggs, allowed the barb populations of the guelta to at least double in size within one month (310 specimens counted in September 2007) and to colonise a large number of ephemeral downstream gueltas. The absence of any fish population upstream of the road overlooking the perennial guelta, contrary to observations in the 1950s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004400-Monod1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004400-Villiers1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, confirms the increased vulnerability of the Hamdoun guelta. It should also be noted that a single road accident involving one of the many lorries which use this dangerous mountain road could cause a pollution incident which would definitively wipe out the fish population in the guelta.</p><p>The Molomhar gueltas are still the most noteworthy aquatic system in the Adrar region of Mauritania and West Central Sahara. It is the only system which is home to four species of fish, and the only system in the whole central Sahara where <italic>Sarotherodon g. galilaeus</italic> has been able to survive since the Holocene period. Along with the neighbouring Il&#x000ee;j guelta and several Tibesti gueltas in Chad, it is also one of the few Sahara sites where a freshwater jellyfish, <italic>Limnocnida tanganyicae</italic>, has been observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004400-g006">Figure 6</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004400-Dekeyser2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004400-Dumont3">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The reduced recorded rainfall does not seem to have affected the dry period water level, given that a similar depth of 6 m in the first guelta had been measured in February 1951 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004400-Villiers1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Two kilometres downstream of the gueltas, at the entrance to the Oumm Lemhar wadi canyon, an underground water harvesting system has been installed in order to provide water for the town of Atar but it does not seem to have had a major impact on the perennial gueltas. Several thousand specimens of <italic>S. g. galilaeus</italic>, <italic>B. pobeguini</italic> and <italic>B. macrops</italic> were present in the gueltas. The size of the population of <italic>C. anguillaris</italic> could not be estimated, but it is certainly much less numerous.</p><fig id="pone-0004400-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004400.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>The freshwater jellyfish <italic>Limnocnida tanganyicae</italic>, Molomhar guelta.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004400.g006"/></fig><p>Two large hydrographic networks cover the Adrar region of Mauritania: to the north and west, the Seguell&#x000ee;l wadi network, which occasionally comes into contact with the El Abiod wadi&#x0003b; to the south and east, the Timinit wadi network, into which flow the Nb&#x000e9;&#x000ef;k&#x000e9; and Nkede&#x000ef; wadis.

An in-depth genetic comparison of these fish populations with those in the Senegal and Niger basins has yet to be completed. It is currently in progress and should improve our knowledge of when the different basins separated and state precisely whether the levels of divergence reached are compatible with the recognition of distinct specific or subspecific entities.</p><p>Despite a drought which has lasted for nearly forty years with an intensity which is without known historical precedent, the relict species of tropical fish in the mountains of the Adrar region of Mauritania continue to survive. However, they appear to be highly endangered. Of the thirteen sites mentioned in the literature, four are no longer home to fish, at least on a permanent basis, and one appears to be highly endangered. In the basin of the Timinit, Nb&#x000e9;&#x000ef;k&#x000e9; and Nkede&#x000ef; wadis, three of the five perennial pools or gueltas previously known to provide a habitat for <italic>B. pobeguini</italic> have become ephemeral. In the Seguell&#x000ee;l wadi basin, the Ksar Torchane spring dried up definitively in 1984, bringing about the extinction of one of the most noteworthy Saharan populations of barb. New fish population extinctions may occur should very low levels of annual recorded rainfall be repeated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>I am thankful to Jean-Jacques Albaret, IRD Montpellier, who participated in the December 2007 survey and examined part of the specimens collected.
