The ARVO is the world&#x02032;s largest such organization, with more than 12,100 members from over 70 countries, of which 14% are from Asia. The annual meeting attracts over 10,200 researchers from around the world. This year, the participation of Indian researchers and ophthalmologists increased by 12% over 2006. Of the 21 abstracts submitted from researchers in India, 19 were accepted for presentation.	</p><p>In addition to participation in the ARVO, there has been increased participation in the biennial ARVO Asia conference. In 2007, 102 researchers from India attended the conference, representing the second largest contingent from participating countries. Based on feedback from interviews, 56% of attendees saw a positive effect on research and clinical work and 80% stated that the conference helped them build contacts for future research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has also signed a United States-India Statement of Intent for collaboration on expansion of vision research; this demonstrates the increased commitment of Indian researchers and clinicians to joint collaborations on eye research.	</p><p>As members of the international committee and the Host-A-Researcher program of ARVO, we would like to take this opportunity to encourage further participation by Indian researchers. Although much progress has already been made, the contributions of Indian researchers to the field are disproportionate to their enormous potential. Of the top ten submissions to Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science (IOVS) by country, India has not yet made the list. More attempts must be made to publish internationally, so that research from India may be recognized, shared, and built upon. Currently there are 75 travel grants available for ARVO attendees from outside the United States, and more are planned for next year. India already maintains substantial infrastructure for education and clinical care that would facilitate research and international collaboration. Researchers should seize this opportunity to contribute, collaborate and benefit from research occurring in other countries.	</p><p>We urge all vision researchers and Ophthalmologists to continue to attend ARVO and other international conferences in greater numbers and use this opportunity to make contacts and share ideas. The world is becoming a much smaller place. We have at our disposal all the resources needed to make great strides in research and clinical care. It is incumbent on all of us to use these resources and continue to forge new relationships as we work together to eliminate disorders of the eye. We hope to see you all in the near future.	</p></body></article>
