The state was chosen for convenience;logistical ease; and the fact that it was one of the beneficiariesof the World Bank program, as well as of a second round offunding by a local body. The first visit was undertaken by RTand the second by MD. The data were accumulated duringtwo evaluations performed 8 years apart. While the secondevaluation was &#x02032;suggested&#x02032; at the end of the first study, it was notpart of the plan when the first assessment took place. However,the methodology, as well as the data collected during the secondstudy, was based on the first.</p><p>Eight medical college departments were evaluated duringthe first visit. During the ensuing years, 3 more departments haddeveloped; and a total of 11 departments were evaluated duringthe second phase. A structured questionnaire [Appendix 1, 2]was sent out in advance to the respective heads of departmentto determine details like the number of students, patientsseen, operations done and list of the equipment available.Following this, the evaluator scheduled a site visit and spent aday in each of the departments. Details of the programs werepersonally collected and entered by the evaluator. The activitiesundertaken during this visit are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The preferred characteristics of an ophthalmology trainingprogram were specified in advance and were the consideredopinion of the first evaluator and agreed to by the second priorto the next evaluation. The features considered essential forresident training are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. The criteria consideredindicators of suitable outpatient and ward care in a medicalcollege department are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>; those for theoperating room are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>. Undergraduate trainingwas assessed using a questionnaire, observation and personalinterview only during the first evaluation.</p><p>At the time of the first visit, the World Bank training programwas underway. Fourteen &#x02032;trainer of trainers&#x02032; who had beentrained by the World Bank program were interviewed. Thequestions asked are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>.</p><p>Changes in teaching and practice pattern, including surgery,instrumentation and their use, were documented for the eightdepartments examined on the two occasions. For the threenewer departments, only their current functioning was detailed.The nature of the data permitted only a descriptive analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>First evaluation (1998)</title><p>The number of outpatients seen in the departments varied from95 (70 new and 25 old) to 1,300 (800 new, 500 old) per month.The number of beds varied from 16 to 500; and the number ofophthalmologists in each department, from 4 to 46. The numberof residents (DO and MS) ranged from 4 to 16. One departmentwas only training undergraduates. Three departments withresidency programs had no slit lamps; the maximum number offunctioning slit lamps in a department was 10. Two departmentsdid not have indirect ophthalmoscopes; five departments hadone to two in working order, while one department had six.Only one department had a functioning A-scan. The numberof cataracts done each year varied from 234 to 8,371; cataractswith intraocular lenses (IOLs) were 20 to 5,600.</p><p>None of the criteria considered necessary for patient care ina teaching department were routine in any of the departments.None of the criteria for resident teaching were met in any ofthe departments. A brief description follows.</p><p>Most departments had an adequate outpatient load, butpatients were managed (and teaching undertaken) between 9a.m. and 2 p.m. None of the departments practiced a routinecomprehensive eye examination. This concept was not taught toresidents either. Routine tonometry (even Schiotz) and fundusexamination were not the norm. Patients were dilated only rarely.This practice was prevalent even in the only hospital that had allthe essential equipment for teaching. None of the departmentshad an automated perimeter. The Goldman perimeters availablein some departments were unused. Bjerrum&#x02032;s screens were notused either. The examination pattern in all hospitals could bestbe described as what would be considered routine in an &#x02032;eyecamp.&#x02032; While there was clinical teaching, the residents did notmanage patients &#x02032;independently&#x02032; or even under supervision.They mainly observed the proceedings and participated informal case discussions. This pattern was true even in theonly department that had most of the modern ophthalmicinstrumentation.</p><p>There were several reports of essential instrumentation being&#x02032;locked up&#x02032; without access for residents, and, in some instances,even the faculty. In one department, there was a well-preserved10-year-old indirect ophthalmoscope reported to be in &#x02032;routineuse.&#x02032; The original bulb was still functioning.</p><p>The operating room (OR) design was unsuitable in six ofthe departments. The sterile area and procedures were violatedin most ORs. While most surgeons scrubbed between cases,the gowns were not changed throughout the day; gloveswere not used. A &#x02032;no touch&#x02032; technique was not used in anydepartment. Surgeons with the training and skills to performmicrosurgery could not do so, due to lack of instrumentation. Ifa microscope was available, only some surgeons were allowedto use it. Magnification for cataract surgery was not the norm;in one department, a 2-year-old child had undergone an IOLimplantation without any magnification. A-scans were notroutine in the only department that had one. Postoperative slitlamp examinations were not the norm.</p><p>Undergraduates had regular theory and clinical teaching. Inone department, findings were demonstrated on the slit lamp.The evaluator was impressed by the intelligence of, and theinterest shown by, the residents interviewed &#x02013; which he puton record. The residents too were happy with the theoreticalteaching. They all felt they got enough cataracts to do. Thenumber of intra-capsular operations performed during thecourse ranged from 15 to 150; extra-capsulars, from 0 to 300;and IOLs, from 0 to 25. Residents were not supervised in therecommended manner during surgery. None of them had beentaught an automated vitrectomy. There was no training inglaucoma or other types of operations listed. Only one of theresidents interviewed felt confident about going into practiceimmediately after graduation.</p><p><italic>Intervention:</italic> The World Bank program spent approximatelyRs. 56 crores for instrumentation, training and other costsin the chosen state. We assumed that approximately half ofthis, that is Rs. 28 crores, was used for instrumentation andtraining. The instrumentation provided included slit lamps withapplanation tonometers, teaching microscopes, A-scans andother basic instrumentation. About 5 years later, a local fundingbody provided an additional Rs. 6 crores for state-of-the-artinstrumentation - including high-quality surgical microscopes,slit lamps with applanation tonometers, phacoemulsificationmachines, additional A-scans, fundus cameras, lasers (Yag andgreen), automated perimeters and audiovisual equipment.Each department also received state-of-the-art teachingsurgical microscopes and slit lamps with beam splitters,stereo observer-scopes and monitors provided specifically forteaching purposes. In other words, the departments were aswell equipped as any medical college department anywherein the world could be.</p></sec><sec><title>Second evaluation (2006)</title><p>The number of doctors, postgraduates, beds and patients seenremained almost at the same level between the two visits.</p><p>The head of departments reported that instrumentationprovided was used &#x02032;frequently&#x02032; in 4 of the 11 departments. Onehead of department stated that patient care and teaching hadimproved considerably. All felt that the audiovisual equipmenthad improved the teaching and student presentations. However,the criteria of care and teaching considered appropriate formedical colleges [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>] were not achieved. The timings forpatient management and teaching were still 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.</p><p>A comprehensive eye examination was still not the normand was not routinely undertaken by the residents or faculty.Resident interviews revealed that the residents were notallowed to use diagnostic instruments provided for training.Applanation prisms were locked up, as were diagnostic lenses.Resident interviews also revealed that while the residents nowused microscopes for surgery, the recommended supervisionwas lacking. The teaching microscopes with the beam splittersand monitors were not made available to postgraduates; insome cases, not even to faculty. Diagnostic instruments werestill &#x02032;locked&#x02032; up.</p><p>In two departments the teaching slit lamps were usedfor demonstrations for undergraduates and residents, butresidents did not get to use the newer equipment provided.One department used the fundus camera daily. Two othershad done three fluorescein angiographies in the last year. Lasermachines were unused or sparingly used (two lasers in a year).High-end automated perimeters were available; but as theywere sparingly used, fields were not preformed for all glaucomasuspects or cases. Phacoemulsification machines were still intheir packing in three departments, and phacoemulsificationwas not the norm in any of the hospitals. None of the residentshad been taught phacoemulsification. Some had performedmanual small incision cataract surgery (SICS). A-scans wereavailable in all the departments but were not routine for allIOL surgery.</p><p>The surgical pattern had changed in that IOL usage wasnow the norm (91 to 99%). Other surgical practices, however,remained the same and actual visual outcomes were not known.An automated vitrectomy was still not routine for vitreousloss. Routine postoperative slit lamp examination was still notthe norm.</p><p>At the time of both the visits, patients were not informedabout the examinations, investigations or procedures they wereabout to undergo. An informal discussion of risks and benefitsor a formal informed consent was not the norm and was notwitnessed during either visit.</p><p>The trainer of trainer (TOT) issue was addressed formallyonly at the first visit, but, as will be seen, still has relevance. Thetrainers interviewed had been trained in one of the three centers.All were happy with their training. They had independentlyperformed the minimum number of cases stipulated by theWorld Bank. Only one training institution taught what wouldbe considered the appropriate evaluation (required of a trainer)necessary to diagnose and manage potential problems. Trainingusing a microscope with beam splitters was not impartedin most instances. Additionally, only one institution taught&#x02032;trainers&#x02032; appropriate management of vitreous loss. A &#x02032;no touch&#x02032;technique was not taught in any institution to the trainers orstudents. All 14 &#x02032;trainers of trainers&#x02032; who had returned to theirparent institutions and were interviewed were male.</p><p>Following their return from the TOT program, till the firstevaluation took place, none of the trainers had taught a singleperson. Some were doing IOLs in the department but notteaching it. However, most were doing IOLs in the privatesector. One trainer on his return was posted to the biochemistrydepartment.</p><p>Teachers interviewed during the second visit felt theirtraining was insufficient to enable them to confidently use,and teach the use of, the instrumentation provided. Many wereuncomfortable with performing or teaching phacoemulsificationas they did not have the wherewithal to manage complications.Overall, most felt they required more training. Some ofthem did, however, use the instrumentation (and performphacoemulsification) in private practice. As far as inappropriatepostings were concerned, the second evaluator too reported thatmany ophthalmologists trained in microsurgery were postedto departments of anatomy, microbiology and radiology evenwhen trainers were not available in the parent department ofophthalmology.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Residency training is crucial for the future of Indianophthalmology, as well as for the delivery of quality eye careto the population. We are aware of the constraints under whichthe publicly funded medical college departments function;however, there are public and private departments in thecountry that can compete with the best in the world. Therefore,the objective was to compare the training programs to <italic>what ispossible</italic> in the country. To the best of our knowledge, there areno published reports of on-site evaluation of residency trainingin India.</p><p>The residents were happy with the theoretical training. Theteachers felt that with the provision of audiovisual equipment,student presentations had improved dramatically. Also, IOLusage in all departments had increased dramatically and hadbecome the norm. The visual outcomes of this advance andthe occurrence of complications were however not available.Nevertheless, teaching standards and care delivery in all medicalcollege departments failed to meet the specified benchmarks, atboth the evaluations, performed <italic>after</italic> the provision of qualityequipment (and training in their use) on two separate occasions.This was true both for teaching as well as for management ofpatients. The provision of instrumentation and training hadnot effected the desired changes.</p><p>What should our training philosophy be? Patients treatedin training departments participate in the learning process.It behooves us then to ensure that the probability of bestpossible outcomes is maximized. This can only be achieved ifall patients are carefully examined not just from the trainingpoint of view, but also from the view of selecting (at least, atfirst) uncomplicated cases for training. This critical selectioncannot be achieved by a flashlight and intuition. Additionally,all surgery in such situations must be taught by experiencedsurgeons using the recommended instrumentation; for theinitial cases, this requires an experienced surgeon scrubbedup and actively assisting through the observer scope.Furthermore, all complications in a training situation must bemanaged in the best possible manner to minimize morbidityand maximize acceptable outcomes. The student must betaught the management of complications. This too requiresan experienced surgeon assisting the student, using acceptedmodern instrumentation. Management of complicationsextends well into the postoperative period and mandatesroutine postoperative slit lamp and fundus examination. Suchroutine pre- and postoperative examinations, assistance duringsurgery and management of complications (and its teaching)did not exist in any of the departments.</p><p>The faculty in some departments indicated that students&#x02032;routinely&#x02032; used slit lamps, applanation tonometers, gonioscopesand indirect ophthalmoscopes. In all departments, however, theresidents told a different story. They were not allowed to useinstruments specifically provided for them, and some diagnosticinstruments were locked up to prevent access for anyone.They were not taught to perform routine comprehensive eyeexamination and did not manage cases either under supervisionor independently.</p><p>While not a part of the checklists, an important aspect ofmodern eye care is informed consent and patient participationin the treatment. This was not practiced in any department;unless it is part of patient care in teaching departments, studentsare unlikely to understand its importance and employ it inpractice. In a training department, this ethical aspect becomeseven more demanding. Ideally patients should be informed thatthey may be operated on by a trainee or at least be informed thatthey will not have the choice of surgeon. Research methodologyis another important component of postgraduate teaching,especially if we want to encourage ophthalmic research in India.This was not formally taught in any program. The paucity ofpublications from most medical college departments wouldseem to be a direct consequence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></p><p>The reasons for lack of appropriate teaching and eye careare complex. One reason could be issues with the training oftrainers and is discussed below. Another cause could be thelimited working hours. The usually large patient loads cannotbe appropriately managed and teaching undertaken in a 5-hourday. The issues of private practice and nonpracticing allowanceresponsible for such limited working hours need urgentresolution. On the other hand, an increase in working hoursmay not guarantee that desired benchmarks will be achieved.(There are states where the working hours are longer but thepatient care and practice is similar.) Another unlikely, purelytheoretical possibility is poor leadership, improper attitudeand lack of accountability. Measures to identify and addressthe source of the problem and ensure appropriate teaching andpreferred practice are urgently needed.</p><p>As far as modern ophthalmology is concerned, the existingarchaic guidelines for the recognition and continued accreditationof teaching departments need major restructuring. Programswithout the necessary instrumentation, teaching and practicerequired for modern ophthalmology are &#x02032;recognized&#x02032; for training.On the other hand, we are aware of one well-functioningmodern teaching department (fulfilling all the benchmarks)that was not &#x02032;recognized&#x02032; as it was not split into &#x02032;units&#x02032; andhad &#x02032;too many beds.&#x02032; It would seem that the rules require unitsand beds, not instrumentation, teaching or preferred practicepatterns. Interestingly, while modern ophthalmology hardlyrequires &#x02032;beds&#x02032;, provision of such beds in teaching departmentsmay actually be desirable. Postgraduates could then at least beresponsible for the care of patients on their beds; if undertakenand supervised properly, the work-up, investigations andintervention on their &#x02032;own&#x02032; patients is one way to ensureexamination, management and follow-up skills. To ensuremodern requirements, the final postgraduate examination tocertify ophthalmologists too needs major change. The clinicalcomponent of the examinations should at least observe andtest competence in the components of a comprehensive eyeexamination and clinical (including surgical) ability, not justtheoretical knowledge as is currently the case.</p><p>The TOT became accepted terminology during the &#x02032;WorldBank&#x02032;-funded program. During the planning of this program,Indian experts had stressed the need for placement of qualitytraining equipment in the parent department <italic>before</italic> the TOTreturned. They also expressed concern about maintenance ofequipment and the potential for transfers of the TOT before theobjective of the program was achieved. In reality, the promisedequipment for training was not available on return in any ofthe parent departments. A TOT who was waiting for 6 monthsfor the basic equipment dourly expressed the need for a&#x02032;refresher&#x02032; course. TOT was to be the backbone of the moderntraining process; yet their training too was below par. A &#x02032;notouch&#x02032; technique was not taught to any of them. This techniqueis desirable in all cataract surgery but becomes especiallyimportant in less-than-ideal conditions, especially where glovesare not used: the existing situation in all departments. Andonce in their parent departments, the TOTs did not or couldnot function to the desired potential.</p><p>The report generated at the end of the first evaluationrecommended the provision of quality teaching instruments inall medical college departments, as well as measures to improvetraining and care delivery. The crucial aspect of maintenanceand budget for spare parts was highlighted. The issues facedby the TOTs were specially highlighted with possible solutions.To the best of our knowledge, this report was available toall policy makers. The lessons of the World Bank programnotwithstanding, the condition remained the same after the nextround of funding. Expensive new instrumentation, includingfield analyzers, lasers, fundus cameras and phacoemulsificationmachines, lay unused even a year after it had been provided.Lack of training was again one factor mentioned by thoseinterviewed. Further training may indeed be needed; however,even those who were trained did not transfer their skills toothers in the department or their students. Modern proceduresperformed in private practice were neither undertaken nortaught in the teaching department. The use of beam splitters inmicroscopes usually warrants no extra training. Other reasonscited included fear of spoiling the new instruments, lack ofspares and maintenance support. The practice of trained staffbeing deputed out to unrelated departments too continuedover the years.</p><p>The study has several limitations. The second evaluationwas not part of the original plan but serendipitously providedfollow-up information. While the same evaluator would havebeen desirable for both assessments, logistical and otherconstraints mandated another assessor. Although the formatand benchmarks used were the same for visits, the methods didvary and precluded some comparisons. We felt that the use ofchecklists helped avoid potential bias.</p><p>We assumed that half of the Rs. 56 crores allotted to the stateby the World Bank was used for instrumentation and training.The actual amount might have been less than this. We acceptthat the first estimate may be wrong (in either direction) buthighlight that an outlay was provided for instrumentationand training on two temporally separated occasions and havereported the impact of that investment on teaching and care.</p><p>The study state was chosen for convenience, logistics andbecause it was a beneficiary of World Bank and other funding.It is however a &#x02032;representative&#x02032; state of the country, and wefeel that the data can be extrapolated to most medical collegeteaching departments. The standards in the country do varydramatically, and there are some departments that not onlymeet but also exceed the benchmarks.</p><p>Some may consider the quality benchmarks as too strictfor a &#x02032;developing&#x02032; country. We feel that this pretext hasbeen used to maintain status quo for too long. We arguethat at least in departments responsible for the training offuture ophthalmologists, this overused &#x02032;developing country&#x02032;justification is no longer valid. The benchmarks used are notunrealistic; they have been achieved in the country and areeminently desirable.</p><p>In conclusion, the postgraduate programs do not trainresidents in modern ophthalmic examination and surgicaltechniques. The residents were not taught current cataractsurgical techniques and were not confident of independentpractice. The quality of care in the teaching departments didnot conform to accepted preferred practice patterns. Finally,two rounds of funding totaling about Rs. 34 crores towardsmodern instrumentation and training did not materially changethe standard of training and care.</p><p>The state of affairs has been an open secret for a long time.While there may be denials, accusations, recriminations andinaction, we hope that publication in our journal will helpthe ophthalmic community to acknowledge the problems,encourage dialog and initiate changes that ophthalmologytraining in India so obviously and desperately needs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Source of Support:
