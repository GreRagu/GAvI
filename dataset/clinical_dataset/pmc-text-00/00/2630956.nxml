In our previous studies, we discovered IBs containing a high percentage of correctly folded protein that can be extracted under non-denaturing conditions in biologically active form without applying any renaturation steps. In order to widen the concept of correctly folded protein inside IBs, G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) and three additional proteins were chosen for this study: GFP (Green fluorescent protein), His7dN6TNF-&#x003b1; (Truncated form of Tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; with an N-terminal histidine tag) and dN19 LT-&#x003b1; (Truncated form of Lymphotoxin &#x003b1;).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four structurally different proteins that accumulate in the bacterial cell in the form of IBs were studied, revealing that distribution of each target protein between the soluble fraction (cytoplasm) and insoluble fraction (IBs) depends on the nature of the target protein.</p><p>Irrespective of the folding pattern of each protein, spectroscopy studies have shown that proteins in IBs exhibit similar structural characteristics to the biologically active pure protein when produced at low temperature. In the case of the three studied proteins, G-CSF, His7&#x00394;N6TNF-&#x003b1;, and GFP, a significant amount of protein could be extracted from IBs with 0.2% N-lauroyl sarcosine (NLS) and the proteins retained biological activity although no renaturation procedure was applied.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that the presence of biologically active proteins inside IBs is more general than usually believed. A large amount of properly folded protein is trapped inside IBs prepared at lower temperatures. This protein can be released from IBs with mild detergents under non-denaturing conditions. Therefore, the active protein can be obtained from such IBs without any renaturation procedure. This is of great importance for the biopharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, such IBs composed of active proteins could also be used as pure nanoparticles in diagnostics, as biocatalysts in enzymatic processes, or even as biopharmaceuticals.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) upon overexpression of heterologous proteins in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>(<italic>E. coli</italic>) is a common event. Because of the belief that IBs are intracellular deposits of misfolded, biologically inactive proteins, they have been considered to be a bottleneck in protein production. To avoid time consuming and often unfavorable renaturation procedures, a lot of effort has been made to produce soluble proteins in bacteria either by altering the production process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], by co-expression of chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or by altering the target protein (point mutations, fusion proteins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the last few years, the view of inclusion bodies has been changing. The first observations of enzymatic activity in proteins inside IBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] were reported more than 15 years ago, but the phenomenon was not further explored and the usefulness and biotechnological importance were not recognized. Recently, several groups have reported the presence of biologically active proteins inside IBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The presence of residual native-like structures detected by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy has been reported by several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies in our laboratory revealed an interesting type of inclusion bodies containing a high percentage of correctly folded protein precursor trapped inside (non-classical IBs &#x02013; ncIBs). For fermenter cultivation, Jevsevar at al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] reported more than 40% activity of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) extracted from ncIBs under non-denaturing conditions, whereas in the shake flask culture the percentage of biologically active G-CSF was even higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore the research was expanded to other structurally unrelated proteins that all form inclusion bodies upon overexpression in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In addition to human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), green fluorescent protein (GFP), N-truncated form of tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; bearing an N-terminal histidine tag (His7&#x00394;N6TNF-&#x003b1;), and N-truncated form of Lymphotoxin &#x003b1; (&#x00394;N19LT-&#x003b1;) were studied.</p><p>As was previously already reported for diverse proteins by several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] we also demonstrate that the production of IBs at low temperature results in a higher amount of correctly folded proteins trapped inside IBs. This work is aimed at exploring whether the amount of correctly folded protein trapped in IBs is protein specific. Increased solubility in low concentration detergents was also studied. Solubility of inclusion bodies in mild detergents under non-denaturing conditions enables the extraction of the target protein in biologically active form without any denaturation and renaturation process. This is an interesting, and for downstream processes very important, property.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>Recombinant <italic>E. coli </italic>production strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was used in this study along with expression plasmids pET3a, pET19b (Novagen), and pQT2 (Qiagen) coding four structurally different proteins.</p><p>Details about the production of the BL21(DE3) [pET3a/P-Fopt5] strain for G-CSF production were described by Jevsevar et al.

Washed IBs, as well as ammonium sulfate precipitates, were dried in a Savant DNA Speed-Vac system for one-hour prior to analysis to reduce water interference in the infrared spectra. The infrared spectra of protein samples were recorded on a Bruker IFS66S spectrometer equipped with liquid nitrogen cooled MTC detector and Golden-Gate ATR diamond cell. The infrared spectra were used mainly for monitoring the deviations in structures of proteins prepared at different temperatures with respect to properly folded ones. Therefore, the effects of reflection were neglected and the ATR spectra were used as recorded with no additional corrections. Typically, 64 scans were averaged at a resolution of 4 cm<sup>-1 </sup>and apodized with a triangular function. Solvent spectra were recorded and subtracted before the examination of the amide I bands. The structures of the amide I and amide II regions were analyzed by second derivatives and Fourier deconvolution. The derivative spectra were smoothed by the Savitzky_Golay algorithm applying the 3<sup>rd </sup>polynomial and 15 smoothing points and normalized on the Tyrosine band near 1517 cm<sup>-1</sup>.

Slightly less protein can be extracted from GFP IBs and His7dN6 TNF-&#x003b1; IBs (80 &#x02013; 85%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). These proteins, easily extractable from ncIBs, contain a higher percentage of correctly folded protein inside IBs (based on spectroscopy analysis). This supports the hypothesis suggested by Jevsevar at. al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] that the more alike the inner structure of the IBs are the easier it is to extract the correctly folded protein from IBs.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins extracted from IBs with 0.2% N-lauroyl sarcosine</bold>.

As can be seen from the infrared studies, the percentage of unordered structures inside &#x00394;N19LT-&#x003b1; IBs is very high (even those formed at 25&#x000b0;C) and this could explain the poor extractability of &#x00394;N19LT-&#x003b1; from such IBs.</p><p>In all cases, IBs prepared at higher temperatures (37&#x000b0;C, 42&#x000b0;C) are less soluble in 0.2% N-lauroyl sarcosine. The lower solubility of IBs prepared at higher temperatures is not surprising as IBs have been generally reported to be insoluble in mild detergents. This is probably due to the high percentage of unordered protein structures in the IBs that was also confirmed by spectroscopy analysis.</p><p>Extractability of properly folded proteins from IBs in mild detergents is a very interesting property. IBs are predominantly composed of the target protein. During protein extraction in mild, non-denaturing conditions mainly properly folded proteins are extracted. We might thus speculate that during such extraction the target protein is further enriched and therefore less downstream steps are necessary to purify the protein. This hypothesis was confirmed during the preparation of the process for purification of G-CSF, where, in a single chromatography step, the production of a biologically active G-CSF with a purity greater than 95% was achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The same was also achieved for the isolation of pure, biologically active, fluorescent GFP and His7dN6 TNF-&#x003b1; (unpublished results).</p><p>Here some interesting questions arise, such as whether the IBs of other proteins produced at low temperatures are also in the form of more soluble material containing easily extractable, correctly folded proteins. Since IBs usually represent a highly concentrated pool of the target protein, it is worth exploring the industrial potential of easily soluble IBs, especially those containing large amounts of biologically active protein, in order to reduce production costs and to develop environmentally less harmful technologies. Such IBs composed of pure protein could also be used as active nanoparticles in diagnostics or as biocatalysts in enzymatic processes or even as biopharmaceuticals.</p></sec><sec><title>Biological activity</title><p>The specific biological activity of the protein was measured in two distinctive fractions: soluble protein produced in the cytoplasm (SN1) and insoluble protein, solubilized from IBs under mild non-denaturing conditions in 0.2% N-lauroyl sarcosine (SN2). Biological activity was measured for all four studied proteins.</p><p>Almost 50% of G-CSF extracted from the IBs shows specific biological activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Since the majority of the expressed G-CSF is in the form of IBs (98%), this represents almost all the biologically active protein produced in the cell. From the remaining 2% of total GCSF, which is produced in the cytoplasm, only 30% is in active form, representing less than 1% of the total G-CSF (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Distribution of target protein between the soluble fraction (cytoplasm) and insoluble fraction (IBs) is presented on pie diagrams.

As previously reported by Garcia-Fruitos at al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], GFP inside the IBs can be highly fluorescent. Our results show that 6% of all GFP in IBs is in the active, fluorescent form. Although the amount of active, fluorescent GFP in the cytoplasm is higher (about 30%), the protein is predominantly produced in the insoluble fraction (77%). Therefore, the share of the total GFP produced in the cell is almost equally distributed between the soluble and insoluble fraction (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Based on the spectroscopy analysis, we believe that the amount of correctly folded protein inside IBs is even higher, but not all the correctly folded protein is oxidized. Consequently not all the correctly folded protein is fluorescent.</p><p>As in the case of GFP, around 5% of His7&#x00394;N6 TNF-&#x003b1; extracted from IBs is in biologically active form. Since 40% of the protein is produced inside IBs, this represents 2% of the total His7&#x00394;N6 TNF-&#x003b1; produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Protein produced in the cytoplasm shows much higher biological activity (around 60%) and this corresponds to 36% of the total His7&#x00394;N6 TNF-&#x003b1; produced in the cell. Therefore we can conclude that correctly folded His7&#x00394;N6 TNF-&#x003b1; is predominantly produced in the soluble fraction (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><p>The specific biological activity of total &#x00394;N19LT-&#x003b1; produced in bacterial cells is less than half the percentage of that expected. The protein is mainly produced in the form of IBs inside bacterial cells (91%). Since only 0.1% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) of the protein extracted from IBs is biologically active, we may conclude that IBs of dN19LT-&#x003b1;, even when produced at 25&#x000b0;C, show typical characteristics of classical inclusion bodies containing essentially denatured and almost completely biologically inactive protein. The results were also confirmed by infrared spectroscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), which revealed a high percentage of unordered structure in &#x00394;N19 LT-&#x003b1; IBs produced at low temperature. Some specific biological activity was measured in the soluble protein fraction (3%), but even there the amount of properly folded protein is very small.</p><p>Based on the results presented above, the properly folded active protein can be produced inside the soluble (cytoplasm) and insoluble (IBs) cell fraction. The amount of properly folded protein inside individual cell fractions depends very much on the protein.</p><p>In the case of G-CSF, the active protein was predominantly produced inside the IBs. In addition, the amount of active protein inside GFP and His7&#x00394;N6 TNF-&#x003b1; IBs was significant and IBs could be used the source for the extraction of active protein. In the case of N19 LT-&#x003b1;, the amount of properly folded protein inside IBs was trivial. Therefore we can conclude that three of the four studied proteins form IBs composed of a significant amount of properly folded biologically active protein. As mentioned in a previous section, such IBs containing active proteins are very interesting for research and medical purposes, as well as for industrial use.</p><p>Once again it has to be stressed that specific biological activity data discussed above were obtained for IBs prepared at 25&#x000b0;C. When produced at higher temperatures (37&#x000b0;C, 42&#x000b0;C), all the proteins showed almost no biological activity. The same results were also obtained by infrared spectroscopy, where spectra of IBs produced at low temperatures were very similar to the spectra of the pure proteins, whereas IBs produced at higher temperatures contain a high proportion of unordered structures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In all cases studied so far, it was found that various amounts of correctly folded proteins were trapped inside inclusion bodies. The amount of correctly folded proteins and the solubility of the inclusion bodies mainly depend on the nature of the target protein, as well as on the growth conditions, such as the temperature and induction regime. Infrared spectroscopy analysis shows the presence of correctly folded proteins inside IBs. However, it is not possible to predict the biological activity of the target protein from spectroscopy analysis of the secondary protein structure. Results show that even though spectroscopy analysis shows a relatively high proportion of correctly folded proteins inside IBs (in the case of GFP and His7&#x00394;N6 TNF-&#x003b1; at 37&#x000b0;C), very low solubility of IBs in 0.2% N-lauroyl sarcosine as well as almost no biological activity can also be observed.</p><p>In our future work, we plan to optimize important parameters for the biosynthesis of proteins in the form of inclusion bodies with the main goal of increasing the accumulation of active protein inside the inclusion bodies. This should enable efficient isolation of the active protein by gentle extraction under non-denaturing conditions or even allow the use of IBs as active nanoparticles.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>&#x00160;P designed and performed most of the experiments and prepared the manuscript as well as final data analysis and figures.
