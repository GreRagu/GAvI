Therefore, more powerful computational and experimental tools for analyzing ncRNAs need to be developed. To this end, we propose novel kernel functions, called <italic>base-pairing profile local alignment (BPLA) kernels</italic>, for analyzing functional ncRNA sequences using support vector machines (SVMs). We extend the local alignment kernels for amino acid sequences in order to handle RNA sequences by using STRAL's; scoring function, which takes into account sequence similarities as well as upstream and downstream base-pairing probabilities, thus enabling us to model secondary structures of RNA sequences. As a test of the performance of BPLA kernels, we applied our kernels to the problem of discriminating members of an RNA family from nonmembers using SVMs. The results indicated that the discrimination ability of our kernels is stronger than that of other existing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of our kernels to the problem of genome-wide search of snoRNA families in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> genome, and confirmed that the expression is valid in 14 out of 48 of our predicted candidates by using qRT-PCR. Finally, highly expressed six candidates were identified as the original target regions by DNA sequencing.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Postgenomic transcriptome analysis has revealed the existence of a large number of transcripts which lack protein-coding potential, called noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), and has shown that only 2 % of the human genome encodes protein-coding RNAs, while 60&#x02013;70 % of the remainder is transcribed into ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Hence, despite the accumulating research on ncRNAs, it is likely that we are seeing only the tip of the iceberg regarding our understanding of the functions and the regulatory roles served by ncRNAs in cellular metabolism, pathogenesis and host-pathogen interactions.</p><p>Several computational methods based on stochastic context-free grammars have been developed for modeling and analyzing functional RNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7">2&#x02013;7</xref>). These grammatical methods have succeeded in modeling typical secondary structures of RNAs, and are commonly used for structural alignment of RNA sequences. However, such stochastic models are not capable of discriminating the member sequences of RNA families from nonmembers with sufficiently high accuracy to detect nRNA regions in genome sequences.</p><p>Recently, following the genome sequencing of various species, several computational methods based on the comparative approach have been developed for finding ncRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>). Rivas and Eddy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) have developed QRNA, which can classify a given pairwise alignment as one of three models using SCFGs: the coding model (COD), in which substitutions between synonymous codons occur frequently as a means of conserving amino acid sequences, the non-coding model (RNA), in which covariances of base pairs occur frequently in order to conserve secondary structures, and others (OTH). In addition, Pedersen <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) have developed EvoFold on the basis of phylogenetic SCFGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), which assumes that any mutations on each column of a given multiple alignment occur under a given phylogenetic tree of sequences, and mutations in unpaired bases occur more frequently than those in base pairs in conserved secondary structures. These assumptions improve the accuracy of predicting secondary structures and provide the capability of predicting structurally conserved regions from multiple alignments on the basis of phylogenetic information. Furthermore, Washietl <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) have developed RNAz, which detects structurally conserved regions from multiple alignments using support vector machines (SVMs). RNAz employs the averaged <italic>z</italic>-score of the minimum free energy (MFE) for each sequence and the structure conservation index (SCI). Assuming that the MFE for the common secondary structure is close to that for each sequence if a given multiple alignment is structurally conserved, SCI is defined as the ratio of the MFE for the common secondary structure to the averaged MFE for each sequence. The MFE for each sequence and the common secondary structure are calculated by RNAfold and RNAalifold in the Vienna RNA package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). These comparative methods have succeeded in detecting many structurally conserved noncoding regions. However, the structural conservation criterion failed to detect some families, such as H/ACA and C/D snoRNAs.</p><p>Contrary to the aforementioned methods, several works have been developed with an emphasis on certain families, such as snoRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14 B15">11&#x02013;15</xref>) and miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19">16&#x02013;19</xref>). SnoRNA finders based on pattern recognition algorithms, such as Snoscan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) for C/D snoRNAs as well as SnoGPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and the MEF-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) for H/ACA snoRNAs, can identify snoRNAs using target site information about rRNA modifications including 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-ribose methylation or pseudouridylation in the posttranscriptional process. Therefore, these methods can screen only guide snoRNAs which modify known targets. A successor package called SnoSeeker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) has been designed for the detection of not only guide snoRNAs, but also of orphan snoRNAs whose targets are unknown, and has been successfully applied to the human genome. Furthermore, an SVM-based snoRNA finder called SnoReport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) uses several features tailored specifically for snoRNAs, such as constraint MFEs under typical secondary structures of snoRNAs and the match scores of the box motifs of snoRNAs, and it does not require target site information about rRNA modifications.</p><p>On the other hand, SVMs and other kernel methods are being actively studied, and have been proposed for solving various problems in many research fields, including bioinformatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). These methods are more robust than other existing methods. For example, Saigo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) have proposed local alignment kernels for amino acid sequences, and their kernels with SVMs have outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks for remote homology detection of amino acid sequences. Therefore, we considered using kernel methods, including SVMs, for the analysis of functional ncRNAs.</p><p>For the purpose of analyzing ncRNAs using kernel methods, including SVMs, we have already proposed <italic>stem kernels</italic>, which extend the concept of string kernels to allow measurement of the similarities between two RNA sequences from the viewpoint of secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The feature space of the stem kernels is defined by enumerating all possible common base pairs and stem structures of arbitrary lengths. However, since the computational time and the memory footprint of stem kernels are of the order of <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><sup>4</sup>), where <italic>n</italic> is the length of the inputted RNA sequence, applying stem kernels directly to large data sets of ncRNAs is impractical.</p><p>Therefore, we propose novel kernel functions, called <italic>base-pairing profile local alignment (BPLA) kernels</italic>, for discrimination and detection of functional RNA sequences using SVMs. We extend the concept of local alignment kernels in such a way that it can handle RNA sequences using STRAL's; scoring function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The local alignment kernels measure the similarity between two sequences by summing the scores over all possible local alignments with gaps. STRAL's; scoring function takes into account sequence similarities as well as upstream and downstream base-pairing probabilities, which enables us to model secondary structures of RNA sequences. Note that unlike SnoReport, BPLA kernels do not depend on any family-specific features.</p><p>In order to test the performance of our kernels, we applied them to the problem of discriminating members of an RNA family from nonmembers using SVMs. The results indicated that the discrimination ability of our kernel functions is stronger than that of existing methods. Furthermore, we performed several experiments regarding the prediction of functional RNA regions using SVMs together with our kernel functions. The experimental results showed that our kernel functions enable us to efficiently discern individual RNA families within genome sequences. Finally, in order to confirm their performance for practical use, we used the proposed kernels in implementing a search for snoRNA families in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> genome, which has been studied extensively by computational and expression analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26 B27">24&#x02013;27</xref>). Our prediction was tested by qRT-PCR, and the verified snoRNA candidates were further confirmed by DNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Local alignment kernels for amino acid sequences</title><p>Before proposing our new kernels, we briefly describe the concept of local alignment kernels, which has been proposed by Saigo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). A local alignment kernel is a kind of string kernel which can calculate the similarity between a pair of sequences.</p><p>Let &#x003a3; be a finite set of symbols (| &#x003a3; | = 20 for amino acid sequences, or | &#x003a3; |=4 for nucleotide sequences).

Let | <bold>x</bold> | be the length of <bold>x</bold>.</p><p>A local alignment kernel between a pair of sequences <bold>x</bold> and <bold>y</bold> is defined by decomposing them into simple pieces and convoluting them. Given two string kernels <italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>2</sub>, we can define a convolution kernel <italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub> * <italic>K</italic><sub>2</sub> as follows: <disp-formula id="M1"><label>1</label><graphic xlink:href="gkn1054m1"/></disp-formula>If both <italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>2</sub> are valid kernels, <italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub> * <italic>K</italic><sub>2</sub> is also a valid kernel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>Three atomic string kernels are defined as follows.

Miyazawa <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) pioneered the use of the partition function for a reliable sequence alignment, which is known as a centroid estimator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). M&#x000fc;ckstein <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) employed the partition function for stochastic pairwise alignments by which suboptimal alignments can be drawn from an ensemble of all possible alignments of two sequences. The partition function plays a crucial role in the reliability of these methods as well as the local alignment kernel.</p></sec><sec><title>BPLA kernels for ncRNAs</title><p>Here, we propose new kernels for ncRNA sequences which take into account secondary structures by utilizing STRAL's; scoring function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Local alignment kernels can calculate the similarity between a pair of sequences by taking into account only sequence homology. However, it is well known that ncRNAs form secondary structures with important functions. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the secondary structures of RNAs in order to compare two RNA sequences.</p><p>Let us introduce a certain kind of secondary structure information into the match scores of local alignments. For each sequence, we first calculate a base-pairing probability matrix using the McCaskill algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The base-pairing probability matrix for a sequence <bold>x</bold> consists of the base-pairing probabilities <italic>P</italic><italic><sub>ij</sub></italic> that the <italic>i</italic>-th and the <italic>j</italic>-th nucleotides form a base pair, which is defined as: <disp-formula id="M9"><label>9</label><graphic xlink:href="gkn1054m9"/></disp-formula>where &#x1d4b4;(<bold>x</bold>) is an ensemble of all possible secondary structures of <bold>x</bold>, <italic>p</italic>(<italic>y</italic>|<bold>x</bold>) is the posterior probability of a secondary structure <italic>y</italic> given <bold>x</bold>, and <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>(<italic>y</italic>) is an indicator function, which equals 1 if the <italic>i</italic>-th and the <italic>j</italic>-th nucleotides form a base pair in <italic>y</italic> and 0 otherwise. In this study, we employ the Vienna RNA package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) for computing the expected counts (equation 9) using the McCaskill algorithm.</p><p>Subsequently, for each position <italic>i</italic>, we categorize the base-pairing probabilities into three kinds of sums: the probability <italic>P</italic><sup>left</sup><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = &#x02211;<sub>j &#x0003e; i</sub><italic>P</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> that a pair is formed with one of the downstream nucleotides, the probability <italic>P</italic><sup>right</sup><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = &#x02211;<sub>j &#x0003c; i</sub><italic>P<sub>ji</sub></italic> that a pair is formed with one of the upstream nucleotides, and the probability <italic>P</italic><sup>unpair</sup><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = 1&#x02212; (<italic>P</italic><sup>left</sup><sup>i</sup> + <italic>P</italic><sup>right</sup><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) that the nucleotide is unpaired. A probability distribution consisting of these three probabilities is called a <italic>base-pairing profile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>In this case, in accordance with STRAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), the match score between two nucleotides <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>x<sub>j</sub></italic> is defined using base-pairing profiles as follows: <disp-formula id="M10"><label>10</label><graphic xlink:href="gkn1054m10"/></disp-formula>where &#x003b1; is a weight parameter for structural information, and <italic>d</italic>: &#x003a3;<sup>2</sup> &#x02192; &#x0211d; is a substitution scoring function between two nucleotides. The first term of (equation 10) measures the structural similarity between <bold>x</bold> and <bold>y</bold> by taking the inner product of the base-pairing profiles, and the second term captures the sequence-level homology as well as the standard local alignment kernels. If <italic>d</italic> is positive semi-definite, (Equation 10) is obviously also positive semi-definite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). We use a modified RIBOSUM 85-60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) as the substitution matrix <italic>d</italic>. Since the original RIBOSUM 85-60 cannot satisfy the condition of positive semi-definiteness, we subtract the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix from each of its diagonal elements in order to transform the matrix into a positive semi-definite one. Therefore, we can employ <italic>s</italic> as the match scores for the local alignment kernels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). We call this <italic>the BPLA kernel</italic>. The computational complexity of the base-pairing probability matrices is of the order of <italic>O</italic>(|<bold>x</bold>|<sup>3</sup> + |<bold>y</bold>|<sup>3</sup>) with respect to time and <italic>O</italic>(|<bold>x</bold>}|<sup>2</sup> + |<bold>y</bold>|<sup>2</sup>) with respect to memory, and calculating the kernel value shows a complexity of the order of <italic>O</italic>(|<bold>x</bold>||<bold>y</bold>|) for both time and memory.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental verification by qRT-PCR</title><p>Expression analysis by qRT-PCR was performed in order to verify the validity of our snoRNA candidates predicted in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome. The reason for the choice of qRT-PCR was that high throughput of the method enabled to analyze the expression level of our candidate in the relatively large scale compared with the other methods such as northern blotting.</p><p> Total RNA was extracted from mixed developmental stages of <italic>C. elegans</italic> using RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion). In order to remove genomic DNA contaminants, the total RNA was treated with 6 U of DNase I for an hour which is more thorough than 2 U for 30 min in the manufacturer's; instruction. This substantially reduced the background noise of fluorescence intensities in RT-PCR especially at the later cycle phase and enabled us to determine the <italic>C</italic><sub>t</sub> values more accurately.</p><p>Templates for RT-PCR were produced by poly(A) tailing and oligo(dT) priming using Ncode miRNA First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's; protocol except that we did not use Universal qPCR Primer included in the kit. It might be confusing to readers that the name of this kit contains the word &#x02018;miRNA&#x02019; despite our experiments for verication of the snoRNA candidates. However, the kit does not include any miRNA-specific features in its principle and thus can be applied to any kind of small RNA families. The positive cDNA template, denoted by RT (+), was synthesized with the reverse transcriptase SuperScript III RT/RNaseOUT Enzyme Mix, and the negative control template, denoted by RT (&#x02212;), was prepared by adding DEPC-treated RNase-free water (Invitrogen) instead of the reverse transcriptase.</p><p> RT-PCR experiments were performed using StepOne Real-Time PCR System (ABI). The reaction was carried out in 20 &#x003bc;l with 1 &#x003bc;l of the template, 0.25 &#x003bc;M of the specific primer pair (see below) and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (ABI) at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min for 28 cycles followed by a melting curve analysis. The chart of fluorescence intensities was analyzed using the instrument's; system software v2.0 (ABI). We confirmed that amplification of RT (&#x02212;) was not detected for all the primer pairs. In the experiments of RT (+), every amplified candidate showed the specific PCR product indicated by the melting curve.</p><p> For each PCR target, a sequence-specific primer pair (forward and reverse) was designed using Primer3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and BLAST search against the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome. Primer3 was executed with the parameters recommended by Takara Bio which is more stringent than the default setting about base composition biases and self/pair complementarity that cause cross-hybridization and amplification of primer dimers. Amplification of nonspecific products was further tested by several times of preliminary experiments, and the primers were redesigned if needed. Since some of the targets were apparently difficult for designing good primers, we discarded such regions.

In practical situations, and in contrast to the above experiments, we usually extract fixed-length fragments from the target genomic sequences since the boundaries of RNA genes in genomic sequences are unknown. Therefore, it is important to confirm that the proposed kernels can also predict ncRNAs from such fragments in addition to entire sequences. We chose 24 ncRNA families from the Rfam database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). For each sequence, we produced a longer sequence by concatenating randomly generated subsequences with the same dinucleotide composition into its upstream and downstream, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Subsequently, we extracted fixed-length fragments from those sequences, where the window size of the fragments was 120 nt and sliding was 40 nt. These fragments include partial or complete ncRNA sequences. Negative examples were randomly generated by dinucleotide shuffling such that they do not include any ncRNA sequences. The parameters for the BPLA kernels were d=&#x02212;14, <italic>e</italic>=&#x02212;0.07, &#x003b1; = 7 and &#x003b2; = 0.07. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> shows that our kernels have sufficient ability to detect fragments containing ncRNAs as well as entire ncRNA sequences with known boundaries.<fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Generating a fragment data set.

First, we trained a support vector classifier for snoRNAs using known snoRNA sequences in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which are annotated in WormBase (Release WS182) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). We extracted positive fragments of known snoRNAs from the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome, where the window size of the fragments was 240 nt and the sliding was 40 nt. Negative fragments were randomly generated by dinucleotide shuffling. As a result, we trained the support vector classifier of snoRNAs with 128 positive fragments and 512 negative fragments. Subsequently, we extracted all fragments of the same window size from both strands of the entire genome of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which resulted in a total number of fragments of 5 014 018. For each fragment, the trained support vector classifier calculated an SVM class probability, which indicates the confidence regarding the affiliation of the fragment to a given snoRNA family. The time needed to scan all of the fragments was about a week on our Linux cluster comprising twenty 2.8 GHz dual-core AMD Opteron processors. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows the distribution of the SVM class probabilities for the known snoRNAs and the other fragments. It is clear that the distribution of known snoRNAs is biased towards high probability, which indicates that the trained classifier has strong ability to distinguish snoRNAs from other sequences. The list of snoRNA candidates predicted by our method with high probability is available as a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1054/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>.<fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Distribution of the SVM class probabilities for known snoRNAs and the rest of the fragments in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome calculated by the trained SVM classifier.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn1054f4"/></fig></p><p> In order to show that genome-wide search is a much more difficult task than the discrimination task on a well-established training set and the above result is only achieved by our BPLA kernels, we compared the ability of the genome search for snoRNA families with SnoReport. We performed the aforementioned procedure with SnoReport, instead of our kernels, only in the chromosome I, and calculated the SVM class probability distribution. Then, we evaluated the ability to distinguish snoRNAs from other fragments using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, in which positives are known snoRNAs, and negatives are the fragments from the genomic sequence. Only the fragments whose SVM class probability is above 0.5 were considered. As a result, the area under the ROC curve for our kernels was 0.873, whereas that for SnoReport was 0.686. This result indicates that even though the statistical method SVM is employed, the high performance cannot always be expected, and our well-designed BPLA kernels were proved to be essential to the genome-wide search task. Note that we cannot exclude the possibility that some of fragments used for negatives here may be unknown snoRNAs. Therefore, the scores in the analysis represent lower bounds of them.</p><p>One of our predicted fragments which has an SVM class probability above 0.99 overlaps with an EST and the <italic>C. briggsae</italic> alignment, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>.

By means of this threshold, we verified that 6 of the 48 candidates were in fact expressed as RNA genes.

Missal <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) predicted structurally conserved ncRNAs from the genomic alignment of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> using RNAz. He <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) detected the transcribed fragments, or &#x02018;transfrags&#x02019;, focusing on polyadenylated or non-polyadenylated fractions of the transcriptome with <italic>C. elegans</italic> whole-genome tiling microarrays. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> illustrates the overlap between RNAz, our candidates whose SVM class probabilities are above 0.9, and all types of transfrags. There are only 10 candidates predicted by both RNAz and our kernels, and this low incidence is attributable to the radically different features of the two methods. The SCI used in RNAz directly assesses the structure conservation in multiple alignments in order to detect unknown structured ncRNAs, while BPLA kernels evaluate the structural similarity between ncRNA sequences using base-pairing profiles. Furthermore, several works have reported that the ability of RNAz to detect snoRNA families is weaker than that for other ncRNA families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Therefore, it is very likely that RNAz predicted not only snoRNA-specific regions, but also structurally conserved regions which are not specific to snoRNAs, in the nematode alignment, whereas our kernels searched more precisely for snoRNA-like sequences in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome given the known snoRNAs.<fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Comparison of our candidates with those in previous studies (25,27) in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome.

This fact suggests that we cannot exclude the possibility that a part of the remaining &#x0003e; 40% of the predicted candidates of snoRNAs located in the regions without any transfrags might be confirmed by qRT-PCR.</p><p> The relatively low precision values 14/48 (<italic>C</italic><sub>t</sub> &#x0003c; 26.5) and 6/48 (<italic>C</italic><sub>t</sub> &#x0003c; 25.0), which are the rates of the reliable candidates verified by qRT-PCR expression analysis, do not represent the true statistical significance.

We can approximate that <italic>n</italic> &#x02248; 2700 because Deng <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) have revealed that the number of small noncoding transcripts in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome is at most 2 700, and <italic>N</italic> = 5 014 018 (the number of the fragments in the whole genome) &#x02212;1 720 000 (the roughly estimated number of the exonic fragments) &#x02248; 3 300 000. In accordance with this formulation, the <italic>P</italic>-value for 6/48, which corresponds to the probability to include six snoRNA coding regions among randomly selected 48 fragments from 3 300 000 fragments in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> whole genome, becomes 3.6e-12, and the <italic>P</italic>-value for 14/48 becomes 2.8e-32. These extremely small <italic>P</italic>-values indicate that six hits among 48 candidates selected from 3 300 000 fragments are not obtained just by chance and hence prove the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>The parameters <italic>d</italic>, <italic>e</italic>, &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; for the BPLA kernels are quite different from each of two cases: target sequences have flanking region or not. The optimal parameters for each case were calibrated by the grid search on all parameter combinations from selected search space for each parameter. However, this brute force approach should require huge computational time for large problems. Therefore, we are planning to implement an alternative approach, such as a gradient-based adaptation of parameters for given training data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1054/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) of Japan (Functional RNA Project); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Area &#x0201c;Comparative Genomics&#x0201d; No. 17018029) Funding for open access charge: Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Area &#x0201c;Comparative Genomics&#x0201d; No. 17018029).</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
