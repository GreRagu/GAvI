HNE-derived adducts have been implicated in many pathophysiological processes including atherosclerosis, diabetes, and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease. Tritium- and deuterium-labeled HNE (<italic>d</italic><sub>4</sub>-HNE) were used orthogonally to study adduction with proteins and individual nucleophilic groups of histidyl, lysyl, and cysteine residues. Using tritium-labeled HNE, we detected the binding of 486 molecules of HNE per low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle, significantly more than the total number of all reactive nucleophiles in the LDL particle. This suggests the formation of adducts that incorporate multiple molecules of HNE with some nucleophilic amino acid side chains. We also found that the reaction of a 1:1 mixture of <italic>d</italic><sub>4</sub>-HNE and <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub>-HNE with <italic>N</italic>-acetylhistidine, <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-Gly-Lys-OMe, or <italic>N</italic>-acetyl cysteine generates 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 adducts, which exhibit unique mass spectral signatures that aid in structural characterization. A domino-like reaction of initial 1:1 HNE Michael adducts of histidyl or lysyl nucleophiles with multiple additional HNE molecules forms 2:1 and 3:1 adducts that were structurally characterized by tandem mass spectrometry.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement><funding-source>National Institutes of Health, United States</funding-source></funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>tx8000303</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>tx-2008-000303</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phospholipids that incorporate arachadonic or linoleic acids have doubly allylic methylene groups that are highly susceptible to hydrogen atom abstraction followed by peroxidation leading to an array of reactive oxidation products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>).

Oxidation of lipids in low-density lipoproptein (LDL)<xref rid="fn3" ref-type="fn">1</xref> is thought to be the initial step in oxidative modification of LDL, which leads to the formation of foam cells and, consequently, atherogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Oxidative fragmentation of these polyunsaturated lipids can give rise to several cytotoxic products including several &#x003b3;-hydroxy-&#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-unsaturated aldehydes, which have been shown to be biologically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>) and can act as ligands for the CD36 receptors in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>).

Also, a previous model study detected the formation of adducts that incorporate two or more molecules of HNE per amine group, from the reaction of equimolar amounts of HNE and primary amines, even under high-dilution conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). However, structural characterization of all but a few adducts has been a challenge possibly due to their labile nature. Methods employed previously to identify HNE adducts of proteins or amino acids, using NaBH<sub>4</sub> reduction or modification by 3,5-dinitrophenylhydrazine, are harsh and may reflect only a fraction of the adducts formed. Because the detection and characterization of these adducts involved derivatization using strong reducing and/or acidic conditions, only adducts that are stable under these conditions have been detected. There is a need for mild techniques that are compatible with the products, which are stable under physiological conditions but which may readily decompose under harsher conditions. We now report the application of tandem mass spectrometry in conjunction with isotope labeling to probe the adduction chemistry of HNE with LDL and with amino acid residues and to identify the nature of adducts formed under physiomimetic conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>General Methods</title><p>Liquid scintillation counting was done on a Beckman LS 5801 counter with quench curves made from a Beckman <sup>3</sup>H standard set.

This is a prominent feature of these adducts. The intense peaks resulting from loss of water from the lysine Michael adducts contrast with the relatively minor peaks for dehydration of the Michael adducts of histidine. The &#x003f5;-amino group of the lysyl residue is expected to be protonated. Bridging of a proton from this nitrogen to a hydroxyl group can promote dehydration (see <xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Scheme S2 in the Supporting Information</xref>).

Lysine residues play a critical role in the function of apoB-100 and are the major targets of oxidative modifications. &#x0201c;Reactive&#x0201d; or available lysines in LDL are important for LDL binding to the LDL receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>) and the scavenger receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>) and for LDL modification. NMR spectroscopy of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled LDL was previously used to characterize the lysine residues in apoB-100. Reductive methylation with [<sup>13</sup>C]formaldehyde converts up to two-thirds of the total lysines to their dimethylamino derivatives. This corresponds to 225 reactive lysines per LDL particle, which includes 53 &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; lysines with p<italic>K</italic> 8.9 and 172 &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; lysines with p<italic>K</italic> 10.5 that are exposed on the surface of LDL. Another 132 lysines in the apoB-100 molecule are buried and unavailable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). The TNBS assay is widely employed to determine the number of &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; lysine residues in LDL. Thus, 317 &#x000b1; 29 reactive amino groups were detected in native LDL by TNBS assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>).</p><p>It must be recognized that the number of reactive amino groups in LDL determined by TNBS assay would also include EPs because they can also react rapidly with TNBS to form the trinitrophenyl-EP chromophore that has &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub> = 337 nm. TNBS has been widely used as a nonpenetrating chemical probe to identify amino phospholipids located on the external surface of cells because of its rapid covalent binding to phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). The time course of the reaction of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) with TNBS shows two plateaus: One occurs after 60&#x02212;90 min of incubation, and the other occurs at 15 h. It was presumed that TNBS reacts selectively with accessible lysine residues on the surface of HDL accounting for the first phase reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). The second phase of the TNBS reaction was presumed to involve less &#x0201c;reactive&#x0201d; amino residues in HDL. The reaction of TNBS with amino phospholipids arranged as a monolayer on the surface of the HDL reached a plateau in only 10&#x02212;20 min. There is no similar study on LDL. However, it is known that PE is depleted by 84% (determined by quantitative HPLC) in mildly oxidized LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). Clearly, the modification of EP significantly contributes to the total amino residue modification of LDL. There are as many as 80 EPs per LDL, mainly PE (40%) and plasmenyl ethanolamine (60%).</p><p>ApoB-100, the protein component of LDL, is a hydrophobic protein, consisting of a single large polypeptide chain of 4536 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 512 kDa. Unlike HSA, apoB-100 interacts with the phospholipid shell of LDL in such a way as to &#x0201c;organize&#x0201d; the surface monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). The lipid&#x02212;protein interaction might have important consequences for the oxidation and modification behavior of LDL, and the mechanism by which LDL is oxidized and modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>). Considering the total number of nucleophilic amino acid residues (350 Lys, 115 His, and 25 Cys) plus 80 EP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>) that might covalently react with HNE in LDL, the amount of HNE that can form adducts with LDL, for example, 486 molecules of per particle (Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), is very high. This finding supports the view that HNE modification of LDL is a complex process, involving not only nucleophilic amino acid residues but also EPs. Although it is generally known that lysine &#x003f5;-amino groups are major targets of HNE binding, it is also capable of modifying amino phospholipids in LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>). In fact, our TNBS studies of LDL primary amino group modification showed that only 165&#x02212;230 of total 350 lysines plus 80 EPs were modified. The high estimate agrees well with the 225 reactive lysines detected by reductive methylation. Uchida et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>) found that 50 histidines and 40 lysines were &#x0201c;lost&#x0201d; per LDL, determined by amino acid analysis after reductive stabilization of HNE adducts by treatment with NaBH<sub>4</sub> and protein hydrolysis with 6 N HCl, upon the incubation of LDL (1.0 g/mL) with HNE (1.0 mM) for 2 h at 37 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>). On the basis of these observations, it seems likely that most histidines would be modified upon treating LDL (0.5 mg/mL) with HNE (2 mM) for 48 h at 37 &#x000b0;C. Nevertheless, even assuming that all histidines and all cysteines are reactive, at least 41 of a total 486 HNE bound cannot be accounted for assuming only 1:1 adducts with all &#x0201c;reactive&#x0201d; lysyl residues, all EPs, histidine,and cysteine residues (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This suggests that some adducts can be generated that incorporate more than one HNE molecule. This conclusion is consistent with earlier model studies showing that the reaction of HNE with equimolar quantities of primary amines generates adducts that incorporate two (or more) equivalents of aldehyde per amine molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). However, it should be noted that the amounts of HNE used in these studies are not typical of the amounts that are generated in vivo.

In a model study, we detected and characterized the formation of 2:1 and 3:1 adducts of HNE with histidyl and lysyl nucleophiles using a 1:1 mixture of deuterium-labeled HNE and unlabeled HNE.

These multiple HNE adducts may rearrange to form other toxic products, or by corollary, this could be one of the in vivo homeostatic mechanisms to detoxify lipid oxidation products by effectively quenching HNE&#x02019;s reactivity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants HL53315 (R.G.S.), GM 21249 (R.G.S.), and EY 014239 (J.W.C.), a Foundation Fighting Blindness Research to Prevent Blindness Challenge Grant and Senior Investigator Award (J.W.C.), a Steinbach Award (J.W.C.), and an Ohio BRTT Award 05-29 (J.W.C. and R.G.S.).
