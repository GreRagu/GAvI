Innovative experimental approaches may now provide limited partial                    information about conformational changes along motion pathways of proteins.                    There is therefore a need for computational approaches that can efficiently                    incorporate prior information into motion prediction schemes. In this paper, we                    present <italic>PathRover,</italic> a general setup designed for the integration                    of prior information into the motion planning algorithm of rapidly exploring                    random trees (RRT). Each suggested motion pathway comprises a sequence of                    low-energy clash-free conformations that satisfy an arbitrary number of prior                    information constraints. These constraints can be derived from experimental data                    or from expert intuition about the motion. The incorporation of prior                    information is very straightforward and significantly narrows down the vast                    search in the typically high-dimensional conformational space, leading to                    dramatic reduction in running time. To allow the use of state-of-the-art energy                    functions and conformational sampling, we have integrated this framework into                    Rosetta, an accurate protocol for diverse types of structural modeling. The                    suggested framework can serve as an effective complementary tool for molecular                    dynamics, Normal Mode Analysis, and other prevalent techniques for predicting                    motion in proteins. We applied our framework to three different model systems.                    We show that a limited set of experimentally motivated constraints may                    effectively bias the simulations toward diverse predicates in an outright                    fashion, from distance constraints to enforcement of loop closure. In                    particular, our analysis sheds light on mechanisms of protein domain swapping                    and on the role of different residues in the motion.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Incorporating external knowledge into computational frameworks is a challenge of                    prime importance in many fields of biological research. In this study, we show                    how computational power can be harnessed to make use of limited external                    information and to more effectively simulate the molecular motion of proteins.                    While experimentally solved protein structures restrict our knowledge to static                    molecular &#x0201c;snapshots&#x0201d;, a vast number of proteins are                    flexible entities that constantly change shape. Protein motion is therefore                    intrinsically related to protein function. State-of-the-art experimental                    approaches are still limited in the information that they provide about protein                    motion. Therefore, we suggest here a very general computational framework that                    can take into account diverse external constraints and include experimental                    information or expert intuition. We explore in detail several biological systems                    of prime interest, including domain swapping and substrate binding, and show how                    limited partial information enhances the accuracy of predictions. Suggested                    motion pathways form detailed lab-testable hypotheses and can be of great                    interest to both experimentalists and theoreticians.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanistic understanding of protein motions intrigued structural biologists,                bio-informaticians and physicists to explore molecular motions for the last five                decades.

An                inherent flexibility is characteristic of fundamental protein functions such as                catalysis, signal transduction and allosteric regulation. Elucidating motion of                protein structures is essential for understanding their function, and in particular,                for understanding control mechanisms that prevent or allow protein motions.

A common practice in sampling methods of single conformations                    like MC is to bias the energy function itself towards known constraints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Torrie1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. In                    the context of sampling-based motion planning, it is common to explicitly bias                    the sampling to include the target conformation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Zucker1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Bekris1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>).                    Another common bias is towards narrow passages in the space of configurations                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-LaValle2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Barraquand1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to                    avoid getting stuck due to over-bias, biased sampling is often restricted to a                    fraction of the tree growth iterations.

PathRover                    generates low-energy, clash-free motion pathways that are biased towards                    external constraints. This is in analogy to similar approaches for finding a                    single optimal structure (but not a motion pathway) under a set of experimental                    constraints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-MartiRenom1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-deVries1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Our approach                    follows the notion that the combination of a number of partial constraints can                    significantly limit the number of feasible solutions. We rely on a generalized                    RRT formalism that allows efficient, flexible and straightforward integration of                    prior information into the basic RRT algorithm.

(A) The basic                            <italic>Single-RRT</italic> algorithm provides fast but rough coverage                            of unexplored regions, and the target is often missed (red star, top                            left). During the run, the tree grows in feasible space (white) among                            obstacles (orange rectangles). In biological examples, these obstacles                            are high-energy conformations. Each point stands for a two dimensional                            conformation, and the tree grows from a source conformation (violet                            star, middle of figure), towards random directions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>). (B) In the                                <italic>Partial-RRT</italic> variant, we use partial information to                            truncate branches that do not grow towards the target (like the                            truncated branch in the grey ellipse, compare to the branch in the                            magenta ellipse). The search is more confined to relevant regions, at                            the expense of overall coverage of the search space. (C, D) Comparison                            between the basic <italic>Single-RRT</italic> algorithm and RRT with                            partial information (<italic>Partial-RRT</italic>), for the toy example                            in <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>. The partial information                            used here is the distance to the target. In                            <italic>SingleRRT-t50</italic> and <italic>PartialRRT-t50</italic> the                            target is also used as an explicit direction of growth once in 50                            iterations, in case the tree reaches the proximity of the target but not                            its exact location. This test follows a common assumption that RRT                            running time is dominated by the number of collision tests. We compare                            the Euclidean distance of the RRT node that is closest to the target                            (y-axis) as a function of the number of collision tests (x-axis)                            throughout the run. Results are the average distance (in                            <italic>c</italic>) or the minimum distance (in <italic>d</italic>) over                            50 independent runs. PartialRRT performed better than SingleRRT,                            especially for a lower number of collision checks. Better performance is                            achieved in less running time. As the number of collision checks grows.                            All methods converge.

An automated, accurate choice of mobile                    <italic>dof</italic>s is a challenging aspect of motion prediction, and in this                    step, prior information can be most useful (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Kirillova1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> for an attempt                    in this direction). In this work, we have combined information from several                    sources for restricting the number of <italic>dof</italic>s, such as: (1)                    careful inspection of structures, (2) relevant literature, (3) computational                    tools for detecting hinge regions like Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Yang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, and                    (4) comparison of structural changes in alternative (native or homologue)                    conformations. When both a source conformation and a target conformation are                    available, we used the FlexProt flexible alignment tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Shatsky1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref> to extract fixed                    regions of the protein, and defined the <italic>dof</italic>s by the regions                    in-between. These were used to manually restrict the allowed                    <italic>dof</italic>s in the examined model systems (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000295-t002">Table 2</xref>).

The partial information                        predicates are used to choose a motion path that leads from the initial                        conformation to the conformation with the best predicate score.</p><p>The partial information bias is introduced by a filtering step. The filtering                        step is applied only in every other iteration, to allow an escape from local                        minima traps. In the filtering step, the branch that grows towards                            q<sub>rand</sub> is terminated if it does not improve the partial                        information predicate after <italic>m</italic> consecutive interpolation                        steps (typically <italic>m</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2,                        again to allow an escape from local minima traps). The branch is terminated                        even if it leads to energetically feasible conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000295-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). The aim of                        this filtering step is to avoid expensive energy calculations in undesired                        directions. We note that existing branches are not pruned, only the growth                        of the current branch is terminated.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>The effect of avoiding local minima with respect to partial information</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000295-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows a toy                        example where branch termination is applied in all iterations.

Even though the homologue was the reference for biasing the                                motion, the simulations reached the correct conformation with a                                better level of accuracy for several predicates.

Remarkably, in four cases,                        the final structure was more similar to the pseudo-monomer than to SigE,                        even though the reference for guiding the motion was SigE (the SigE monomer                        deviates by 3.96 &#x000c5; from the pseudo-monomer). This suggests that                        the energy function prevented over-bias of CesT motion towards the                        structural features of SigE. This fact is particularly surprising since the                        simulations were conducted in centroid mode, without the atomic details of                        the side-chains, and demonstrates the effectiveness of a simplified and                        rapid energy function in this case. At such level of predictive precision                        (&#x0003c;2 &#x000c5;), many side-chains can be already modeled quite                        accurately. Although our aim is motion prediction and not homology modeling,                        it is promising that the near-native conformation is recovered using very                        simple predicates.</p></sec><sec id="s3a4"><title>Relative orientation of secondary structures</title><p>In <italic>Sig-E</italic> and in the <italic>CesT</italic> pseudo-monomer                        (but not in the initial conformation), &#x003b1;-helices H1 and H3 each lie                        in a different domain of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000295-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). In addition, &#x003b2;-strand                        B0 of the N-terminal domain is paired to &#x003b2;-strand B1 of the                        C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000295-g002">Figure                        2b</xref>).

An interesting                        predicate is the Helix Line-Fit predicate, which combines three measures. We                        used least mean square line fitting (LMSLs, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000295-t001">Table 1</xref>) to approximate the main axes of                        &#x003b1;-helices H1 and H3. We then measured the distance and angle between                        the fitted lines, as well as the distances between the centers of mass of                        each helix. This is a useful measure when relying on a homologue protein,                        since it is much less sensitive to alignment shifts that are characteristic                        for &#x003b1;-helices. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000295-g003">Figure 3b</xref> we observe that the final conformation was very close                        to the native pseudo-monomer (1.87 &#x000c5;) but not to SigE, which is                        the reference for the biasing predicate. Looking closely at this example                            (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000295.s004">Table                            S1</xref>), we saw that the line angle and line distance predicates were                        perfectly matched to their values in <italic>SigE</italic>, whereas the                        center of mass distance between the helices did not reach its value in                            <italic>SigE (15 &#x000c5;)</italic> but rather reached its value in                        the CesT pseudo-monomer. Hence, the simulation was not over-biased by                        partial information constraints, and took into account the specific features                        of the simulated molecule.</p></sec><sec id="s3a5"><title>&#x003b2;-sheet formation</title><p>The combination of helix and sheet predicates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000295-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000295-g003">Figure 3</xref>) was sufficient to direct the                        motion to the native conformation.

In contrast, the helices did not move to the correct                        orientation when the only partial information provided was &#x003b2;-sheet                        formation.

It is clear that the distance between                        a single pair of atoms should be combined with other partial information or                        atomic detail constraints, in order to derive a more reliable target                        conformation and motion pathway. Therefore, we have examined what                        combination of distance constraints suffices for biasing the motion.                        Combinations of two or three distance constraints (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000295-t003">Table 3</xref>) were used to guide the motion.

We observe that 2 or 3 constraints are still not enough to guide the motion                        in all simulations, but they lead to a much higher percentage of runs that                        reach the native conformation.

Upon binding of the ligand in a cleft between the two domains, the domains                        approach each other to close the cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000295-g004">Figure 4a</xref>).

Consequently, the hinge torsion                        angles must change in a coordinated way, to prevent the two domains to                        disintegrate. Although violating the integrity of domains is energetically                        unfavorable, a lot of running time may be consumed on sampling non-favored                        conformations that disintegrate the domains.

This allows for the use of very general                features, whereas biased sampling may require <italic>ad-hoc</italic> computations                of a biased distribution functions that differ between various types of information.</p><p>We incorporated partial information into simulations of three different systems:                    <italic>CesT</italic> type III secretion chaperone, <italic>Ribose Binding                    Protein (RBP),</italic> and <italic>Cyanovirin-N</italic> anti-viral protein.                Our analysis demonstrates how partial information constraints limit the search in                the vast space of possible motion pathways. These constraints are motivated by                existing and novel experimental methods for measuring constraints over transient                conformations, or by expert intuition. In turn, computational observations allow for                further subsequent validation by introducing detailed predictions of the motion that                can be validated by experimental methods. We showed that the energy function                prevents an over-bias by the partial information constraints, in case our prior                information is inexact. PathRover simulations allowed us to assess the contribution                of different residues to motion. Apparently, modest motions in specific regions may                facilitate large-scale motions. The results from different simulations produced                consistent patterns, and may therefore justify partial restriction of motion to                improve running times. In particular, restricted and free simulations resulted in                similar patterns of motion.</p><p>An important aspect of PathRover is its full embedding into the Rosetta modeling                framework. Rosetta has repeatedly demonstrated an exceptional ability to produce                high-quality results for a variety of different modeling tasks in the field of                protein modeling, docking, protein design and other modeling challenges at                atomic-level detail (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Qian1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Dantas1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>). The incorporation                into Rosetta provides well-calibrated energy functions (both for centroid and                full-atom simulations), efficient energy calculations, and a battery of established                conformational sampling protocols. It also allows extension to additional predicates                of partial information that were previously implemented in Rosetta, such as NMR                coupling measurements and docking interface constraints. These have been used to                guide and filter Rosetta Monte-Carlo searches, and will here be incorporated into                RRT-based motion prediction.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>A Knowledge-Based Energy Function</title><p>Previous applications of the RRT algorithm have mainly been based on geometric                    considerations of clash avoidance or Van der Waals terms of established force                    fields. In some cases, more sophisticated terms were employed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Apaydin1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Amato2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we introduce                    the established Rosetta full-atom energy function into sampling based methods.                    Hence, we are able to generate motion pathways for complex movements that are at                    the same time energetically favorable and that abide by possibly known                    constraints about the motion. The full-atom energy function of Rosetta (we used                    here score12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Qian1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>) includes physical terms such as van der                    Waals potential and solvation terms, as well as statistical knowledge based                    terms like the Ramachandran score, rotamer likelihood, statistical hydrogen                    bonding term and a simplified electrostatic score <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Rohl1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. In some cases we                    observed that the repulsive energy term dominates the motion pathway: in a                    cluttered environment, clash avoidance is indeed probably the main contribution.                    Naturally, however, additional energy terms will affect the details of the                    motion pathways, such as solvation effects and electrostatic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Boas1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>. We                    note that the statistical terms in Rosetta have straightforward interpretation                    in terms of physical properties. For instance, the Ramachandran score and                    rotamer likelihoods reflect steric hindrance in disallowed regions. The hydrogen                    bonding term was also shown to correlate remarkably with quantum-mechanical                    calculation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Morozov1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. While the original Rosetta energy function                    was optimized for native conformations, we postulate that it can also be used                    for the generation of clash-free, reasonable motion paths, which also account                    for other physical principles. Comparison to other common force-fields like                    CHARMM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Brooks1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref> and Amber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Case1">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref> will provide                    additional credibility to PathRover simulations. In principle, PathRover is not                    restricted to any energy scoring function, as the energy scoring is a                    &#x0201c;black-box&#x0201d; in the implementation of the algorithm. As                    molecular mechanics energy functions are currently being added to the Rosetta                    modeling framework, we intend to compare different energy scoring functions in                    future work.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Future Applications</title><sec id="s4b1"><title>Experimental validation and analysis of simulations</title><p>One of the big challenges of computational biology is the interface between                        computational and experimental observations. While full-atom experimental                        motion pathways of high resolution are still not in sight, significant                        progress has been recently made in experimental research of transient                        conformations. Distance constraints from FRET experiments,                        Paramagnetic-Resonance Enhancement, Residual Dipolar Coupling and other                        spectroscopic methods for assessing molecular dynamics can be used for (1)                        constraining simulations of molecular motion using measurable constraints,                        and for (2) validating motion pathways of suggested simulations, by                        comparing the measured distance constraints to simulated predictions. Our                        vision is that innovative experimental measurements of limited scope can                        focus and enhance computational techniques, effectively allowing researchers                        to generate realistic motion pathways that incorporate as much external                        information as possible within the currently suggested framework of                        PathRover. Particularly, this can allow for the design of experiments that                        target specific states within a motion pathway based on in silico                        predictions of large-scale motions. The predicted motions can be also used                        to suggest mutations, such as our suggested mutations in L1 and W49 for                        Cyanovirin-N (see residues marked in red in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000295.s011">Videos                        S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000295.s012">S7</xref>).</p><p>Computational observations are most meaningful when they are well-defined in                        a way that poses them as clear, lab-testable hypotheses. To that end, it is                        not sufficient to rely on raw simulations results. In our work, we have                        therefore devoted significant effort for developing analysis and                        visualization tools for extracting physical features from simulated motion,                        including the protocol for analyzing hinge regions in simulated motion, as                        well as the visualization and space-time alignment of multiple motion paths.                        We believe that developing novel analysis and visualization tools is an                        important direction of future research, which is just as important as the                        simulations themselves, as it can provide the missing link between                        experimental and computational observations.</p></sec><sec id="s4b2"><title>Applications to other types of molecular motion</title><p>In this work PathRover was applied to motions of domain swapping and                        substrate binding. However, different types of molecular motions might have                        different characteristics with respect to the number of torsion angles that                        are involved in the motion, the scale of the motion, the role of                        side-chains, etc. One challenging class of molecular motions involves                        allosteric protein motions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000295-Daily1">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref>.

Another interesting type of motion involves more than one                        molecule, such as docking of a protein or a flexible peptide onto another                        protein.
