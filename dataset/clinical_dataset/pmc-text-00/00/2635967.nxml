In many insect species these bacteria induce a cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) between sperm of infected males and eggs of uninfected females. From an evolutionary point of view, CI is puzzling: In order to induce this modification-rescue system, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> affect sperm of infected males even though <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are only transmitted maternally. Phylogenetic studies of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and hosts show that the bacteria rarely cospeciate with their hosts, indicating that infections are lost in host species. However, the mechanisms leading to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> loss are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using a population genetic model, we investigate the spread of host mutants that enhance or repress <italic>Wolbachia</italic> action by affecting either bacterial transmission or the level of CI. We show that host mutants that decrease CI-levels in males (e.g. by reducing <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-density during spermatogenesis) spread, even at cost to mutant males. Increase of these mutants can lead to loss of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections, either as a direct consequence of their increase or in a step-wise manner, and we derive analytically a threshold penetrance above which a mutation's spread leads to extinction of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Selection on host modifiers is sexually antagonistic in that, conversely, host mutants that enhance <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in females are favoured whereas suppressors are not.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is likely to be lost from host populations on long evolutionary time scales due to reduction of CI levels in males. This can occur either by evolution of single host modifiers with large effects or through accumulation of several modifier alleles with small effects on <italic>Wolbachia</italic> action, even at cost to mutant males and even if infected hosts do not incur fecundity costs. This possibility is consistent with recent findings and may help to explain the apparent short evolutionary persistence times of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in many host systems.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> are intracellular bacteria that infect a wide variety of arthropod hosts. Screenings of single individuals per species typically give estimates of around 20&#x00025; infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Werren1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Werren2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, and a recent meta-analysis indicates that the global incidence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> among insect species can be as high as 65&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Hilgenboecker1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. As intracellular bacteria inhabiting the cytoplasm, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are transmitted vertically through female eggs and not through sperm, but can affect phenotypes in both males and females.</p><p>As part of their lifestyle as reproductive parasites, arthropod-<italic>Wolbachia</italic> show a wide array of strategies to manipulate hosts into producing higher proportions of infected female offspring. Infected females are favoured because this is the sex that transmits the bacteria to future generations through the egg cytoplasm, whereas <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are not transmitted through sperm. Mechanisms used by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> range from killing of male offspring or induction of parthenogenesis to more subtle manipulations such as generation of sperm-egg incompatibilities, called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Laven1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Werren4">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. CI is interpreted to involve a modification-rescue system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Werren3">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>: <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in infected males modify the sperm, and the same strain of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> must be present in the egg to rescue the modification, or the embryo will typically fail to complete development. Cytologically, CI is manifested as a delay in the nuclear envelope breakdown of the paternal nucleus which results in improper condensation of paternal chromatin in the embryo, typically leading to embryonic death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Tram1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Ferree1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The phylogenetic history of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> indicates that long-time phylogenetic concordance between arthropod hosts and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is uncommon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Werren1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Werren3">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Baldo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. However, such phylogenetic concordance would be expected due to the vertical transmission of these bacteria typically found within a species. Comparative phylogenetic analyses of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in nematodes do show concordance with host phylogeny indicative of long term maintenance of the bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Bandi1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Charlat1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, which contrasts with the pattern observed in arthropod-associated <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. However, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in nematodes are thought to be mutualistic, whereas those found in arthropods are primarily reproductive parasites (i.e. they manipulate reproduction of hosts to enhance their own persistence). Studies also reveal frequent horizontal transmission of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> between arthropod species on an evolutionary timescale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Werren1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Baldo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Baldo2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Zhou1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Comparing these patterns suggests that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are frequently acquired by arthropod species, but often do not persist within a species sufficiently long to co-diverge with the host (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Opijnen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> for an exception). There must thus be mechanisms of loss of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. However, unlike typical infections, resistance to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections in females is expected to be selected against, at least for the predominantly found phenotype of cytoplasmic incompatibility. The reason is that infected females are &#x0201c;addicted&#x0201d; to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> &#x02013; if they lose their parasites, they will be reproductively incompatible with infected males in the population. Therefore, mechanisms by which host species lose their <italic>Wolbachia</italic> despite these antagonistic selection pressures are still unclear, and the male-specific repression of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> that is presented here seems to be one theoretical possibility to solve this paradox.</p><p>Early studies on CI-systems elucidated the dynamics of CI-<italic>Wolbachia</italic> and the implications of maternal transmission and infected male incompatibility for the fitness of uninfected females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Caspari1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Fine1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous theoretical studies of the evolution of incompatibility-inducing systems and their dynamics have found selection among parasites and hosts to favor variants that increase the proportion of infected progeny, i.e. by increasing transmission rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Turelli1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Turelli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Turelli1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> also addressed possible &#x0201c;resistance&#x0201d; mechanisms in infected or uninfected females: Without assuming mutational costs and given imperfect transmission, he found the spread of modifier alleles reducing susceptibility of infected ova to sperm from infected males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Turelli1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In a similar spirit, previous studies on haplodiploids have examined the spread of costless modifier alleles that completely eliminate or moderately to greatly reduce CI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Vala1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Vavre2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, the latter focusing on the effect of different CI types on the spread of such mutations. The dynamics of costly modifier alleles reducing female susceptibility to modified sperm have been examined and suggested as a plausible mechanism to drive nuclear transgenes through insect populations by Sinkins and Godfray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Sinkins1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, a bacterial role in losing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> has been proposed where CI-levels are assumed to slowly degenerate through mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Hurst1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. CI-inducing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> could also be displaced by sex-ratio distorting mutants, but empirical and theoretical evidence supports this idea only for induction of parthenogenesis and not for male-killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Engelstdter1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Engelstdter2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there has not been a systematic investigation of the effects of male and female specific host modifiers on <italic>Wolbachia</italic> dynamics, particularly treatments that incorporate costs of modifying alleles and consider the consequences to persistence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections.</p><p>Here we investigate the co-dynamics of sex-specific host modifiers of CI-<italic>Wolbachia</italic> to determine whether their evolution can explain the lack of persistence of CI-<italic>Wolbachia</italic> in host species. Specifically, we investigate host modifiers that either (a) decrease or increase modification of sperm or (b) decrease or increase transmission of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> through eggs. Previous studies have either focused on &#x02013; for the case of male &#x0201c;resistance&#x0201d; &#x02013; the special case of complete elimination of CI through host modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Vala1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> or the special case of CI in haplodiploids (where CI can lead to male production) and the effect of different CI-types on the spread of CI-reducing mutations of moderate to large effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Vavre2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our study systematises these approaches but focuses on the long-term fate of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infections in the face of host modifier evolution. Moreover, we widen the scope by considering the entire range of putative modifications with relative effects varying from 0&#x00025; to 100&#x00025;, and we furthermore introduce survival costs incurred by mutant individuals in order to assess the effect of such costs on the fate of the mutation. We then apply analytical and numerical methods to examine how such regulatory mutants alter <italic>Wolbachia</italic> dynamics and investigate whether such mutations may also cause local extinctions of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. We find that mutations that decrease <italic>Wolbachia</italic> modification of sperm can often spread and go to fixation in single populations, thereby altering stable infection frequency equilibria or driving <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to extinction, even when elevated survival costs of the mutation are incurred. Moreover, we make explicit use of infection instability to deduce analytically the threshold in effect size above which the spread of a mutation leads to loss of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. We find that fixation of sub-threshold male-specific repressive mutations (that decrease CI-levels and lower <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-prevalence) eases the conditions for the spread of subsequent mutations of similar kind, so that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> may be lost by way of sequential host adaptation. Mutations that decrease <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transmission or rescue function are disadvantageous to females and never spread for moderate fecundity-costs, while, as expected, enhancing mutations increasing transmission rates are favoured. These modelling results are then discussed within the context of current theoretical, developmental, and evolutionary studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We investigated the evolution of host modifiers in a single panmictic host population infected with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> that induce cytoplasmic incompatibility. Modification of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> action by the host is controlled by one nuclear locus with two alleles, one being the wild-type, the other the mutation in question. Within the employed haploid model, individuals are characterized by their sex, their genotype at the modifier locus, and their cytoplasmic infection status with <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Consequently, eight resulting phenotypic classes of hosts are treated in the model. Host-modifier genes are generally assumed to segregate according to standard Mendelian laws. We consider the following classes of host modifiers: (a) enhancement or reduction of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> modification of sperm, (b) enhancement or reduction of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transmission to eggs, and (c) &#x0201c;mimicry&#x0201d; of egg rescue or sperm modification.</p><p>We follow Fine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Fine1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> in describing the infection dynamics of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> by two parameters: the transmission rate <italic>t</italic>, and the level of cytoplasmic incompatibility <italic>l</italic><sub>CI</sub>. The transmission rate is defined as the proportion of an infected female's gametes that contain <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. The level of cytoplasmic incompatibility refers to the non-developing proportion of zygotes that result from fusion of modified spermatozoids with uninfected oocytes. If transmission is complete then the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infection will go to fixation, if <italic>t</italic>&#x0003c;1, however, a threshold frequency will exist below which <italic>Wolbachia</italic> cannot invade. Additionally, we assume <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to inflict a fecundity cost on infected females which reduces their offspring number by a factor of 1&#x02212;<italic>f</italic>. To facilitate comparison with the work of Turelli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Turelli1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, our transmission rate <italic>t</italic> corresponds to his <italic>1-&#x003bc;</italic>, our level of CI <italic>l</italic><sub>CI</sub> to his <italic>1-H</italic> (or <italic>s<sub>h</sub></italic>), and our fecundity reduction in infected females <italic>f</italic> to his <italic>1-F</italic> (or <italic>s<sub>f</sub></italic>).</p><p>The mutations under consideration may be grouped according to their sex-specificity (i.e. male- or female-specific) and their effect on <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (i.e. repression or enhancement). Within each class mutations are thought to be sex-specific. Mutations repressing or enhancing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> action in males will alter the modification-function of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> accordingly, while in females such mutations may similarly alter <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transmission-rates (and thereby indirectly the rescue-function of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>) or change the rescue-function directly without affecting transmission. Mechanistically, these effects may either be achieved by affecting gonadal <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-density or by altering <italic>Wolbachia</italic>'s abilities of gamete manipulation.</p><p>Moreover, enhancing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> action in the germline could also be accomplished by emulating <italic>Wolbachia</italic>'s modification- or rescue-function autonomously without the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. A mutation acting in this way would then enable the host to increase modification or rescue without having to interfere directly with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transmission or manipulation. In this paper, we shall use the term mimicry to describe such an imitation of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> effects. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004425-t001">Table 1</xref> outlines the different mutations, groups them according to their sex-specificity and their effect on <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, and specifies mechanistic pathways through which these effects could be achieved.

We then ask whether such mutations can spread in the population. Again, we also introduce a survival cost imposed on mutant females and analyse the two cases in turn.

At equilibrium, the new &#x0201c;effective&#x0201d; transmission rate is equivalent to (1&#x02212;<italic>d</italic>)<italic>t</italic>.

These results demonstrate that, as expected, cost-free mutations increasing transmission rates can invade and spread through an infected population over nearly the entire parameter space. This is due to the fact that mutant females produce more infected female offspring that can mate compatibly with infected males, which offsets the cost of simultaneously begetting more infected males that are subject to CI in mating with uninfected females.</p><p>Prior treatments did not consider the influence of costs to enhancing female mutations. Introducing such costs complicates the matter in that reproductive benefits enjoyed by mutant females must now offset these costs in order for the mutation to spread. As a result, the parameter subspace where the mutation can invade successfully shrinks for elevated survival costs <italic>c</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004425-g005">figures 5a and 5b</xref>). Still, if the mutation does spread, the resulting elevated prevalence levels can be calculated as in the costless case (see above and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004425-g004">figure 4b</xref>). However, since sex ratios are skewed when <italic>c</italic>&#x0003e;0 (as costs are only incurred by females), the analytical predictions of equations 35 and 36 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004425.s001">Appendix S1</xref> only hold for the overall prevalence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> but not for the individual equilibria of males and females.</p><p>For the sake of completeness, we also investigated the fate of female-specific repressive mutations that lower transmission rates. As expected, these were not observed to spread since mutant females incur the cost of receiving more uninfected daughters that cannot mate compatibly with infected males. Therefore, mutant females are at a fitness disadvantage to corresponding wildtypes that beget more infected offspring &#x02013; a manifestation of the addiction-character of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Moreover, even the potential prior spread of a male-specific repressor only changes the situation qualitatively (i.e. repressive female mutants would now encounter lowered CI-levels) and thus still precludes the subsequent spread of female repressors.</p><p>Hypothetical fecundity costs incurred by infected females might be expected to change the general situation, as lowering transmission rates would then harbour the benefit of reducing average fecundity costs since more uninfected offspring are produced. Nevertheless, even in the presence of moderate fecundity costs of up to 10&#x00025;, such a mutation was never observed to spread during our numerical simulations. This may be due to the fact that fecundity costs decrease the prevalence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> at equal transmission rates and CI-levels because of the reduced fitness of infected females (see eqs. 13&#x02013;18 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004425.s001">Appendix S1</xref>). Therefore, the infection becomes unstable already at larger critical CI-levels (see eq.19 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004425.s001">Appendix S1</xref>), and the critical penetrance levels <italic>e</italic><sub>crit</sub> and <italic>d</italic><sub>crit</sub> required for loss of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> shrink accordingly. It seems that, as a result, the reduction of fecundity costs in uninfected female offspring does not suffice to offset the increased costs of CI incurred by mutant females.</p><p>For similar reasons, we observed little effect of fecundity costs when examining the success of female-specific enhancing mutations that increase transmission in situations with varying fecundity costs. At first glance, we would expect mutant benefits of receiving more infected offspring (that are not subject to CI) to trade-off with fecundity reduction of said infected offspring. However, as the presence of fecundity costs results in a larger proportion of uninfected hosts (see above), this increases the reproductive benefits enjoyed by mutant females, whereas the costs of fecundity reduction remain unaltered. As a result, threshold levels of penetrance above which the mutation may invade and spread are not shifted upwards, as intuition might suggest, but the entire curve is shifted to the right &#x02013; that is, not higher penetrance thresholds at similar CI-levels, but higher penetrance thresholds at correspondingly higher levels of CI are the result of the introduction of fecundity costs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004425-g002">figure 2</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004425.s001">Appendix S1</xref> for an illustration).</p></sec><sec id="s3b2"><title>Changing the rescue function directly</title><p>Enhancement of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> action in females could also occur if mutant females increase the rescue function directly without affecting transmission rates. In theory such an effect could be achieved if a (hypothetical) <italic>Wolbachia</italic> rescue gene were to be transferred to the host's nucleus. This is similar to the &#x02018;nuclear rescue construct&#x02019; of Sinkins and Godfray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Sinkins1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and has been considered theoretically for cost-free mutations reducing the susceptibility of uninfected ova by Turelli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Turelli1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, albeit without the focus on potentially resulting infection instabilities and loss of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Here, we add costs to the mutations and determine the effects on infection stability.</p><p>Generally, the consequences are reminiscent of a male-specific repressive mutation: The mutation induces an autonomous rescue-function in the host (irrespective of whether mutant females are infected with <italic>Wolbachia</italic>) that leads to a decrease in population CI-levels.

(equivalent to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0004425.e014.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> as derived above). If penetrance levels are below this threshold, new equilibria of reduced <italic>Wolbachia</italic> prevalence are attained.</p><p>As in the male case, such a mutation always spreads to fixation if it carries no cost for female mutants. However, if mutant females' survival chances are reduced, then penetrance levels need to be above certain thresholds for the mutation to spread (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004425-g005">figure 5c</xref>). Interestingly, these thresholds are up to 100&#x00025; higher than for a male-specific repressive mutation (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004425-g002">figure 2</xref>). This is due to the fact that mutant males only benefit from a repressive mutation if they are infected and thus would otherwise incur the cost of CI if mated with uninfected females. Mutant females, however, only benefit from enhancing mutations mimicking <italic>Wolbachia</italic>'s rescue function if they are, in fact, uninfected with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> &#x02013; otherwise their matings would not be subject to CI anyway. These results stress the importance of considering both male- and female-specific CI-reducing mutations and demonstrate that the two scenarios can, in fact, result in qualitatively different dynamics for similar parameter settings.</p><p>In contrast, the analogous mutation in females that autonomously lowers the rescue function irrespective of infection status (i.e. an &#x0201c;inverse mimic&#x0201d;) was not successful: Similar to the case of a male-specific enhancing mutation, mutants incur a higher cost of CI due to lowered rescue-levels. Thus, they suffer a fitness disadvantage relative to the wildtype, so that the mutation is not expected to spread (and was not observed to do so in our simulations).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Non sex-specific mutations</title><p>We also examined the fate of a repressive mutation that is equally active in females and in males (with <italic>d</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<italic>e</italic>) so that transmission rates and <italic>Wolbachia</italic>'s modification of sperm are reduced simultaneously. As discussed above, female-specific mutations reducing transmission rates were never observed to spread. Moreover, mutations that simultaneously repress <italic>Wolbachia</italic> manipulation of gametes in males could not spread either. As the results with effects only on females did not differ numerically from those with equal effects on both sexes, it seems that the reproductive costs and benefits of reduced transmission rates are the limiting factor for the spread of any mutation that affects transmission (and thus gametogenesis) also (or only) in females. Note that this would effectively limit the evolution of repressive host modifier alleles as long as their effect &#x02013; for example on reduction of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density during gametogenesis &#x02013; is symmetric in both sexes.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Sequential Evolution</title><p>Hypothetically, several mutations affecting <italic>Wolbachia</italic> action in the host could also arise subsequently within one population (be it through occasional migrational influx or through actual local mutation).

Moreover, we can calculate the &#x0201c;effective&#x0201d; CI-level that Wolbachia are exposed to after fixation of a host-modifier. As a result, we can approximate the fitness benefits enjoyed by a new mutation that we introduce after a previous male-specific modifier has reached fixation (see eq.38 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004425.s001">Appendix S1</xref>). For the cascade of mutations, we repeatedly calculate the fitness benefits of two such subsequent mutations until the mutations' cumulative effects have reduced CI-levels to <italic>l</italic><sub>crit.</sub> and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> goes to extinction.

As noted before, prior fixation of CI-reducing mutations in males or females does not produce conditions conducive to the spread of female specific repressors lowering transmission rates, even in the presence of fecundity costs.</p><p>Conversely, if a female-specific enhancing mutation that increases transmission rates arises first and is able to spread, then elevated effective transmission rates will restrict conditions under which costly male mutants may invade (since threshold values of <italic>e</italic> rise with higher <italic>t</italic>). Moreover, such preceding female-specific mutations with a penetrance of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0004425.e015.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> would raise local transmission rates to 1 so that subsequent male-specific repressive mutations cannot spread since they require imperfect transmission. However, perfect transmission is only reached in the absence of fecundity costs. If fecundity costs are present (i.e. <italic>f</italic>&#x0003e;0), then effective transmission rates remain below 1 so that subsequent spread of male-specific repressive mutations is still possible. Furthermore, even under complete transmission and without female fecundity costs, male repressors are expected to invade when there is a male fecundity or survival cost to being infected (which we did not explicitly consider in our model). This is because mutant males are then equally compatible with females whether they have the infection or not, and loss of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> increases fitness. In turn, this would lead to either reduced equilibrium levels or elimination of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, as before. Moreover, the presence of fecundity costs generally leads to an increase in the critical CI-level below which the infection becomes unstable and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> disappears (see above and eq.19 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004425.s001">Appendix S1</xref>). As a result, critical penetrance levels <italic>e</italic><sub>crit.</sub> shrink accordingly, so that the cumulative evolution of male-specific repressors can lead to quicker loss of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>.</p><p>Note that, although not explicitly considered in our study, there also is selection on <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to counter host adaptation, e.g. by increasing transmission rates or increasing CI-levels (as modeled in ref. 21). Such <italic>Wolbachia</italic> adaptations could result in very high symbiont-mediated transmission rates that, in turn, would weaken selection on hosts for reduced sperm modification. However, while perfect transmission has indeed been recorded under laboratory conditions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-McGraw1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>), earlier studies suggest that transmission rates can be lower in the field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Hoffmann2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, as mentioned previously, even if complete transmission occurs, selection for male repressors of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> will be favored in the infection imposes a survival or fertility cost in males.</p><p>In summary, the outcome of selection can be the consequence of two competing processes &#x02013; selection for enhanced transmission through females and selection for reduced modification in males, where consecutive mutations work synergistically within each class (that is, they ease the spread of future mutations of similar effect) and antagonistically between classes. While individual outcomes naturally depend on the specific costs and effects of the two classes of mutation, we generally expect cascades of male-specific repressors to outweigh the effect of female-specific enhancers on long evolutionary time scales. This is motivated by the fact that the presence of fecundity costs discourages the emergence of host-mediated perfect transmission. Still, even if transmission is complete, male-specific repressors would be selectively favored if Wolbachia impose a fertilitiy or survival cost on infected males. As a result, we expect this sequential sexually antagonistic process to lead to long-term loss of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> are among the most widespread and abundant infections known. They are inherited maternally within species and also move laterally between host taxa. The bacteria spread within host species due to the reproductive alterations they induce, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility, feminization, parthenogenesis, or male-killing. Phylogenetic comparisons of hosts and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> indicate that these bacteria do not persist over long time periods within most arthropod taxa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Werren1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Werren3">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Baldo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. That is, rarely does one find concordant phylogenies of the bacteria and their hosts. Therefore, the infections are relatively quickly lost on evolutionary time scales, such that they infrequently persist within a taxon across speciation events. However, in the case of CI bacteria, infection loss would appear to be difficult because elimination of the infection in females would lead to &#x0201c;sterility&#x0201d; of these females in crosses with infected males, due to CI. This has presented a paradox &#x02013; why and how are <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections lost in species.</p><p>Our study is an attempt to investigate this question. The results show that sex-specific host repressors of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in males can readily spread, even at cost to mutant males, and either result in elimination of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections or reduced infection levels within a population. Conversely, enhancers of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transmission in females are favoured under a broad range of conditions, because they enhance the probability of female eggs being compatible with sperm from infected males. Hence selection for host modifiers works antagonistically in the two sexes. The outcome of these processes may be complex, although in general, we expect that successive selection for male repressors of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can lead to long-term elimination of infections.</p><p>There is some empirical support for the notion that male-specific reduction of CI modification occurs. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are effective at inducing CI only in young males, and the infection level declines and can be lost in testes over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Clark2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Mathematically, the consequences of a mutant female's reduced susceptibility are similar to those of a mutant's males reduced sperm-modification: both lower the effective level of CI.

Further verbal arguments of sex-specific &#x0201c;resistance&#x0201d; expected nuclear genes increasing transmission rates in females to spread if <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-prevalence is higher than 50&#x00025;, while male resistance was expected to spread if less than 100&#x00025; are infected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Charlat1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Our formal model then confirms these predictions but also shows that male suppressors may spread at initial infection frequencies of 100&#x00025; (i.e. for <italic>l</italic><sub>CI</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 and <italic>t</italic>&#x0003c;1, where uninfected zygotes are produced but fail to develop due to perfect CI).</p><p>Generally, our study systematically extends the scope of possible mutations to the entire range of host modifications (i.e. from 0&#x00025; to 100&#x00025;). By explicitly considering the consequences for infection instability, we were able to deduce analytically those critical penetrance levels above which the spread of a modifier leads to loss of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> . Additionally, host modifications with small effect on, for example, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> gonadal density, seem to be biologically more plausible than the direct elimination of CI altogether. Overall, we show that spread of a male repressor can lead to loss of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> under a broad range of clearly-specifiable conditions. Moreover, spread of sub-threshold male repressors eases invasion conditions for subsequent mutations of similar kind, so that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> may be lost in a step-wise manner. As a result, increase of such sex-specific repressors may be one process explaining why CI-<italic>Wolbachia</italic> do not persist within host taxa on evolutionary timescales.</p><p>Despite <italic>Wolbachia</italic>'s lifestyle as an intracellular parasite, the expected phylogenetic congruence between hosts and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is absent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Werren1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Werren3">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Werren4">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Baldo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Baldo2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Zhou1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Our model suggests these data to be interpreted as the result of repeated loss of CI-inducing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> through the spread of host modifiers and subsequent reinfection by horizontal transfer. Earlier studies point out that invasion of non-modifying <italic>Wolbachia</italic> into infected populations could also account for the subsequent loss of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Hurst1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this explanation requires a direct cost of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to be imposed on infected females in order for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to be lost through selection. Within our model, however, a hypothetical moderate fecundity cost <italic>f</italic> that lowers infected females' fecundity levels to 1&#x02212;<italic>f</italic> had no effect on invasion success. Assuming such direct costs of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is thus unnecessary for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to be lost from the population through the mechanisms proposed by our model. This stands in contrast to previous theoretical studies of suppression of CI-inducing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Vala1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Vavre2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> that did not separately consider scenarios without fecundity costs incurred by infected females.</p><p>Empirical studies have shown two types of CI to exist in haplodiploid insects where CI-affected offspring either die (female mortality, FM) or develop as males (male development, MD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Breeuwer1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>). Previous studies show that, in contrast to the typical FM-CI, the MD-type selects for females to decrease transmission rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Vavre2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. While we did not explicitly consider this CI-type in our own modelling, this fact nonetheless substantiates the possibility of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> loss. Moreover, empirical results suggest that dosage effects of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced damage to paternal DNA may account for these differential CI-types: In simplified terms, greater damage leads to haploid embryos (and thus the MD-type in haplodiploids) whereas smaller damage allows for some paternal chromosomes to survive the first mitosis, which results in aneuploid embryos and failure of development (the FM-type; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Breeuwer2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Vavre3">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>). As a result, host-mediated changes in bacterial density might lead to changes in CI-type, as observed by Breeuwer and Werren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Breeuwer2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the host modifiers examined in our study &#x02013; especially those that have small effects on bacterial action and lead to reduced prevalence, not extinction of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> &#x02013; may provide a host-mediated pathway between different CI-types. Note that, however, even though the MD-type is more prone to host modification than the FM-type (see above and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Vavre2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>), the type of CI will only have a quantitative influence on the evolution of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-suppression, not a qualitative one: It may increase fixation times for an allele reducing CI-levels in FM- relative to MD-populations, but it does not affect the evolutionary potential of such modifier alleles on long evolutionary time scales.</p><p>Finally, given our results of the easily-observable loss of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infection, the details of the host-symbiont system under study here can be regarded as not stable but in fact circular: Any uninfected and unregulatory host-population could be infected by CI-<italic>Wolbachia</italic> (given high enough values of <italic>t</italic> and <italic>l</italic><sub>CI</sub>), thus leading to spread of the infection. Subsequent selection on the host for sex-specific repressors would lead to eventual loss of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Once the repressors declined due to mutation or selection against a costly repressor in the absence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, the species would be vulnerable to reinfection by CI inducing <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Thus infections could be cyclical within a host clade over evolutionary time. In the spirit of previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004425-Hammerstein1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, infection with CI-inducing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> does not seem to be a veritable &#x0201c;final stop&#x0201d; for any insect host population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material
