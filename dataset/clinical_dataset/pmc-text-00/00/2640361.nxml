Considering these contraversial findings, we decided to compare blood flow and duplex indices of vertebral arteries in volunteers younger and older than 60 year old to clarify the effect of aging in vertebrobasilar circulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In this prospective study, from June 2005 to June 2006, using a 7.5 MHZ linear transducer of a Hitachi EUB 525 system, we examined vertebral arteries in 96 volunteers. The youngest patient was 23 year old and the oldest one was 95 year old (age range: 23&#x02013;95 years). These patients were subdivided in two groups: in groups A, 40 patients younger than 60 year old were studied (age range: 23&#x02013;57 years, mean age: 36.25 years) including 26 males and 14 females, in group B, 56 patients older than 60 years were examined (age range: 60&#x02013;95 years, mean age: 69.21 years) including 32 males and 24 females.</p><p>We examined right and left vertebral arteries in all of volunteers and therefore 192 arteries were examined (80 in group A, 96 in group B). In all of these vessels cross sectional mean diameter, resistive index (RI), peak systolic velocity (PSV) and flow volume (FV) were measured at second part of vertebral artery (at C4 &#x02013; C5 level). The angle of insonation in all of our patients was under 60 degree, to reduce the measurement bias, and all of measurements were repeated two or three times and all of declared figures were the average of these measurements.</p><p>In all of patients in both groups, sever hemodynamic stenosis of carotid arteries was excluded by doppler examination of common and internal carotid arteries.

These findings maybe because of lesser degree of atrophy in brainstem comparing with cerebral hemispheres in elders.</p><p>Our findings are discordant with results of Muller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and Martin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] but concordant with Seidel and coworker's study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] which has highlighted age independence of doppler indices of vertebral arteries.</p><p>An interesting finding in our study is difference between right and left vertebral arteries in patients younger than 60 year old. We have showed that in young adults peak systolic velocity (PSV) and flow volume (FV) in left vertebral artery are significantly higher than right side. We think that this is because of anatomical difference of right and left vertebral arteries; in right side, subclavian artery originates from brachiocephalic artery but left subclavian artery directly originates from aorta, beside this branching angle of left vertebral artery from subclavian and also branching angle of left subclavian from aorta is more acute than same angles in right side.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MN contributed to Duplex ultrasound studies and also wrote the manuscript.
