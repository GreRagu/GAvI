However, the involvement of integrin downstream signaling molecules remains unclear. In the present study, we successfully isolated cell lines possessing different tubulogenic potentials from the MDCK cells; cyst clones (CA4, CA6) forming cystic structures when cultured in 0.3% type I collagen gel and mass clones (M610, M611, M612) forming aggregated masses. Cyst clones maintained cystic structure in 0.1% collagen gel, whereas mass clones spontaneously developed into tubules. Both clones exhibited various morphologies when cultured on a dish: cyst clones formed aggregated islands, while mass clones were more scattered and exhibited higher migration capacity. Among several focal adhesion machinery proteins examined, only the expression and phosphorylation level of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in mass clones was higher than in cyst clones, while other proteins showed no obvious differences. However, overexpression of wild type FAK in CA6 cells did not facilitate branching tubule formation in 0.1% collagen gel. Targeted decrease in the expression level of FAK in M610 cells with the application of antisense cDNA resulted in a marked reduction of branching tubule formation in 0.1% collagen gel and showed a down-regulation of fibronectin assembly, which is known to promote tubulogenesis. In contrast, overexpression of wild type FAK in CA6 cells had no effect on fibronectin assembly. Taken together, our data demonstrates that FAK is required, but not sufficient for HGF-independent branching tubulogenesis in MDCK cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Epithelial branching tubulogenesis plays an essential role in the development of several tissues such as kidney, lung, salivary and mammary glands, and the study of the underlying mechanisms has been of both basic and clinical interest. Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells cultured in collagen gel are widely used as the simplest and most convenient model for studying tubulogenesis. Clone II 3B5, isolated from MDCK cells, can undergo morphogenesis and develop into polarized, elongated and branching tubule structures under the stimulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In our previous study, we successfully isolated several MDCK sub-clones, y224 and m634, that exhibited either cystic or tubular phenotypes in low concentration of collagen gel without HGF stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These cells became excellent models for studying novel regulatory mechanisms of branching tubulogenesis.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) are key regulators for branching morphogenesis. Fibronectin, for example, is synthesized by groups of adherent cells that assemble it into a fibrillar network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Fibronectin is known to provide survival cues for MDCK cell morphogenesis and development of mouse submandibular salivary gland, kidney as well as lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Laminin, another example of ECM, is crucial in the end bud persistence and ductal elongation in the developing mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Despite the importance of extracellular matrix proteins, integrins (the membrane receptors of ECM) are also of particular significance, as the potential of branching tubulogenesis in MDCK cells was inhibited by the decrease in &#x003b1;3 integrin expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Monoclonal antibodies against either &#x003b1;6 or &#x003b2;1 subunit were shown to reduce kidney tubulogenesis <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], while temporal and spatial changes in integrin expression promoted branching morphogenesis of the developing collecting system <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Focal adhesion proteins are downstream of ECM and interact with integrins. Among all focal adhesion complex proteins, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is of greatest significance. FAK connects both integrin and growth factor receptors with the intracellular signaling pathways and has five tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Y397, Y407, Y577, Y861, Y925), each mediating a different cellular function. In general, FAK-mediated signaling affects cell motility, cell survival, and cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Because of the FAK involvement in the downstream cascade of integrin signaling, we wished to examine the role FAK in renal branching tubulogenesis.</p><p>In the present study we isolated several clones from MDCK cell line, i.e. cyst and mass clones, according to the methods described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. When both clones were cultured in 0.1% collagen gel, cyst clones formed cysts, while mass cells formed tubular structures. The investigation of the protein profiles showed that FAK expression was higher in mass clones then cyst clones. Overexpression of wild type FAK in cyst clones did not facilitate branching tube morphology when cultured in collagen gel. However, decrease of FAK expression levels by antisense cDNA in mass clones resulted in a marked reduction in branching tubule morphology in collagen gel. Our data suggest that FAK is required, but not sufficient for renal branching tubulogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and transfection</title><p>Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, GIBCO BRL) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C.

To detect the amount of assembled fibronectin in cells cultured on dish, MDCK cells were cultured in the culture medium for 24 hrs then rinsed twice with ice cold PBS. Cells were lysed in DOC lysis buffer (2% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 2 mM phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM iodoacetic acid, and 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide) and cell lysate was harvested using a cell scraper (Nunc). To detect the amount of assembled fibronectin MDCK cells were cultured in 0.1% collagen gel for 6 days. Collagen gel was digested by 0.2% collagenase under 37&#x000b0;C for 10 min.

Most of these cells develop into polarized cysts with an obvious central cavity, while the others form cell aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In the present study, we successfully isolated MDCK subclones that consistently developed either cysts (cyst clones &#x02013; CA4, CA6) or cell aggregates (mass clones &#x02013; M610, M611, M612) in 0.3% collagen gel for at least five passages.

Cyst clones revealed a well-developed association between neighboring cells and formed aggregated islands. In contrast, mass clones showed more scattered morphology when cultured on the dish (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). The scattered morphology indicates that mass clones might have greater motility than cyst clones. To test this hypothesis, we used Boyden chamber transwell assay to analyze the migration ability of these two clones.

To elevate the FAK expression level, wild type FAK was overexpressed in CA6 cells. In addition, antisense cDNA was used to decrease the FAK expression level in M610 cells. Elevation of FAK in CA6 cells increased FAK Y397 phosphorylation level. Meanwhile, reduction of FAK expression in M610 cells also diminished the FAK Y397 phosphorylation level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). We further observed the morphology of those FAK transfectants when cultured on dish. FAK-overexpressed CA6 cells (CF5) formed aggregated islands similar to CA6 and control cells (CV). However, when antisense FAK-overexpressed M610 cells (MF<sup>-</sup>9, MF<sup>-</sup>13) were cultured on dish, they showed markedly reduced scattered morphology and elevated cell-to-cell association compared to M610 and control cells (MV) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). To measure whether cell motility was altered by different FAK expression, migration capability of different FAK transfectants was analyzed by Boyden chamber with collagen as a chemoattractant. Increasing the expression level of FAK in CA6 cells did not elevate migration ability significantly; however decreasing the expression level of FAK in M610 cells reduced the migration ability in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Morphology and migration ability of FAK transfectants in cyst and mass clones</bold>. <bold>(a-b) </bold>CA6, M610, control clones (CV, MV), wild type FAK overexpressed-CA6 cell (CF5), or antisense FAK overexpressed-M610 cells (MF<sup>-</sup>9, MF<sup>-</sup>13) were cultured on dish for 24 hrs. <bold>(a) </bold>Lysates were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies to detect FAK and &#x003b2;-actin. <bold>(b) </bold>Cell morphology; images were taken under a light microscope.

In contrast, a decrease of FAK in M610 cells was accompanied by a reduction of fibronectin assembly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>). Thus, a decrease of FAK in M610 cells leads to down-regulation of tubule formation, which cannot be attributed to the reduction of fibronectin assembly. On the other hand, overexpression of wild type FAK in CA6 cells did not trigger tubulogenesis, which may be due to insufficient fibronectin assembly.</p><p>To further investigate whether FAK is also involved in HGF-dependent tubulogenesis, 3B5 cells, a subclone of MDCK cells, harboring wild type FAK or dominant negative FRNK (FAK-related non-kinase) were employed. Cells were cultured in 0.3% collagen gel with different dosage regimen of HGF stimulation. FAK-overexpressed cells were more sensitive to HGF stimulation in forming branching tubules, whereas FRNK-overexpressed cells did not survive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Taken together, our data show that FAK plays an important role in regulating branching tubulogenesis in both HGF-dependent and HGF-independent models.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>The effect of FAK on tubulogenesis in 0.3% collagen gel with different dosage of hepatocyte growth factor</bold>.

First, we isolated two different clones from MDCK cells, which proved to be a successful, HGF-independent model for tubule morphogenesis. We showed that mass clones forming tubule structures exhibited higher expression of FAK protein compared to cyst clones forming cystic morphogenesis in 0.1% collagen gel. Furthermore, the elevated FAK expression level in cyst clones cannot promote tubule formation. However, a decrease of FAK expression level in mass clones dramatically reduced branching tubule formation. Finally, we also demonstrated that FAK facilitates HGF-induced branching tubulogenesis since cells harboring wild type FAK sensitized the dose of HGF stimulation. These results indicate that FAK is involved in the regulation of both the HGF-dependent and HGF-independent branching morphogenesis.</p><p>The effects of FAK in kidney development <italic>in vivo </italic>have not been studied before, because knockout FAK in mice leads to embryonic lethal at day 8.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, observations from FAK-/- mice showed that FAK is an important regulator in vascular morphogenesis since FAK-deficient endothelial cell failed to organize into vascular networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Indeed, FAK has been shown to be required in blood vessel morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, conditional FAK knockouts in endothelial cells led to defective angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that conditional FAK knockouts in early ureteric bud may result in the failure of renal tubulogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Branching morphogenesis is a multi-step process that requires sequential cell adhesion to extracellular matrix, cell spreading, cell proliferation, and cell migration to ultimately form multicellular tube-like structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the current study, we showed that decrease of FAK expression in M610 cells inhibited branching morphogenesis that was accompanied by the reduction of FAK phosphorylation and cell motility. However, overexpression of FAK in CA6 cells failed to elevate migration capacity, tubule formation and phosphorylation of FAK Y397 in collagen gel. Since there was a high agreement between the phosphorylation level of FAK Y397 and tubule formation, it is likely that FAK 397 phosphorylation may also play an important role in renal morphogenesis in MDCK cells.</p><p>Our previous study showed that MDCK cells cultured in collagen gel exhibited deposition of fibronectin underlying the epithelium, which may prevent apoptosis and therefore can possibly facilitate cyst or tubule growth of MDCK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recently, FAK was reported to promote organization of fibronectin matrix in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Likewise, FAK may also regulate fibronectin assembly in MDCK cells. We reason that the decrease of FAK expression in M610 cells results in poor fibronectin deposition and hence leads to inhibition of branching tubulogenesis. Moreover, it has been reported that FAKY397 phosphorylation is highly regulated by substratum stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Well-assembled fibronectin around the cell may serve as a stiff substrate to further promote FAKY397 phosphorylation. Thus, mass clones are likely to possess higher potential to assemble fibronectin and to induce greater FAK phosphorylation. Finally, there may be a positive feedback loop in regulating FAK phosphorylation and fibronectin assembly during renal tubulogenesis.</p><p>To summarize, we have shown that FAK is critical for renal branching tubulogenesis through regulation of cell migration and fibronectin assembly. Our studies revealed FAK is involved in renal tubulogenesis, which may be also involved in other tissue morphogenesis such as mammary gland, pancreas or lung.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WCW participated in the design and performed statistical analysis of the results and drafted the manuscript.
