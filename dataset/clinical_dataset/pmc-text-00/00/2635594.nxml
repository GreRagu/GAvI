The number of breastfeeding groups increased from 10 to 27 in intervention localities, where 1310 women attended, and remained at 10 groups in control localities. No significant differences in breastfeeding outcomes were found.

Any breast feeding at 6-8 weeks increased from 38% to 39% in localities not participating in the trial. Women who attended breastfeeding groups were older (P&#x0003c;0.001) than women initiating breast feeding who did not attend and had higher income (P=0.02) than women in the control localities who attended postnatal groups.

We chose a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial design to randomise primary care populations to receive a policy intervention. We used qualitative and quantitative methods to build embedded prospective case studies to investigate the amount of intervention delivered and the group characteristics and to compare group activity between intervention and control localities.

We recruited 14 localities, and general practice membership remained unchanged throughout the trial, despite national reorganisation of primary care. The main reasons for localities not participating were lack of capacity owing to shortages of staff, skills, or funds or service reorganisation (n=16); low initiation of breast feeding or existing groups meeting demand (n=16); and unacceptability of the control arm as they wanted to develop groups (n=12).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> We used a two stage consent process: at locality manager level and for individual women attending a group for the first time. Written and verbal information was given to pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers at 28 week antenatal appointments; at subsequent contacts with midwives, health visitors, and volunteers; and through posters in clinics and community venues. </p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>This was a pragmatic trial, and locality staff implemented the policy largely within existing resources. Figure 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"/> shows a time line describing the complex intervention and associated research activity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> and the box describes the policy. We asked each intervention locality to at least double their number of breastfeeding groups, to set up a minimum of two new groups, and to provide population coverage. Our aim was to design a policy that was reproducible for the purpose of the trial but would incorporate some features of the action research process, which was thought to contribute to the success of the preliminary study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> In the preliminary study, one precisely defined, reproducible group model did not suit all areas; however, we considered six characteristics to be important and fixed these for the BIG trial (box): weekly group meetings; women only; a health professional group facilitator; pregnant women and breastfeeding women invited to attend; at least 50% of the group meeting time to be social and interactive; and a woman centred approach. The finer details of group venue, timing, continuity of facilitator(s), structure, content, ambience, refreshments, and child care arrangements were flexible and could be decided locally. Intervention localities had four months before the start of the trial to find group venues, attend training, and appoint a local investigator.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><caption><p><bold>Fig 1</bold>&#x02002;Timing and characteristics of intervention</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="hodp579185.f1"/></fig><boxed-text position="float" content-type="style2"><sec><title>Breastfeeding group policy</title><sec><title>In localities</title><sec><title>Amount of intervention to be achieved</title><p>We asked each intervention locality to at least double the amount of breastfeeding group activity, set up a minimum of two new breastfeeding groups, and ensure that all main population centres had access to a breastfeeding group</p></sec><sec><title>Resources provided</title><p>Each locality appointed a local investigator who was a health visitor with an interest in breast feeding.

Secondary outcomes were the number of babies receiving any breast milk at birth, 5-7 days, and 8-9 months, as well as maternal satisfaction and social support. Breastfeeding outcome data came from two routinely collected national databases: CHSP data collected by health visitors at the first visit, which records feeding at birth, at discharge from hospital, and around 10 days; the 6-8 week and 8-9 month child development reviews<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>; and Guthrie data collected by midwives at days 5-7 for the phenylketonuria screening programme, in which the blood spot card documents the current feeding method.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> Comparing Guthrie and CHSP data, with their different collection methods, enabled us to assess completeness of population coverage.

The questionnaire also asked about sociodemographic characteristics, feeding history, attendance at birth related groups, and their perceived helpfulness.</p><p>We collected quantitative and qualitative data (fig 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"/>) to build case studies at two levels: the case defined as the locality (intervention and control) to investigate differences in implementation of the intervention and in routine care between all areas and the case defined as the group to evaluate group styles and processes. In this paper, we report case study data that relate to the amount of intervention delivered and baby-friendly hospital initiative accreditation. We did a pre-trial audit of breastfeeding groups to map activity across Scotland, which we repeated at the end of the trial (table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"/>). Consenting first time group attenders (women and facilitators) completed a characteristics questionnaire. Their unique identifier and group content and structure were recorded in group meeting diaries. We did four structured telephone surveys with 45 key informants from 14 localities to monitor breastfeeding group activity, other breastfeeding initiatives, and changes in maternity and child health services during the intervention.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>&#x02002; Characteristics of intervention, control, and non-participating

attending breastfeeding groups (intervention) and postnatal groups (control) during three separate one week periods throughout the trial, covering different times of year, and spaced out to minimise the risk of including women more than once. The main NHS cost was staff time. NHS staff attending intervention locality groups completed work diaries over one week and recorded group and travel time in group meeting diaries.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The minimum expected clinically important difference between breastfeeding rates at 6-8 weeks was 6.4% over two years, which in theory would have enabled Scotland to meet its government target of 50% of women breast feeding at 6 weeks by 2005. Using 2001-2 data, we estimated a pooled standard deviation of 9.3% and a correlation between pre-intervention and post-intervention rates of 0.9. A standardised difference of 0.7 (6.4%/9.3%) could be detected with 80% power at the 5% level of significance with 66 units in total at one time point. By using correlated pre-intervention and post-intervention measurements, we needed approximately 13 localities (68&#x000d7;(1&#x02212;0.9<sup>2</sup>)), rounded up to an even 14 in our original power calculations. The revised estimate of pooled standard deviation of 7.4% from the recruited sample indicated that we needed approximately eight localities (42&#x000d7;(1&#x02212;0.9<sup>2</sup>)). We expected woman level secondary outcomes to have an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.01 in clusters of approximately 100.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Localities varied in size, baseline breastfeeding rates, the number of pre-existing groups, and how pregnancy and postnatal care were organised.

We analysed the difference in breastfeeding rates between intervention and control localities by using analysis of covariance, with pre-intervention breastfeeding rates as a covariate. By stratifying randomisation by pre-intervention outcome data (a strong determinant of outcome), we considered intervention and control groups to be comparable. We analysed individual level secondary outcomes by using linear or Poisson regression with adjustment for clustering. Binary variables needed logistic regression, and counts of group attendances needed zero inflated Poisson regression, both adjusted for clustering. We used either SPSS (version 15) or Stata (version 10) for analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Figure 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/> shows the flow of participants.

Mean willingness to pay to attend the groups was &#x000a3;2.42 for the intervention group and &#x000a3;2.54 for the control group; the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. This figure should be interpreted carefully, as women had also incurred time and travel costs to attend the groups and 83.8% of respondents in the intervention groups stated that the benefits to them of attending the group were greater than the costs to them; only 2.7% stated that the costs were greater than the benefits.</p><table-wrap id="tbl4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>&#x02002;Comparison of income, travel times, and car journey distances for breastfeeding (intervention) and postnatal (control) groups.

Our intervention may not have worked because insufficient women attended groups in pregnancy (the intended behaviour) and before six to eight weeks after birth to influence population breastfeeding rates. Groups attract older and higher income women who are more likely to continue breast feeding anyway,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> and social support levels were generally high. A trial of groups for the prevention of postnatal depression reports similar findings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></p><p>The embedded mixed method case study design provides insight into why the preliminary study was effective and the trial was not.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> In the preliminary study, attendance by pregnant women was six times higher and attendance by any woman (pregnant or breast feeding) was four times higher, more midwives facilitated groups, and three out of five groups took place in community maternity units compared with only one (the best attended) of 27 groups in the trial. More centralised maternity services, reorganisation, and workforce pressures contributed to these differences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref> The preliminary study used action research methods,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> compared with a distant research team running a trial, and partnership working between midwives, health visitors, and women was less evident in the trial. Involvement of midwives is crucial to recruit pregnant women to groups, as health visitors&#x02019; first contact is usually 10-14 days after birth, when 17% of women have stopped breast feeding.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> The discontinuity of professional care during women&#x02019;s breastfeeding journey from pregnancy to weaning warrants review, as maternity care has changed considerably with shorter hospital stays.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Few trials of a public health policy in primary care have been done. This trial illustrates the value of routinely collected data on infant feeding and the challenges of systematically collecting non-routine data at population level. Unfortunately, national policy changes led to abandonment of collection of 8-9 month routine breastfeeding data after the first trial quarter, despite the fact that the trial was government funded. Trials of perinatal education, support, or behaviour modification interventions in group settings often use selected samples, in highly controlled environments with experts delivering the intervention,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref> which raises questions about generalisability. A strength of this pragmatic trial is that it was designed to take place in a routine service setting, delivered by front line health professionals.</p><p>Participating localities were more deprived and had lower baseline breastfeeding rates than the Scottish average. However, the large numbers of women included may have inflated the importance of the small changes in maternal age and deprivation seen. Our findings may not be generalisable to less deprived populations or countries with higher breastfeeding rates, where breast feeding is more socially acceptable and sustaining groups might be easier. Qualitative case study data (to be reported separately) suggest that operational factors, particularly socio-geographic characteristics of localities including deprivation, staff resources, the amount of organisational change, and the style of management and leadership, all affected implementation of the trial and seem to explain why breastfeeding rates declined in three intervention localities.</p><p>During the intervention, more babies were born in hospitals that achieved the baby-friendly hospital initiative award or the certificate of commitment in control localities, and initiation of breast feeding increased in these localities. In retrospect, some people might argue that we could have matched by baby-friendly hospital status, given the evidence that it increases duration of breast feeding.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> However, our data support the view that in the UK the initiative does not have an effect beyond initiation of breast feeding and that earlier research showing an increase in breast feeding at 5-7 days might depend on the amount of time since the award was achieved.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref> The changes in status therefore seem unlikely to have outweighed the effects of the intervention, but we cannot rule this out.</p><p>Attending groups and developing social networks may have other short term and long term benefits that we did not measure. Few conclusions can be drawn from our questionnaire derived secondary outcomes owing to the low response rate. Reported attendance rates were higher at general antenatal groups than at breastfeeding groups in both trial arms, and we would recommend review of the current practice of providing separate antenatal breastfeeding education.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>If the NHS aims to increase breastfeeding rates, a policy to provide breastfeeding groups, despite being a low cost option that women attending find helpful, is nevertheless ineffective in the current organisational context. Resources may be better directed to the first two weeks after birth, when the highest proportion of women stop breast feeding.</p><boxed-text position="float" content-type="style3"><sec><title>What is already known on this topic</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Additional professional and lay support increases the duration and exclusivity of breast feeding</p></list-item><list-item><p>Little is known about the effectiveness of a group setting for breastfeeding interventions</p></list-item><list-item><p>Older and higher income women are more likely to initiate breast feeding</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What this study adds</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Breastfeeding support groups, facilitated by health professionals, for pregnant and breastfeeding women did not improve breastfeeding rates in the first six to eight weeks after birth</p></list-item><list-item><p>Of women initiating breast feeding, older women were more likely to attend groups; women attending breastfeeding groups had a higher income than those attending postnatal groups</p></list-item><list-item><p>The costs of providing groups are similar to the costs of home visits by health visitors</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text></sec></sec></body><back><notes><fn-group><fn><p>We thank all the managers, health professionals, volunteers, and women who participated in this trial and made it possible.
