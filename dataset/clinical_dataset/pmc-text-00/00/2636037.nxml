A pilot study was done in one of the colleges of VallabhVidyanagar (where students use computers as a part of theircurriculum), under PSBH (Problem Solving for Better Health)project by final MBBS students of P. S. Medical College,Karamsad. This study revealed 20% prevalence of computer-related health problems. Considering 20% allowable errorand using formula Z<sup>2</sup><sub>&#x003b1;/2</sub> pq/E<sup>2</sup>, sample size turned out to be400. Forty were added to this figure, taking into account 10%nonresponders. Thus, 440 was the final sample size.</p><p>After seeking approval of the human research ethicalcommittee of P. S. Medical College, Karamsad, establishmentsand institutes where computers are extensively used, inAnand and Petlad <italic>taluka</italic>, were enlisted. These included banks,computer training centers and colleges running degree coursesin computer applications. Heads of these institutes wereapproached for permitting institute&#x02032;s faculty members and finalyear students to participate in the study. They were explainedthe aims, objectives and methodology of the project. Afterseeking their permission, all the staff and faculty members, aswell as final year students, were enlisted. Four hundred andforty subjects were selected randomly. Twenty-one subjectsdid not participate in the study, making the nonresponse rate4.8%. Rest of the subjects (n = 419) were asked to fill a pre-tested questionnaire, after obtaining their verbal consent. Otherrelevant information was obtained by personal interview andinspection of workstation. None of the subjects were found tobe suffering from conjunctivitis or inflammation of eyelids.To know about the habit of taking breaks, respondents wereasked whether they take a 3 to 5 min break after each hourof continuous computer work and a 10 to 15-min break after2 hours of continuous computer work (as per OR-OSHAguidelines),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref> i.e., moving around or doing some work otherthan computer operation. Asthenopia was considered whentwo of the following symptoms were reported during or afterwork on computer: smarting sensation, gritty feeling, itchingin eyes, aches, sensitivity, redness, tears in excess, dryness,discomfort in seeing, blurring of vision and discoloration ofobjects. Observations were analyzed and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was applied tofind out the association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean age of the subjects who participated in this study was25.04 years, with a range of 18 to 55 years. Three-fourths of thesubjects were young, with age of 15 to 25 years; and 279 (66.6%)were male [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Out of all respondents, only 1 (0.2%) wasdiabetic and 4 (1.0%) were hypertensive. A majority of subjects,i.e., 391 (93.3%) subjects, started use of computers at a youngage, of less than 25 years; and 294 (70.2%) subjects reportedhabit of taking breaks during computer work [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Twohundred thirty-six (56.3%) subjects were using computerssince less than 5 years, and 172 (41.1%) subjects used to workon computers for about 21 to 40 h in a week [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Out oftotal 151 (36.0%) subjects with refractive error [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>], 148(35.3%) were using glasses; and only 3 (0.7%) were wearingcontact lenses during computer work. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref> depicts that277 (66.1%) subjects used to keep an eye distance of 13 to24 inches from the monitor screen while working on thecomputer, whereas 262 (62.5%) subjects had the top of theircomputer screen at the same level of eyes. Antiglare screenwas used by 142 (33.9%) computer operators, while 327 (78.0%)were adjusting contrast and brightness of the computerscreen as per their need [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>]. In our study, asthenopiawas reported in 194 (46.3%) subjects during or after work oncomputer, out of which 51 (26.0%) were strongly asthenopic,reporting at least one of the symptoms of asthenopia everyday, while 145 (74.0%) experienced it occasionally. Eighteenout of 33 subjects in the age group of 36 to 55 years reportedasthenopia. Marginally higher proportion of asthenopia wasnoted in females compared to males. Asthenopia was notfound to be associated with age or gender of subject [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table1</xref>], habit of taking breaks [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>] and duration of computeruse, both in terms of number of years as well as hours perweek [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]; while statistically significant association (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05) was found between occurrence of asthenopia and ageof starting use of computers [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>], presence of refractiveerror [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>], eye distance from the screen of monitor andlevel of top of the computer screen [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>], as well as use ofantiglare screen and adjustment of contrast and brightness asper need [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Computer has now become basic and essential desktopequipment in almost every establishment. But the human-computer interface is not free from health hazards. The researchover the past two decades shows that visual-comfort problemsassociated with VDTs such as computer are real.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> Our studyfound a high prevalence of asthenopia (46.3%) in computeroperators. Mocci <italic>et al</italic>. reported the prevalence of this asthenopiaas 31.9% in their study performed on 385 bank workers of Italy,out of which 13.6% were strongly asthenopic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>; while Sanchez-Roman <italic>et al</italic>. found this prevalence to be as high as 68.5% intheir study in Spain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></p><p>Though asthenopia was reported to be higher in the olderage group and in females in our study, it was not statisticallysignificant. Asthenopia was correlated with age and genderin the study by Mocci <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Visual symptom scores in VDToperators were found to be higher among females than malesin a Japanese study by Shima <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> However, they did notfind any difference with respect to age. Rocha and Debert-Ribeiro studied systems analysts in Brazil and found thatvisual fatigue was associated with gender, being higher infemale analysts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></p><p>Correlation of age of starting use of computers withoccurrence of visual discomfort has not been studied much.In our study, age of starting use of computer was found tobe a predictor of asthenopia. While considering duration ofcomputer use, review of literature reveals a mixed pictureas far as occurrence of asthenopia is concerned. Hanne <italic>et al</italic>.found a significant difference in asthenopia and daily hours ofVDT work between workers working less than 6 h daily andthose working more than 6 hours daily.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> Similarly, a reviewby Kanitkar <italic>et al</italic>. showed that duration of computer work isdirectly related to eye symptoms, and longer duration tendsto result in long-lasting complaints, well after VDT work isfinished.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Bergqvist and Knave,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Sanchez-Roman <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> andShima <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> reported similar results. However, no correlationwas found between asthenopia and number of hours of work aday at the VDT or number of years spent performing the samework duties in a study by Mocci <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Similarly, our study didnot find any association between duration of computer use, bothin terms of hours/ week and number of years, and asthenopia.Habit of taking breaks during computer work also showedsimilar result in the present study.</p><p>Our study observed that the subjects having refractive error(even when corrected) are more likely to develop asthenopia.Investigations on visual health complaints by VDT operatorsby Bergqvist <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> and Nakaishi <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> have shown similarrelationship between asthenopia and presence of refractiveerror in the subjects.</p><p>The viewing distance, i.e., the distance between theoperator&#x02032;s eyes and monitor screen, should be individuallyadjusted. However, placing the VDT 50 to 70 cm away allows forphysiologic resting levels of convergence and accommodation.Recent studies demonstrate that farther placement of themonitor (90 to 100 cm) may produce even fewer symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>Taptagaporn <italic>et al</italic>. based on their study, recommended viewingdistance of 50 to 70 cm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> Jaschinski <italic>et al</italic>. found that the changefrom greater to lesser viewing distance produced a largerincrease in eyestrain when the VDTs were at eye level.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> Theirstudy also revealed that when operators were free to adjustthe viewing distance to achieve the most comfortable screenposition, the participants preferred viewing distances between60 and 100 cm. In our study, asthenopia was less in subjectswhose viewing distance was more than 30 cm (12 inches) andhighest when it was less than 30 cm (12 inches), which wasstatistically significant.</p><p>Various studies have shown that apart from viewingdistance, viewing angle can be a contributing factor in theoccurrence of asthenopia. Taptagaporn <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> as well asQuaranta <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> recommended a downward gaze so as to workcomfortably on VDT. Bergqvist and Knave reported increasedodds ratios for certain eye discomfort symptoms when thecomputer operator keeps the terminal at about eye level ratherthan below eye level.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> Jaschinski <italic>et al</italic>. in their study, found thathigh screens result in greater eyestrain than low screens.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> Weclassified the respondents in our study into three categories:those who have the top of their computer screen (1) above thelevel of eyes, (2) at the same level of eyes and (3) below thelevel of eyes. Significantly higher proportion of subjects whohad their computer screen at or above the eye level reportedasthenopia.</p><p>A WHO press release (1998) mentions that glare andreflections from VDT displays can be a source of eyestrainand headache. Use of antiglare filters over VDT screens hasbeen associated with shorter, less frequent and less intense eyecomplaints in some studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Our study observed significantlylower prevalence of asthenopia in the subjects who usedantiglare screen. Similar was the observation in those whoadjusted the contrast and brightness of the monitor screen asper their need.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study suggests that asthenopia is a common problemamong computer operators, particularly in those who start itsuse at an early age. Presence of refractive error, eye distancefrom the monitor screen and level of eyes in relation to top of thescreen were other associated factors identified for occurrence ofasthenopia. Our study also found that use of antiglare screenand adjustment of contrast and brightness as per need mightreduce the risk of asthenopia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Source of Support: Funded by Charutar Arogya Mandal MedicalResearch Society, H.
