It has been known for some time that the MSL complex specifically targets the polytene X chromosome at hundreds of sites in a reproducible, banded pattern, but the rules that govern specific targeting are only recently becoming evident with the application of high resolution approaches such as ChIP-chip.</p><p id="P5"><italic>Drosophila</italic> MSL3 (<underline>m</underline>ale-<underline>s</underline>pecific <underline>l</underline>ethal 3) is a conserved protein containing an N-terminal chromodomain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>. In the absence of MSL3, partial MSL complexes can only target a subset of sites on X, termed high affinity or chromatin entry sites (CES), originally mapped at the cytological level to approximately 35&#x02013;70 locations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>. Initial targeting of chromatin entry sites is postulated to provide the X chromosome-specificity of dosage compensation.

In the absence of a <italic>roX</italic> gene <italic>in cis</italic>, autosomes would never normally be targeted by the MSL complex. However, when MSL complex is ectopically localized on autosomes, flanking secondary sites display the same characteristics of typical targets seen on the X, correlating with 3&#x02019; enrichment of H3K36me3 on active genes. Formally, it is still possible that there is a sequence component to 3&#x02019; recognition, but if so, it is not specific to X chromosomal genes.</p><p id="P7">Spreading is a concept resting on a foundation of observations from the study of gene silencing and heterochromatin. The idea originated from the discovery and analysis of position-effect variegation in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>. The molecular mechanism of spreading is most clearly defined by the study of silencing of mating type genes in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, in which Swi6 and Clr4 are chromodomain proteins that play prominent roles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>.

We previously demonstrated that formation of the complete MSL pattern on the X was dependent on MSL3 and H3K36me3, providing a circumstantial case for the involvement of the MSL3 chromodomain in spreading of the dosage compensation complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. Yet, the chromodomain of MSL3 has been mutated and deemed dispensable for MSL targeting at the cytological level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>. Here, by high resolution ChIP-chip, we demonstrate that MSL3 chromodomain mutants in <italic>Drosophila</italic> actually fail to bind the majority of genes on the X.

The mutants were constructed in the context of a wild-type transgene fused to the TAP (Tandem Affinity Purification) epitope tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The chromodomain deletion was created by mutating the start codon for full-length MSL3, ablating its expression and leading to overproduction of a naturally-occuring short form initiating at Met127, downstream of the chromodomain. The peptide composition of the short form was confirmed by TAP-tag affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The site-directed mutants designed to disrupt chromodomain function altered the following residues: 1) Y31 along with its neighboring residues L30 and T32 into alanines to obtain the LYT30A mutant; 2) Y63 along with S62 and D64 into alanines resulting in the SYD62A mutant; and 3) W59 into a glycine to create the W59G mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p id="P9">We inserted all mutant transgenes, as well as the WT construct, into the same genomic location on chromosome 2L (55C-D) using the &#x003a6;C31 mediated attB/attP site-specific recombination system to avoid position effects on transgene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>. To assess the function of the mutants, we scored the ability of these transgenes to rescue <italic>msl3<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). The WT construct could rescue <italic>msl3<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant males efficiently (97%). It was previously shown that an <italic>msl3</italic> mutant partially deleted for the chromodomain was sub-viable, with only 7% of mutant males reaching adulthood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>. We observed higher viability for our &#x00394;CD construct; roughly half of mutant males (53%) survived into adulthood, with the rest dying as late pupae. Although viable, all &#x00394;CD mutant males were developmentally delayed by 2 days with respect to their heterozygous brothers carrying the <italic>msl3<sup>+</sup></italic> TM3 balancer chromosome, and displayed phenotypes such as held-out wings. Adult males were unhealthy and infertile. We observed similar results with two of the chromodomain missense mutants, SYD62A and W59G. Their mutant rescue was 62% and 77% respectively, and mutant males were developmentally delayed by 2 days. In contrast, the LYT30A mutant failed to complement <italic>msl3<sup>1</sup></italic>.</p><p id="P10">The lack of a functional chromodomain in MSL3 might lead to lower levels of stable MSL complex, and if this were the case, it would be difficult to assign a specific function to the conserved motif. Therefore, we performed Western analysis of males expressing the transgenes in the absence of endogenous <italic>msl3</italic> to determine the levels of the MSL3-TAP mutant proteins. The expression of the LYT30A mutant was assessed in an <italic>msl3<sup>+</sup></italic> background, due to the inviability of these males. Consistent with its lack of rescue, the LYT30A mutant protein appeared to be highly unstable, and thus was deemed uninformative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In contrast, we found that the W59G, SYD62A, and &#x00394;CD mutant proteins were expressed at levels comparable to WT MSL3. To assay for complex assembly, we affinity purified the W59G, SYD62A, and &#x00394;CD mutant proteins from cell lysates using the TAP epitope, and in each case we could detect co-immunoprecipitation of MSL1 and MOF by Western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Although this was a qualitative rather than quantitative assessment, the result is in agreement with previous studies, in which an intact MRG domain preserved functional interactions with the other components of the MSL complex, even in the absence of the chromodomain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ChIP-chip analysis of chromodomain mutant binding</title><p id="P11">Polytene chromosome binding patterns of the &#x00394;CD, SYD62A and W59G mutant proteins on the X chromosome were indistinguishable from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). This was previously the basis for the conclusion that MSL targeting was normal in the absence of the MSL3 chromodomain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>. However, we reasoned that differences in binding might only be seen at the level of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) as observed for MSL binding in a <italic>set2</italic> mutant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. Immunostaining of polytene chromosomes is non-linear and its resolution cannot distinguish between association with single sites and binding to multiple, tightly-clustered genes. Therefore, we performed ChIP-chip analysis using a mixed-population of <italic>msl3<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant male and <italic>msl3<sup>+</sup></italic> female embryos expressing the WT, &#x00394;CD or SYD62A constructs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref> for crosses). Since females lack MSL2 and hence do not have functional MSL complexes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>, they do not contribute positively to the ChIP signal. We performed ChIP using the TAP epitope to immunoprecipitate chromatin fragments bound by the WT, &#x00394;CD and SYD62A proteins, and characterized the resulting DNA on our previously described custom Nimblegen tiling arrays, which cover the entire euchromatic X chromosome and the left arm of chromosome 2 as a negative control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> (388,000 &#x000d7; 50mer probes tiled at 100bp resolution).</p><p id="P12">Each experiment was performed in duplicate per genotype and the signal intensities from both profiles were used to calculate a mean signal intensity value for each probe on the array. A computational algorithm was applied to locate statistically significant clusters of binding, assessing the minimum level of enrichment and the size of cluster (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S9">Methods</xref>). The total number of bound clusters was calculated for each genotype and the number of bound genes within the clusters was determined. Using these criteria, WT MSL3-TAP protein bound to 1337 genes within 694 clusters on the X and 9 clusters were bound on chromosome arm 2L. Chromodomain mutants retained a strong bias for the X, but bound to only a subset of the WT targets. 340 genes were mapped within 338 clusters in the SYD62A mutant (with 13 clusters on 2L) and 432 genes were mapped within 444 clusters in the &#x00394;CD mutant (with 15 clusters on 2L). Therefore, at least two-thirds of WT target genes were scored as unbound in the SYD62A and &#x00394;CD mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The clusters in chromodomain mutants were also smaller and contained fewer genes on average than WT (~1.0 gene per cluster for SYD62A or &#x00394;CD; ~1.9 genes per cluster for WT).</p><p id="P13">What characterizes the chromodomain-independent genes on the X? One possibility is that those are the genes that exhibit the highest occupancy or signal for the WT complex. When we plotted histograms of MSL3 occupancy (i.e. signal intensities from the WT ChIP-chip experiment) over each gene on the X, we found that the genes bound by the chromodomain mutants do fall within the region of high signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the smaller amount of binding observed in the MSL3 mutants was a consequence of experimental or statistical procedure, we compared the signal intensity of each probe in the WT (x-axis) to its intensity in the &#x00394;CD experiment (y-axis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). If the signal on one array is simply a muted version of the signal on the other array, the probe values should be scattered along a single line. Instead we see that there are two separate probe clusters. This clearly shows that only a specific subclass of probes remains bound by the &#x00394;CD mutant rather than a general decrease across all probes.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>MSL3 chromodomain mutants retain entry site binding</title><p id="P14">Interestingly, when individual ChIP-chip profiles of chromodomain mutant binding sites are compared to WT, they show graphically what might be expected for initial recognition sites of the MSL complex: discrete peaks of binding in place of coverage of whole genes and neighboring genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Noting the pattern, we wondered whether the discrete peaks might reflect binding to chromatin entry sites, with a loss of spreading to cover whole genes and flanking targets. Chromatin entry sites (CES) were originally defined as the 35&#x02013;70 sites seen on polytene chromosomes of <italic>msl3</italic> null mutant larvae. However, we recently proposed that this was an underestimate based on ChIP-chip experiments of <italic>msl3<sup>1</sup></italic> null mutant embryos, in which we identified a set of at least 150 candidate entry sites containing a GA- or TC&#x02013;rich <underline>M</underline>SL <underline>r</underline>ecognition <underline>e</underline>lement (MRE) required for MSL binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>. Therefore, we examined whether the ~400 binding sites detected in our chromodomain mutants included the 150 newly defined chromatin entry sites. We found that 98% of the CES were contained within the SYD62A and &#x00394;CD sets of binding clusters. Furthermore, when we searched for ~8&#x02013;25bp motifs using the MEME algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>, the top sequence identified using 500 bp peaks from either SYD62A or &#x00394;CD clusters was a GA-rich motif that aligns extremely well with the MRE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3b</xref>). However, not all &#x00394;CD sites have MREs. When we surveyed 500 bp segments centered on the peaks within SYD62A or &#x00394;CD clusters, ~190 sites in both cases contain an MRE at a <italic>p</italic> value of 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>. Using a 1 Kb window, these numbers were ~240; further increasing the window size had minimal effect. This indicates that a substantial number of binding sites in chromodomain mutants (up to 200) do not encompass an MRE. These sites generally displayed a lower signal in our mutant ChIP-chip analysis (data not shown). Therefore, we wondered whether these additional binding sites might be the result of a limited amount of spreading retained in the chromodomain mutants.</p><p id="P15">To investigate this, we probed the spatial relationship between the 150 CES defined by Alekseyenko et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> and the additional sites bound by SYD62A and &#x00394;CD mutants. We computed the distribution of the distances of bound probes to their nearest CES in WT and each chromodomain mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). This analysis indicated that spreading in WT may generally occur within 5&#x02013;10 kb on either side of a CES, roughly corresponding to the size of an interband or a thin band on polytene chromosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>. In contrast, binding in the SYD62A and &#x00394;CD mutants clustered almost exclusively around the 150 CES. Although the two mutants differed in the absolute number of binding sites scored as positive in the ChIP-chip experiments, the distribution of those sites shows that the mutants have quite similar profiles that differ substantially from the wild-type profile. In the mutants, the number of bound probes fell sharply past 1 kb on either side of the proposed chromatin entry sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>), suggesting an appreciable reduction in spreading.</p><p id="P16">While this analysis showed a clear difference between mutants and wild-type in the extent of MSL binding at a distance from CES, differences between WT and chromodomain mutant patterns disappear when plotted at 30 kb resolution, since the majority of MSL binding sites are clustered within a few kilobases of an entry site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). This explains the previous inability to detect differences in immunostaining at the level of polytene chromosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>. We conclude that chromodomain mutants recognize a defined set of chromatin entry sites through the MRE motif, with a limited amount of additional binding that may represent very local (&#x0003c;2 kb) spreading <italic>in cis</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>MSL3 chromodomain mutants are defective in spreading</title><p id="P17">To further probe the ability of the SYD62A and &#x00394;CD proteins to direct spreading, we asked whether expression of the mutant proteins might visibly interfere with the extensive wild-type spreading seen from an autosomal <italic>roX</italic> transgene insertion on polytene chromosomes. We used a transgenic line carrying a <italic>GMroX2</italic> transgene at 26D8, which shows extensive spreading in the absence of <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> genes on the X (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>). We analyzed the behavior of the mutant proteins and their effects on wild-type complexes, in a dominant assay with one functional copy of the endogenous wild-type <italic>msl3<sup>+</sup></italic> gene present. When stained for the TAP epitope, transgenic WT MSL3 showed consistent and extensive spreading around the <italic>roX2</italic> insertion in close to 100% of nuclei, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4b</xref>). However, the chromodomain mutants failed to do so to varying extents. In <italic>msl3<sup>1</sup></italic> heterozygotes carrying a &#x00394;CD transgene, about half of all nuclei showed spreading of both MSL3TAP and MSL2, albeit not as extensive as the WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4c</xref>). The remaining nuclei did not show any spreading for either MSL3TAP or MSL2 although both proteins were detected at the transgene insertion site. In the W59G point mutant, most nuclei showed spreading for MSL3TAP and MSL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4d</xref>). The most pronounced defect was in the SYD62A mutant, where almost all nuclei lacked spreading for both MSL3TAP and MSL2 even though wild-type MSL3 protein was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Therefore, chromodomain mutant proteins can interfere with ectopic spreading of endogenous MSL complexes, even in the presence of wild-type MSL3. This argues against a model in which simply lowering the level of complex results in the loss of binding seen in &#x00394;CD mutants. Rather, the lack of an intact chromodomain is specifically implicated in diminished spreading from chromatin entry sites.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Defective H3K36me3 binding by MSL3 chromodomain mutants</title><p id="P18">How does the MSL3 chromodomain mediate local spreading?

Furthermore, apparent spreading in wild type clearly correlated with the H3K36me3 mark surrounding chromatin entry sites (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref> for an example).</p><p id="P21">The hypothesis that H3K36me3 functions in spreading led us to wonder whether chromatin entry sites might be more likely to be located in regions of the genome enriched for this mark. We found that this is indeed the case (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). When X chromosome locations with potential MSL recognition elements (MREs) are characterized with respect to the average density of the H3K36me3 mark, it is clear that MREs in regions with higher H3K36me3 signal are the most likely to fall within functional chromatin entry sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Together, these data further support a model in which the MSL3 chromodomain mediates MSL spreading through association with the H3K36me3 mark.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">In this study, we provide evidence that initial targeting and spreading aspects of the MSL complex are separable steps required to achieve the final MSL binding pattern on the X, the latter of which is mediated by the chromodomain of the MSL3 component. By making stable but functionally defective MSL3 mutants, we were able to uncouple these two activities and study them in isolation.</p><p id="P23">By comparing ChIP-chip data obtained from WT and MSL3 chromodomain mutants, we identified 2 classes of target genes on the X; a chromodomain-independent group (~25% of all targets) and a larger chromodomain-dependent group (~75% of all targets). The chromodomain-independent group encompasses a larger set of chromatin entry sites than originally postulated from analyses of polytene chromosomes in <italic>msl3</italic> null mutants. The difference could be related to a reduction in overall MSL complex levels when MSL3 protein is completely absent. Thus, it is possible that there is an entry site within the majority of active gene clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). If spreading of MSL complex is generally a short-range phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>), this could also explain why the complex seems to fail to spread at the cytological level into autosomal fragments inserted on the X and vice versa<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>. Having hundreds rather than a more limited set of initiation sites would make <italic>Drosophila</italic> dosage compensation targeting more similar to the C.<italic>elegans</italic> model than previously suspected<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>.</p><p id="P24">The data presented here are summarized in a two-step model for targeting of the MSL complex to the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). In this model, there are 2 classes of MSL target genes on the X, sequence-dependent chromatin entry sites and chromodomain-dependent active genes. Initially, MSL complex recognizes specific MREs within entry sites on the X chromosome, leading to local acetylation of nearby targets<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>. The local acetylation at these sites is sufficient for marginal survival and this step is independent of the MSL3 chromodomain. In a second step, the MSL3 chromodomain directs the complex to more distant genes by recognizing H3K36 methylated nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a</xref>), probably in conjunction with general DNA and nucleosomal binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>. Whether MSL complex actually traverses intergenic regions or releases and reattaches to nearby active genes is not known. Furthermore, chromodomain defects may lead to secondary effects on spreading through other MSL subunits, although our nucleosomal binding analysis using recombinant MSL3 protein strongly suggests a direct effect. Regardless, in the absence of the MSL3 chromodomain, the spreading step is defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b</xref>). How far the complex will travel without the chromodomain may depend on the local MSL concentration at the nearest chromatin entry site.</p><p id="P25">This work, together with a large body of gene-silencing literature, suggests an important parallel between principles for organizing chromatin into active and silent domains. Groups studying the mechanism of heterochromatin initiation and propagation have long embraced the spreading concept, while it has been less evident that similar mechanisms function to organize active chromatin. In the field of <italic>Drosophila</italic> dosage compensation, the spreading idea continues to be debated. Here we show that the chromodomain can be an important facilitator for establishment of an upregulated, active chromatin state. Our results support a genomic organization model in which chromodomains are key componenets for establishment of both active and silent chromatin domains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Fly genetics and transgenesis</title><p id="P26">We carried out mutagenesis using a derivative of Invitrogen&#x02019;s GATEWAY&#x02122; entry vector pENTR&#x02122;4 containing a 6 kb BamHI <italic>msl3-tap</italic> fragment (pENTR4-MSL3TAP), and the Stratagene XL mutagenesis kit.
