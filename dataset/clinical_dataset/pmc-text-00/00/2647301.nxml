A selection experiment identified point mutations in the enzyme that act synergistically to improve endonuclease activity. The amino-acid substitutions increase target affinity, alter the thermal cleavage profile and significantly increase targeted recombination in transfected cells. The RNA splicing activity is not affected by these mutations. The improvement in DNA cleavage activity is largely focused on one of the enzyme's two active sites, corresponding to a rearrangement of a lysine residue hypothesized to act as a general base. Most of the constructs isolated in the screen contain one or more mutations that revert an amino-acid identity to a residue found in one or more close homologues of I-AniI. This implies that mutations that have previously reduced the endonuclease activity of I-AniI are identified and reversed, sometimes in combination with additional &#x02018;artificial&#x02019; mutations, to optimize its <italic>in vivo</italic> activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Homing endonucleases (HEs) are highly specific DNA-binding and cleavage enzymes that are encoded by open reading frames that are embedded within intervening sequences (introns and inteins) in all microbial forms of life, including phage, eubacteria, archaea and single cell eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). First discovered in the 1980s as the drivers of mobile introns in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), HEs promote the mobility of the intervening sequences (and their own reading frames) by generating double strand breaks in homologous alleles that lack the intron or intein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Break repair leads to transfer of the element via homologous recombination, using the allele that contains the HE gene as a template. Thus, HE genes are selfish DNA sequences that are inherited in a dominant, non-Mendelian manner.</p><p>Based on primary sequence homology, five homing enzyme families have been identified, each primarily associated with a unique size and distribution of host genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>): the LAGLIDADG endonucleases (usually found in archaea and fungal and algal organellar genomes), His-Cys Box family (protist nuclear genomes), the HNH and GIY-YIG endonucleases (usually found in bacteriophage, but with additional rare exceptions in bacteria) and the PD-(D/E)XK family (found in bacterial genomes). The His-Cys Box and HNH family appear to be descended from a common ancestral nuclease (which also gave rise to bacterial colicins and many additional DNA modifying enzymes), while the remaining three families each contain a unique catalytic scaffold and appear to have arisen independently of one another.</p><p>The structures of several LHEs bound to their DNA targets have been determined, as summarized in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). All of these endonucleases display highly modularized structures and DNA-binding scaffolds that are amenable to engineering and selection experiments. Monomeric LHEs (that contain two active sites and two DNA recognition regions on a single peptide chain) are particularly compact proteins (&#x0223c;200&#x02013;250 amino acids total) that can recognize very asymmetric DNA target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>LHEs are the most specific of all known naturally occurring DNA-binding enzymes, recognizing DNA target sites ranging in length from 20 to 24 basepairs with low nanomolar dissociation constants. Their specificity of cognate DNA recognition and cleavage, and the structural basis for this behavior, has been evaluated both for the homodimeric I-<italic>Cre</italic>I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and for the monomeric I-AniI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) endonucleases. In both studies, the estimated cleavage specificity of the wild-type (WT) endonuclease under ideal <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage conditions approaches 1 in 10<sup>9</sup>. Extensive experimentation by a wide variety of laboratories, mostly with the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I endonuclease, indicate little or no toxicity when the enzyme is transfected and expressed in a variety of cellular experimental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>The collaboration between HE genes and their surrounding introns or inteins represent an efficient symbiotic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The extra-Mendelian inheritance of these elements is driven by the endonuclease, assuring that they rapidly become fixed in a population. In return, the self-splicing intron or intein serves as a refuge for the endonuclease gene, allowing it to invade but not inactivate the host gene. However, after invasion and fixation occurs there is little selective pressure for the maintenance of a functional HE, leading to the gradual accumulation of mutations that reduce its activity. This evolutionary degradation eventually leads to loss of the endonuclease gene and the surrounding intron, followed by subsequent re-invasion. This HE life cycle has been especially well illustrated in a comparative study of analogous HEs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>A small but significant fraction of HE genes has acquired a secondary activity that provides a benefit to the host. As a result of this activity, these proteins are therefore subject to purifying selection that helps maintain their fold and stability. For example, a subset of HEs also facilitates the splicing of their host intron (a behavior termed &#x02018;maturase&#x02019; activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17 B18">14&#x02013;18</xref>). While the presence of the intron itself might not benefit the host <italic>per se</italic>, its splicing is necessary for proper function of the surrounding gene. A HE that is required for intron splicing is therefore under &#x02018;partial&#x02019; selection for its DNA cleavage activity. The overall fold of the protein must be maintained in order to maintain splicing activity (which obviously also helps maintain its endonuclease capabilities) but individual mutations that only reduce DNA cleavage are still under minimal purifying selection pressure.</p><p>Those naturally-occurring HEs that moonlight as splicing cofactors (or as any other factor that benefits the host) are more persistent in the genome, but often display a chronic disability in their DNA cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Here we study these points using a model HE (I-AniI) that is a very efficient intron splicing cofactor, but a quite inefficient endonuclease. We conducted an <italic>in vivo</italic> selection experiment for mutated variants of I-AniI that display enhanced cleavage of its DNA target. This experiment yields several reoptimized endonuclease constructs, harboring between one and four point mutations, which display significantly enhanced activity in the screen. Most of these mutations correspond to residues found in homologues of I-AniI, while some are unique. These amino-acid substitutions act synergistically to restore DNA cleavage activity. The construct containing the fewest point mutations of the WT enzyme sequence (and that also displays near 100% recovery in the cleavage activity screen) binds the WT DNA target more tightly, exhibits a catalytic rate enhancement for one of its two active sites, is more active at low physiological temperatures, and is much more efficient at stimulating recombination than its WT parent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Proteins</title><p>All I-AniI constructs used for <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments were expressed and purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), with the exception that expression was induced at 15&#x000b0;C for &#x0223c;20 h after the culture had achieved early log growth phase (OD<sub>600</sub> &#x0223c; 0.6). For all experiments, two point mutations (F80K and L232K) were introduced that improve the solubility of the enzyme and facilitate biochemical studies as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Both mutations are far removed from the DNA-binding surface of the enzyme, and are on exposed surfaces of &#x003b1;-helices.</p></sec><sec><title>Bacteria-based <italic>in vivo</italic> cleavage assay and selection</title><p>This cleavage assay was performed based on the previous report by Doyon <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Two copies each of a WT target site or the closely related &#x02018;LIB4&#x02019; site (that harbors two basepair substitutions and is bound and cleaved more readily by the endonuclease) were inserted between <italic>Afl</italic>III and <italic>Bgl</italic>II and between <italic>Nhe</italic>I and <italic>Sac</italic>II in the reporter (pCcdB) plasmid (four copies total). This plasmid encodes &#x02018;control of cell death B&#x02019;, a toxic protein to bacteria, and the expression of this gene is induced by isopropyl-&#x003b2;-thio-galactopyranoside (IPTG). The open reading frame (ORF) of the I-AniI construct described above was amplified by PCR, in order to incorporate an <italic>Nco</italic>I site and <italic>Not</italic>I site at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; termini, and was cloned into the expression (pEndo) plasmid. The HE gene is tightly regulated by pBAD promoter, and addition of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose promotes the gene transcription. The pEndo plasmid was transformed into DH12S competent cells harboring pCcdB plasmid (containing four copies of WT target site or LIB4 site) by electroporation. The transformants were grown in 2&#x000d7; YT medium at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min, and were 5-fold diluted with 2&#x000d7; YT medium supplemented with 125 mg/ml carbenicillin and 0.025% <sc>L</sc>-arabinose. After the culture was grown at 30&#x000b0;C for 4 h, the cells were harvested, resuspended in sterilized water, and spread on both the non-selective plates (1&#x000d7; M9 salt, 1% glycerol, 0.8% tryptone, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 &#x003bc;g/ml thiamine and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml carbenicillin) and selective plates (the non-selective plates supplemented with 0.02% <sc>L</sc>-arabinose and 0.4 mM IPTG). The plates were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for two days, and the cleavage activity was evaluated by comparing the number of the colonies between the non-selective and the selective plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of I-AniI variants with efficient cleavage in bacteria by random mutagenesis</title><p>Random mutations were induced in I-AniI ORF using GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), by following the manufacture's instruction, and the amplified fragments with <italic>Nco</italic>I/<italic>Not</italic>I sites were inserted between <italic>Nco</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I sites in pEndo plasmid. The library with random mutations were transformed into DH12S competent cells harboring pCcdB including WT target site, and the transformants were selected on the selective plates as described above. The survival colonies were streaked on both the selective plates and the negative control plates (the non-selective plates supplemented with 0.02% <sc>l</sc>-arabinose and 35 &#x003bc;g/ml chloramphenicol), and the mutated endonuclease genes were amplified by PCR from clones that could survive only on the selective plates. The PCR fragments were cloned into pEndo plasmid, and were selected with the same procedures as for the first round selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Far-UV circular dichroism</title><p>CD spectra were recorded at 25&#x000b0;C between 190 and 260 nm using 0.1 cm path length quartz cuvettes (Hellma) and 6 &#x003bc;M I-AniI variants in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The spectra were analyzed in the continuous mode with 1 nm bandwidth, 8 s response, and a scan speed of 10 nm/min. Thermal denaturation curves were obtained by measuring the ellipticity of 10 nM protein at 222 nm from 5 to 80&#x000b0;C at 2&#x000b0;C/min. These experiments were independently repeated three times.</p></sec><sec><title>Isothermal titration calorimetry</title><p>The dissociation constant and thermodynamic values of Y2 I-AniI binding WT target or LIB4 target DNA sequences were analyzed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Briefly, Y2 I-AniI and the target DNA dialyzed in ITC buffer (50 mM <italic>Tris</italic>-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) were quantified by UV spectroscopy, using extinction coefficients to calculate concentrations. Sample concentrations ranged from 5.5 to 6.0 &#x000b5;M I-AniI and 38 to 60 &#x000b5;M dsDNA target. A VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (&#x000b5;Cal) was used for all experiments, with the protein sample in the cell and the DNA target in the auto-pipette. Individual runs consisted of 30 injections of 5-8 &#x000b5;L each, depending on sample concentrations, and were conducted at 30&#x000b0;C with a 351 r.p.m. stirring speed.

The reaction mixtures (20 &#x003bc;l) contained 50 mM <italic>Tris</italic>-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 ng (&#x0223c;11 nM) of the DNA substrates, and the indicated amounts of I-AniI variants. The reactions ran at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min, and were terminated by adding 5 &#x003bc;l of stop buffer (100 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 2.5% SDS, 10% glycerol and 0.01% bromophenol blue). The products were separated on a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide, and quantified as described above.</p><p>For kinetic determination of the relative rates of individual DNA strand cleavage events, the 28 basepair DNA substrate was prepared from two oligonucleotides: 5&#x02032;-ATTTGAGGAGGTTTCTCTGTAAATAATG and 5&#x02032;- CATTATTTACAGAGAAACCTCCTCAAAT. Oligonucleotides to be 5&#x02032; end-labelled were incubated in buffer with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Beverly, Massachusetts) and [&#x003b3;<sup>&#x02212;32</sup>P]-ATP (6000 Ci/mmole; Perkin Elmer Boston, Massachusetts). The reactions were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 45 min extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol solution (25:24:1; PCI), and centrifuged through a Sephadex G-50 spun column (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, M0).</p><p>The substrate duplex was formed by incubating the labelled oligo (1.25 &#x003bc;M, final) with the corresponding unlabelled partner oligo (5 &#x003bc;M, final) in 50 mM <italic>Tris</italic>-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 50 mM NaCl (TMN buffer) at 90&#x000b0;C for 2 min and then cooled to 25&#x000b0;C over 20 min. DNA cleavage reactions were carried out at 37&#x000b0;C and contained substrate (6.25 nM) and TMN and the reactions initiated by the addition of WT I-AniI or Y2 I-AniI to a final concentration of 400 nM. Aliquots were removed at specific times (ranging from 0.5 to 40 min) and the reactions terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 67 mM, followed by organic extraction. Samples were electrophoresed on 8% acrylamide/7 M urea gels, dried and exposed on a phosphorimager screen and visualized/quantified using a phosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The imager counts in the substrate and product were summed and the fraction product plotted against time.

Three of the thirteen mutations (23%) correspond exactly to residues found in one or more close homologues of I-AniI: I55V, S92T and S111Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Two additional mutations (F13L and K49Q) correspond to similar amino acids also found in those homologues (an isoleucine is found at residue 13 and either an asparagine or an aspartate at residue 49). One construct contained a single mutation (F13Y); this mutation displayed a 180-fold increase in survival and recovery over WT I-AniI. Eight out of nine variants contained a mutation at this position (F13Y, L or V). A variant of I-AniI harboring only two mutations (F13Y/S111Y) yielded nearly 100% survival rates and formation of larger colonies than other variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

The F13Y mutation (located in the first LAGLIDADG helix of the protein scaffold, positioned in the protein's hydrophobic core) was the single amino-acid substitution that contributed most significantly to an increase in the survival rate. The effect of this mutation was enhanced in the presence of several additional mutations, particularly the addition of S111Y (the additional mutation present in the &#x02018;Y2 I-AniI&#x02019; constructs). This amino-acid substitution corresponds to the most strongly conserved alternative residue in homologues of I-AniI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). On its own, the S111Y substitution increases survival by over 10-fold relative to WT I-AniI (2.7% recovery versus less than 0.2%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Although the addition of the S111Y mutation to F13Y offered the most direct route to complete optimization of endonuclease activity, a variety of alternate combinations of mutations also increase bacterial survival (including those that echo conserved residues in I-AniI homologues, and others that are unique to the output of the screen). The mutations I55V and S92T, both of which are also recapitulated in one or more naturally occurring homologues of I-AniI, independently increase survival by &#x0223c;2-fold and up to 30-fold, respectively when compared to analogous variants that lack those mutations. Similarly, the mutation F91I (which does not correspond to naturally occurring residues in homologues of I-AniI) also enhanced activity and survival.</p><p>Three additional mutations found in the survivors from the activity screen (K46Q, K49Q and K222R) alter a series of surface-exposed basic residues that are clustered together on a surface far from the bound DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Various combinations of these three mutations in control experiments indicate that the contribution of those residues to activity and survival is relatively minimal. It is possible that these mutations block a secondary nucleic acid binding activity (perhaps related to its maturase function) in such a way as to reduce a competing source of toxicity caused by over-expression of the protein.</p><p>Taken together, it appears that five individual mutations (F13Y, I55V, F91I, S92T and S111Y/F) contribute most significantly, in various combinations, to observed improvements in cleavage of WT I-AniI site in bacteria. Simultaneous incorporation of all of these substitutions (F13Y/I55V/F91I/S92T/S111Y; termed &#x02018;M5 I-AniI&#x02019;) facilitated significant cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) at a level similar to Y2 I-AniI, suggesting that the combination of all five mutations neither impairs nor further improves the activity of the enzyme in transfected cells, relative to the simpler Y2 double mutation (F13Y/S111Y).

In contrast, the Y2 I-AniI variant hydrolyzed the substrate more efficiently, at reduced concentrations of enzyme. Under the same reaction conditions, Y2 and WT enzyme constructs cleave the &#x02018;LIB4&#x02019; substrate with similar efficiencies (data not shown). Therefore, the selected enzyme constructs display improved activity against the &#x02018;suboptimal&#x02019;, WT I-AniI site (which was used in the selection), but not against the closely related LIB4 site (which was not used in the selection). This implies that the specificity of the Y2 I-AniI construct is slightly reduced with respect to discrimination between these two target sequences; additional studies of binding and cleavage specifities across the entire target site are in progress.</p><p>I-AniI is an asymmetric LHE that displays a sequential mechanism of DNA cleavage.

This region contains one of the two amino-acid substitutions in the Y2 construct (S111Y) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B and 6C). The overall bend angles of the DNA in the WT and Y2 complexes were also quite similar (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1007/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>), although with a local shift in the major groove dimensions spanning several basepairs, as described below. The structure indicates that mutation of serine 111 to tyrosine (S111Y) causes a rearrangement of several neighboring residues that leads to a repositioning of the N-terminal active site lysine residue (K94).</p><p>Residue Y111 in the Y2 variant makes a new, direct contact with the DNA backbone near base &#x02212;11C (one position upstream from the protein's specifically recognized target site) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). This contact, and the motion of the surrounding residues, results in a corresponding shift in the neighboring side chain of R120 and a movement of the bottom DNA strand (at positions from &#x02212;3 to &#x02212;6) by up to 2.3&#x000c5;, resulting in a localized narrowing of the DNA major groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). These conformational changes are augmented by significant rotations of the side chains of N93 (which is a structural neighbor to R120) and its immediate neighbor, K94. The amino nitrogen of this latter side chain, which is hypothesized to act as a general base in one of the two endonuclease active sites, moves by 2.5&#x000c5; toward the first LAGLIDADG motif, into a conformation that mirrors that of its K227 counterpart in the C-terminal active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1007/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>).</p><p>The base-pairing interactions at positions &#x02212;3 and &#x02212;4 in the target site (which display the largest change in position relative to the WT complex, and are the sites of specific, high affinity interactions with several protein residues) are maintained by shift of the guanine bases of the top strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F). Contacts between these bases and the protein (R59 and &#x02212;4G, R61 and &#x02212;3G, and E35 and &#x02212;4C) are also maintained by slight changes in rotameric conformations of those side chains.</p><p>In contrast to the direct influence of the S111Y mutation on the structure of the N-terminal active site, residue 13 in I-AniI (the site of a the F13Y substitution from the screen) is buried in the hydrophobic protein core of the protein's N-terminal domain, and does not seem to cause major changes in the hydrophobic residues around Y13, other than the addition of an additional hydroxyl group that is in contact with the neighboring protein backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>G).</p><p>A schematic representation of the contacts exhibited by the WT endonuclease and the Y2 variant are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1007/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5</ext-link>. The Y2 I-AniI/DNA complex is packed in a different space group relative to the WT I-AniI/DNA complex, and the Y2 variant structure was solved at relatively lower resolution (2.7&#x000c5;). Nevertheless, the Y2 enzyme displays very similar protein-DNA interactions, especially with respect to direct contacts to DNA bases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Laboratory reoptimization of homing endonuclease activity partially reverses evolutionary drift</title><p>It has been reported that LHEs can accomplish invasion of intron-deficient alleles with much higher frequency than expected from their measured <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage efficiencies, suggesting that a significant amount of mutational deterioration can occur before the persistence and propagation of the endonuclease is irreversibly compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). I-AniI clearly displays many of the suboptimal biophysical and enzymatic properties outlined above, that were reoptimized in the laboratory through the identification of amino-acid substitutions that were selected solely on the basis of improved cleavage activity in bacteria. These mutations, when considered separately and in combination, appear to affect the protein scaffold in three ways: by increasing target site affinity, by improving the catalytic efficiency of one active site, and by increasing cleavage activity at 30&#x000b0;C (a temperature well below the thermal optima of the WT enzyme).</p><p>The F13Y mutation, which is part of the LAGLIDADG sequence motif and is found in the protein core, clearly represents the most significant mutational &#x02018;hot spot&#x02019; identified in the cleavage activity screen (with mutations to both leucine and valine also recovered in addition to tyrosine). This residue is conserved as a phenylalanine in five out of six of the closest homologues of I-AniI (with an isoleucine found in one sequence; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). When the sequence alignment to I-AniI is extended to more distant homologues (corresponding to BLAST alignment E values of 10<sup>&#x02212;30</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) this residue is observed to be heavily diverged, with its position predominantly occupied by small aliphatic and &#x003b2;-branched amino acids (especially valine and threonine).</p><p>Given the location of this residue in the completely buried hydrophobic core of the protein, it seems likely that the effect of the mutations recovered at residue 13 (F13Y/L/V) is to increase the global dynamic flexibility of the protein, leading to the reduced thermal temperature profile exhibited by both the Y2 and the M5 enzyme constructs (and the increased survival at the <italic>in vivo</italic> screening temperature of 30&#x000b0;C). Such effects have been well-documented in both artificially engineered and naturally-occurring enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35 B36">34&#x02013;36</xref>). If true, this may imply that the ancestral form of I-AniI and its immediate homologues originated in a more thermophilic host organism [prior to transfer to fungal genome(s) such as <italic>Aspergillus</italic>] and that the variation of this residue position strongly influences overall catalytic efficiency as a function of ambient temperature.</p><p>The additional mutation recovered in the Y2 I-AniI variant (S111Y) appears to convert the corresponding amino-acid identity to a residue (tyrosine) that is more strongly conserved in homologous endonucleases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests that ancestors of the I-AniI endonuclease lineage may have possessed a tyrosine residue at this position, which is conserved in most homologues in a multi-sequence alignment. A crystal structure analysis of the Y2 variant, combined with the kinetics of individual strand cleavage events, indicates that this mutation is coupled to conformational rearrangements of both the protein and the DNA substrate that lead to a beneficial rearrangement, and catalytic enhancement, of the N-terminal active site. However, on its own this mutation has less effect on <italic>in vivo</italic> activity than does F13Y (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the poor <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of I-AniI in the bacterial screen appears to primarily result from inadequate activity at low temperature, and secondarily from a slightly malformed active site in one of the two protein domains. It may be that at significantly elevated temperatures, the relative importance of the two mutations in the Y2 I-AniI construct would be reversed, with the S111Y mutation contributing most strongly to the catalytic performance of the enzyme.</p><p>The position of two additional mutations that individually synergize with F13Y (I55V and S92T) appears to partially share structural and evolutionary features with the S111Y mutation described above. The side chain of V55 is in proximity to the DNA backbone (positioned to make non-specific contacts to the substrate) and S92T is also found in close proximity to K94 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, the route to recovery of robust <italic>in vivo</italic> endonuclease activity seems to consistently involve a mutation that alters the thermal profile of the enzyme in combination with at least one additional mutation that alters the structure of the protein-DNA interface and/or the architecture of one of the two active sites.</p><p>Although almost all individual mutations described above are readily observed in homologues of I-AniI, their exact combination(s), as recovered in active clones from the screen, are not. This might be explained by two facts. First, the number of potential combinatorial interactions between distant residues in the protein scaffold, that act synergistically to optimize multiple properties and functions (thermal activity, binding affinity and catalytic efficiency) are virtually limitless. Second, the selection pressure applied at each amino-acid position in the screen (to improve DNA cleavage activity) is not a precise counterpart to the selection pressure imposed on those same residues in nature. I-AniI is a bifunctional enzyme that acts both as a highly specific endonuclease and also as an RNA maturase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This latter activity (in which the protein facilitates folding and splicing of its cognate intron) is required for proper expression of the mitochondrial apocytochrome b oxidase gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), and thus provides a benefit to the host that leads to selection pressure for maintenance of the LAGLIDADG protein-fold. While acquisition of this secondary function can therefore indirectly stabilize endonuclease activity during the course of evolution, it would also suppress those mutations that are detrimental to RNA splicing but would otherwise optimize DNA cleavage activity.</p><p>If the selection pressures for the two activities of I-AniI and its homologues were strongly balanced, it is possible that certain amino-acid positions in I-AniI and its closest homologues might display elevated frequencies of asynonymous amino-acid substitutions caused by &#x02018;genetic conflict&#x02019; &#x02013; in this case, positions where the requirements for endonuclease and maturase functions produce closely balanced, antagonistic selection pressures in favor of different residues types. This possibility was examined by subjecting the sequences of I-AniI and its homologues (using a BLAST alignment E value cutoff of 10&#x02013;6) to a &#x02018;Ka/Ks&#x02019; analysis (searching for elevated levels of non-synonymous substitutions, relative to silent or synonymous substitutions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Absolutely no residues in the endonuclease were found to display elevated ratios of Ka/Ks; all positions appear to be under either neutral or purifying selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Asymmetry in monomeric LHEs active sites</title><p>I-AniI, which is a monomeric endonuclease with two separate structural domains, can cleave asymmetric DNA sequences in a highly sequence-specific manner and is an excellent model of an initial protein scaffold for development of a gene-specific reagent. The results described above indicate that during evolution this endonuclease or one of its immediate predecessors suffered a mutation (Y111S) that perturbed one of two active sites.</p><p>In addition to I-AniI, several additional homing monomeric LHEs have also been shown to display significant asymmetry in their DNA cleavage properties. The algal endonuclease I-CpaII displays specific DNA nicking behavior that varies as a function of metal concentration, preferentially nicking the bottom strand of its target site at low (&#x0003c;0.5 mM) magnesium concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Similarly, the yeast HEs I-SceI recognizes its asymmetrical site with higher affinity binding to the 3&#x02032;-DNA half-site, leading to accumulation of nicked intermediates during the cleavage reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Finally, the archaeal endonuclease I-DmoI cleaves the coding strand of its host gene with a slight preference over the non-coding strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>); this asymmetry is enhanced in engineered variants of this enzyme in which the LAGLIDADG motif residues are exchanged for those of homologous endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p><p>We believe the structural changes in the Y2 variant of I-AniI, leading to repositioning of lysine 94 into contact with a putative nucleophilic water molecule, explains the increase in catalytic efficiency in its corresponding active site. This conclusion is in agreement with the hypothesized reaction mechanism for this family of endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), which require the presence of one or more positively charged groups to assist in deprotonation of the hydrolytic water and/or to stabilize the phosphoanion transition state. In these enzymes, the usual basic residue in each active site is a lysine residue (K98 and 98&#x02032; in I-CreI, K122 and 223 in I-SceI, K43 and 140 in I-DmoI, and K94 and K227 in I-AniI). In the very high resolution structures of the most active LAGLIDADG endonuclease, I-CreI, the positions of K98 and K98&#x02032; superimpose quite closely on the position of K94 in the Y2 variant of I-AniI.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1007/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> (R01 <award-id>GM49857</award-id> and RL1 <award-id>CA133833</award-id> to B.L.S., RL1 <award-id>CA133832</award-id> to A.M.S.); the Gates Foundation Grand Challenge Program (to A.M.S. and B.L.S.); <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source> training grant (T32 <award-id>GM07270</award-id> to M.C.); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (to R.T.).
