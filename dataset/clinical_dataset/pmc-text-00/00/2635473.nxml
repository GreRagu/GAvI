With this we investigated the advantages and limitations of SU over conventional dual channel ratiometric methods using two well characterized FRET-based reporters of calcium (Yellow Cameleon (YC3.1) and CerTN-L15). Both theses reporters are genetically encoded fusions of calcium binding moieties (calmodulin and troponin-C, respectively) and two fluorescent proteins having overlapping spectra, and undergo a change in FRET efficiency in response to changes in intracellular &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;. First, we assessed the performance of our method in shot noise limited conditions. Then, we assayed SU for the detection of calcium dependent FRET signals from the calcium reporter YC3.1, which was co-expressed with ATP-gated P2X<sub>2</sub> calcium channels in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and stimulated with ATP. In transgenic mice expressing CerTN-L15, we investigated the performance of SU on FRET signals evoked in mitral cells of the olfactory bulb in response to odor stimulation. We found that with SU, FRET sensitivity was improved, and that reporter efficiency was limiting. Computer simulations supported these conclusions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setup</title><p>We used a custom-build two-photon laser scanning microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004418-g001">Figure 1.A</xref>) equipped with a femtosecond Ti:Saphire laser (FL) (Tsunami<sup>TM</sup>, Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA, USA), tunable from 740 to 1000 nm, and galvanometric scanners (GS) (VM500, General Scanning, Watertown, MA, USA). Pixel dwell time was 6 &#x000b5;s for all images. A telescope (L1&#x02013;L2) was used to expend the beam 3 times. All images were acquired with a 63x water immersion objective (HCX APO, 63&#x000d7;, NA 0.9, Leica, Germany). Collected fluorescence was split into four spectral channels composed of three dichroic mirrors DM2, DM3 and DM4 and four photomultiplier tubes (PMT) (R6357, Hamamatsu, Japan): BD, GD, YD and RD. Emission filters could be placed in front of each detector (not displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004418-g001">Figure 1.A</xref>). Low resolution, four point spectra were acquired in parallel for all pixels.

We computed the three cut-off wavelengths that maximized the sum of square SNR of each contribution. Cut-off wavelengths were moved in 5 nm steps and all possible combinations of three cut-offs were tested. We then selected standard off-the-shelf dichroic mirrors with cut-off as close as possible to the optimization results.

By averaging an increasing number of images, and unmixing the contributions of each dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004418-g001">Figure 1.B2</xref>), we found the relative contribution of the core increased from 0.81 to 0.97 as the signal to noise ratio (SNR) improved from 4.6 to 17.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004418-g001">Figure 1.B3</xref>).

We also compared the sensitivity (&#x00394;R/&#x003c3;R) of the three measurement methods, with &#x003c3;R corresponding to the standard deviation of the FRET ratio before stimulation and found that &#x00394;R<sub>SU</sub>/&#x003c3;R<sub>SU</sub> (57.3&#x0002b;/&#x02212;5.9) was still better than &#x00394;R<sub>BP</sub>/&#x003c3;R<sub>BP</sub> (39.6&#x0002b;/&#x02212;3.9) or &#x00394;R<sub>DC</sub>/&#x003c3;R<sub>DC</sub> (49.4&#x0002b;/&#x02212;4.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004418-g002">Figure 2.D2</xref>). Note that the sensitivity gain due to SU was not as large as the &#x00394;R/R improvement because &#x00394;R/R is normalized by baseline R mean, while sensitivity is defined with respect to baseline noise. With the DC method the increased sensitivity compared to the BP method was due to the integration of more light. Overall, SU significantly improved the sensitivity of FRET detection in comparison to the other methods (p&#x0003c;0.005, paired student t-test). Next, by covering the transfected cells (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;26) with an acute brain slice (&#x0223c;300 &#x000b5;m thick, mouse neocortex) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004418-g003">Figure 3.A</xref>), we asked how light scattering affects SU.

Because the mean &#x00394;R/R for mitral cells (magenta) was small (mean &#x00394;R/R&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;26.1&#x00025;), the average gain was near 5&#x00025;, which is a moderate improvement.

Spectral sensitivity is limited by both photon shot-noise in each channel, and by global instrumental noise. We decided to use a four-channel spectral sampling scheme to ensure a high photon count in each channel and reduce the overall instrumental noise. Note that theoretically two channels are sufficient to unmix the donor and acceptor of FRET probes. From numerical simulations we determined that the optimum cut-off wavelength for 2 channel SU of CFP/YFP FRET pairs is 510 nm (data not shown). We did not notice any difference between the results of FRET signal detection with four- or two-channel SU (summing channel 1&#x0002b;2 on one hand and 3&#x0002b;4 on the other hand). The main advantage, therefore of our four-channel detection unit is the added capability of unmixing up to four co-localized fluorophores. Considering read-out noise alone (not shot-noise), Zimmermann et al. previously showed that the efficiency of unmixing was maximal when the number of detectors equaled the number of fluorophores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004418-Zimmermann2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

With our four spectral channels, we obtained a high contrast between two non co-localized fluorophores with spectral peaks as close as 13 nm, a precise unmixing of two co-localized fluorophores in solution with variable concentrations, and finally, unmixing of four fluorescent proteins (ECFP, GFP, EYFP and tdimer2 with peaks at 475, 507, 527 and 579 nm respectively) was achieved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004418.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We conclude that four channel SU is sufficient for distinguishing colors with high spectral similarities and to separate up to four fluorophores with overlapping spectra.

Thaler and Vogel found that the highest accuracy and precision of the measured abundance ratio of a 1&#x02236;1 mixture of CFP and YFP is obtained with a two-photon excitation wavelength that creates approximately equal intensity of both fluorophores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004418-Thaler1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. They determined that the optimum wavelength is close to the wavelength at which CFP and YFP have the same two-photon action cross-section <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004418-Zipfel1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present work, we decided to use 800 nm light to excite YC3.1 and CerTN-L15. Indeed, at this wavelength, we measured contribution ratios near 1 in control conditions, which ensures the greatest precision of R according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004418-g001">Fig. 1.C3</xref> (1.15&#x0002b;/&#x02212;0.28 for HEK cells transfected with YC3.1; 0.7&#x0002b;/&#x02212;0.18 for mitral cells expressing CerTN-L15 probe). This result was somewhat surprising since at this wavelength, EYFP (or Citrine) excitation was expected to be much smaller than ECFP (or Cerulean). The most likely explanation is that, in our experimental conditions, baseline FRET efficiency is sufficiently high to induce a significant transfer of energy from donor to acceptor. Exciting YC3.1 and CerTN-L15 at 800 nm presented another advantage: at this wavelength the ratio of acceptor to donor two-photon excitation cross section is smallest<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004418-Zipfel1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, thus creating the largest &#x00394;R/R.</p><p>Note that higher wavelengths would excite fluorophores more efficiently producing brighter signals (&#x003bb;<sub>peak</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;840 nm for CFP, &#x003bb;<sub>peak</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;960 nm for YFP), reducing the noise on R. This might improve FRET signal detection. However &#x00394;R/&#x003c3;R also depends on many criteria such as the resting FRET efficiency, intrinsic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> fluctuations, probe expression level and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo,</italic> one should also take into account other considerations such as the increased penetration depth with higher wavelengths or the loss of contrast due to autofluorescence excitation.</p><p>To conclude, a more systematic wavelength scan needs to be performed to determine the optimum excitation wavelength for each specific probe and experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>SU in depth</title><p>SU of neurons with multiple colors <italic>in vivo</italic> and in depth requires a light efficient spectral imaging method. In contrast to confocal microscopy, which limits detection of fluorescence to few tens microns in depth in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004418-Centonze1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004418-Kasparov1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, our approach allowed us to greatly increase this distance in the anesthetized animal and detect odor-evoked FRET transients up to 180&#x02013;250 &#x000b5;m in depth in the main olfactory bulb. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of <italic>in vivo</italic> spectral imaging and unmixing of FRET signals at such depth.</p><p>Fundamental issues for measuring depth resolved spectra in thick biological samples are how the tissue optical properties, such as scattering and absorption, vary with wavelength. Light scattering by particles that are small compared to wavelength decreases as 1/&#x003bb;<sup>4</sup>. For larger particles, scattering tends to oscillate as a function &#x003bb;. Absorption might also play a role, although to a much smaller extent since the absorption coefficients &#x003bc;<sub>a</sub> measured in bulk biological tissues are typically 10 times smaller than the reduced scattering coefficients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004418-Cheong1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. As a consequence, the emission spectra of fluorophores inside biological samples, whether measured with our four detectors system or with a finer resolution method, are affected by the nature and thickness of the tissue through which they are recorded. For example, we observed that the fluorescence spectra of HEK cells transfected with YC3.1 was altered when imaged through a brain slice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004418.s004">Figure S4</xref>): blue and green channels were attenuated compared to yellow and red channels. The same trend was observed in YFP expressing cells in the cortex of transgenic mice (data not shown). Even though the attenuation amounted to less than 5&#x00025; of the total intensity, and thus did not affect our results, the tissue optical properties should be systematically considered and tested when performing SU in depth, particularly the spectral dependence of any fluorescent probe. Other factors that could alter the spectrum of a fluorescent cell in depth are the out-of-focus fluorescence, generated either by autofluorescent proteins or by the protein of interest being expressed in overlying cells, and the excitation laser leak that might occur especially when imaging in depth with high powers. In principle, background subtraction cancels out the mean value of these additional signals. However background temporal fluctuations (motion artifact, blood flow, fluorescence shot noise) and spatial non-uniformity will modify the signal intensity and spectrum, and alter the SU. These are some caveats to heed when performing SU in depth. As a consequence, FRET-based FCIP signals measured in depth with SU provide a reliable, yet relative rather than absolute indicator of &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d; variations.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>SU for FRET-based FCIPs</title><p>We found a clear advantage of using four-channel SU over more conventional methods to detect FRET-based FCIP activity.

What underlies this difference?</p><p>First the variation of the FRET index R in the pre-stimulus condition was much greater with mitral cells imaged <italic>in vivo</italic> than in the case of HEK cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004418-g004">Figure 4.B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004418-g002">Figure 2.C</xref>) Although this was principally due to the reduced fluorescence intensity detected, it is also possible that other factors including intrinsic &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d; variations in mitral cells or dynamic light scattering (e.g. moving red blood cells, blood vessels dilations/contractions) contributed. A second and critical difference between the results <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> was the larger response amplitude from YC3.1 expressed <italic>in vitro</italic> in HEK cells (&#x0223c;80&#x00025;) compared to the CerTN-L15 expressed in mitral cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (&#x0223c;26&#x00025;). According to the scatter plot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004418-g005">Figure 5.A</xref>, and the simulation results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004418-g005">Figure 5.B</xref>, the gain in sensitivity because of using SU would have been larger if a FRET-based calcium probe with a &#x00394;R/R above 100&#x00025; had been employed. With a small photon count, e.g. when imaging calcium dynamics in sub-cellular domains, or when measuring calcium with a high temporal resolution, the gain form using SU would have been even better. Currently most FRET based FCIPs have reported &#x00394;R/R of below 100&#x00025;. For example Heim <italic>et al</italic> measured CerTN-L15 &#x00394;R/R responses between 10 and 50&#x00025; in cortical neurons electrically stimulated by 2 to 10 action potentials (&#x00394;R/R measured with the dichroic method) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004418-Heim1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

HEK cells co-transfected with YC3.1 and P2X2 were mixed with cells transfected with GFP or tdimer2 and platted onto glass cover slips. tdimer2 is a red fluorescent protein (FP) with a peak emission at 579 nm &#x0005b;49&#x0005d;. In the mixed cells sample, some contained ECFP and EYFP in the YC3.1 probe and were ATP-sensitive due to the presence of P2X2 channels, and some were either GFP or tdimer2 positive and not ATP sensitive. ECFP, GFP and EYFP emission spectra have significant overlap (A). tdimer2 is further apart but could still suffer from bleed-through from EYFP. As a consequence, it is not possible to separate these four FPs using conventional bandpass emission filters. Thanks to their large two-photon excitation spectra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004418-Xu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> all four FPs could be excited simultaneously with a single wavelength, although not with the same efficacy. The Ti:Sapphire laser wavelength was tuned to 800 nm. To demonstrate the ability to unmix four FPs with our 4-channels SU method, we imaged a region where the 3 types of cells were simultaneously present (B) and applied 50 mM ATP in perfusion (C). The contribution of each fluorophore was computed and a merged imaged obtained where ECFP, GFP, EYFP and tdimer2 were color-coded in blue, green, yellow, and red, respectively. (D) Plot of cell 1-3 contributions as a function of time. Some cells such as cell 1 were responding to ATP with an increase of EYFP and a simultaneous decrease of ECFP. These cells had very little GFP or tdimer2 contributions (less than 8&#x00025; of the total signal). Some cells, like cells 2 and 3 in (B&#x02013;C), were bright green (red) meaning that their contributions was purely GFP (tdimer) with the other fluorophores signals representing between 3 and 10&#x00025; of the total signal (D2&#x02013;3). tdimer2 measured in cell 3 decreases slowly with time probably due to photobleaching. This result demonstrates that we can separate the contributions of four FPs with significant spectral overlaps, in spite of the low spectral resolution of our system.
