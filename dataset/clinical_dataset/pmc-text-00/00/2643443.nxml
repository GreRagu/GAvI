This association did not, however, reach statistical significance when adjusted for age, sex, and education (P&#x0003e;0.05). In the same study, participants with subclinical carotid artery disease who lived with a smoker for 30 years or more were more likely to develop dementia (relative hazard 2.38, 1.23 to 4.63), suggesting a potential interaction between exposure to secondhand smoke and subclinical cardiovascular disease. Haight et al therefore hypothesised that exposure to secondhand smoke may be detrimental to cognitive health. Further research incorporating population representative samples while controlling for other factors that may be confounders is needed.</p><p>We examined the association between exposure to secondhand smoke and cognitive impairment in a large population based sample of non-smokers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Participants were from the 1998, 1999, and 2001 waves of the Health Survey for England<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> who also participated in the 2002 wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> The Health Survey for England is a nationally representative multistage stratified random sample of the community dwelling English population. The core sample of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing is limited to adults aged 50 years or more in 2002 and is drawn from the Health Survey for England sample by postcode sector (geographical area), stratified by health authority and proportion of households in non-manual socioeconomic groups. Of 11&#x02009;234 people who took part in both the Health Survey for England and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, 8893 were non-smokers at both time points. Cotinine measurements were obtained for most of the eligible non-smoking participants in the Health Survey for England waves 1998 (73%) and 2001 (70%), whereas only a randomly selected subsample of participants received a nurse visit in the 1999 wave and therefore provided a saliva sample (8%). We restricted our analyses to the subsample of 5265 non-smoking participants whose salivary cotinine levels were measured. We excluded 22 participants with a self reported diagnosis of dementia, 205 participants who claimed to be non-smokers but used nicotine products or had salivary cotinine concentrations of 14.1 ng/ml or more (considered to be active smokers),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> and 229 who had missing values on one or more of the neuropsychological measures used to assess cognitive impairment. The remaining 4809 participants formed the sample for our analyses.</p><sec><title>Exposure to secondhand smoke</title><p>We used levels of salivary cotinine (ng/ml) measured in the Health Survey for England as a biomarker for recent exposure to secondhand smoke (cotinine is a metabolite of nicotine that has a half life of around 16-25 hours).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref> Non-stimulated saliva samples were collected according to the Health Survey for England&#x02019;s protocol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> Cotinine levels were analysed using a gas chromatograph machine (hp5890; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a rapid liquid chromatography technique by the Nicotine Laboratory at New Cross Hospital in London.</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive impairment</title><p>Cognitive impairment was assessed using neuropsychological tests incorporated in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, which are described in detail elsewhere.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> Briefly, attention and processing speed were assessed using the letter cancellation task from the Medical Research Council National Study of Health and Development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> Time orientation was assessed using questions from the mini-mental state examination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref> Immediate and delayed verbal memory were assessed using a 10-word learning task from the Health and Retirement Study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> Prospective memory was assessed by asking participants to remember to write their initials in the top left corner of a piece of paper on a clipboard when it was handed to them later in the session (closely based on a task incorporated in the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> and by asking participants to remind the interviewer to record the time when he or she announced that the cognitive section was finished. Numeracy was assessed using questions relating to simple calculations based on everyday situations, and these items have also been incorporated in the Health and Retirement Study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> The semantic verbal fluency task was taken from the Cambridge cognitive examination (CAMCOG),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> which examines how many unique animals people are able to name in one minute.</p><p>As the scoring of each individual test varied, we obtained a global cognitive function score by summing the standardised scores on each neuropsychological test.

In line with the preliminary analysis of Haight et al (59th annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology) we also investigated the potential interaction between exposure to secondhand smoke and cardiovascular disease. To take account of potential bias from non-response we used population weights from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing to make the respondent sample more representative of the population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref> Non-response to the Health Survey for England and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing both have the potential to make the respondent sample unrepresentative of the population. We therefore inverted the predicted probability of response for the responding households to provide the initial non-response weight. A further round of weighting was needed to adjust the initial household non-response weight to ensure that the weighted sample of responders closely matched the older English population. In addition, clusters and strata were used to allow for the original complex sample design of the Health Survey for England. We used Stata SE version 9.2 for all analyses (StataCorp, College Station, TX).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Table 1<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"/> shows the characteristics of those included in the analysis.

A similar pattern of results was observed for never and former smokers, and there was no interaction with a history of cardiovascular disease.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This analysis is to our knowledge the first to examine the relation between exposure to secondhand smoke and cognitive impairment in a large heterogeneous population based sample. We controlled for a wide range of covariables that are potential confounders in cognitive research and incorporated an objective biomarker for exposure to secondhand smoke (salivary cotinine concentration). Comparisons with census results show that the sample from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing has a similar sociodemographic profile to the community living English population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></p><p>Several methodological issues should be considered when interpreting our findings. The inclusion of former smokers is potentially problematic as historical exposure may be dominated by the former smoker&#x02019;s own previous smoking behaviours, and misclassification of current smoking status may be particularly likely in this group, leading to a residual confounding effect. We carried out analyses separately for former and never smokers, however, and the association between cotinine levels and cognitive impairment seemed stronger in never smokers. We also adjusted for smoking history as a potential confounder, including number of years since stopping smoking. Furthermore, we excluded 205 participants who claimed to be non-smokers but used nicotine products or had salivary cotinine concentrations of 14.1 ng/ml or more as we considered them to be active smokers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> Although cotinine is a valid, sensitive and specific biomarker for recent exposure to secondhand smoke,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref> it does not necessarily reflect exposure over the long period during which cognitive impairment typically develops. However, cotinine levels have proved to be a useful marker of general levels of exposure to secondhand smoke.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref> We analysed a series of cross sectional data acquired over a mean of 2.6 years and did not find a causal relation. Although we controlled for a wide range of potential confounders the possibility of residual confounding remains. Non-smokers with valid cotinine measurements had a similar sociodemographic profile to the total non-smoking sample of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, and these variables were controlled for in the analyses, making systematic bias unlikely.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with previous studies</title><p>Haight et al (59th annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology) reported a non-significant trend between self reported exposure to secondhand smoke and risk of incident dementia in never smokers over a six year period. Their sample comprised almost exclusively women, whereas our sample was more heterogeneous. It is possible that their findings were not significant because of the reliance on self reported exposure. Self report measures of secondhand exposure have several important limitations&#x02014;for example, living with a smoker captures less than half of the variation in cotinine concentration in non-smokers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref> and does not take into account exposure in workplaces and public places. The association we observed between objectively measured cotinine levels and cognitive impairment is consistent with studies suggesting that active smoking may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> and that exposure to secondhand smoke is associated with poor cognitive performance in children and adolescents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Possible mechanisms</title><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain why exposure to secondhand smoke may increase the odds of cognitive impairment. Exposure to secondhand smoke is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> and cardiovascular disease may in turn be associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref> While additional adjustment for medical history made little difference to the fully adjusted model, and no interaction between cotinine levels and a history of cardiovascular disease was observed, it is possible that exposure to secondhand smoke may interact with subclinical cardiovascular disease, as observed by Haight et al (59th annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology). Another study discovered that short term exposure to secondhand smoke adversely affects endothelial function in ways that immediately compromise the cardiovascular system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref> Dysfunctional endothelial cells contribute to vasoconstriction, atherogenesis, and thrombosis and may therefore compromise the blood supply to the brain. Exposure to secondhand smoke is also a risk factor for incident stroke,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> and differences in subclinical cerebrovascular disease may help to explain the noticeable individual differences in cognitive function observed during late adulthood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref> Reverse causality is also possible&#x02014;for example, participants with cognitive impairment may metabolise nicotine differently from those without cognitive impairment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest that in a large diverse sample of non-smoking adults, high levels of cotinine may be associated with increased odds of cognitive impairment. Given the ongoing international policy debate on exposure to secondhand smoke, this is a topic of major public health significance. Prospective nationally representative studies of the association between biomarkers of exposure to secondhand smoke and cognitive decline and dementia are therefore warranted to assess the relation between secondhand smoke and cognitive health with greater precision. In the meantime, our results provide new evidence to suggest that exposure to secondhand smoke may be associated with increased odds of cognitive impairment.</p><boxed-text position="float" content-type="style3"><sec><title>What is already known on this topic</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Active smoking may be a risk factor for cognitive impairment, although it is not clear whether exposure to secondhand smoke is a risk factor</p></list-item><list-item><p>No previous study has examined the association between biomarkers of exposure to secondhand smoke and cognitive impairment</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>What this study adds</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>In a large diverse sample of non-smoking adults, high levels of cotinine were associated with increased odds of cognitive impairment</p></list-item><list-item><p>A similar pattern of results was observed for never and former smokers, and there was no interaction with a history of cardiovascular disease</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text></sec></sec></body><back><notes><fn-group><fn><p>We thank Fiona McDougall (University of Cambridge) and Robert Friedland (Case Western Reserve University) for their suggestions.</p></fn><fn fn-type="participating-researchers"><p>Contributors: DJL conceived the study, acquired the data, did the statistical analysis, and is guarantor.
