This study set out to determine whether lactoferrin can delay neutrophil apoptosis and could act as a survival factor for neutrophils in SF.</p><p><bold>Methods.</bold> Human peripheral blood and SF neutrophils were incubated with iron-free lactoferrin and apoptosis determined after 9 h. SF from patients with RA was added to isolated neutrophils, with or without immunodepletion of lactoferrin, and effects on neutrophil apoptosis determined. Levels of lactoferrin in SF were assessed and related to disease duration and markers of disease activity.</p><p><bold>Results.</bold> Iron-free lactoferrin significantly delayed apoptosis of peripheral blood neutrophils, in a concentration-dependent manner after 9 h in culture (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.04). Lactoferrin could also delay apoptosis of neutrophils isolated from SF of patients with RA. SF from patients with established RA delayed apoptosis of peripheral blood neutrophils and this effect was significantly reduced by depletion of lactoferrin (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.03). Lactoferrin levels in SF from patients with established RA did not correlate with disease severity, but did correlate with markers of inflammation (CRP) and with the presence of RF.

Neutrophil apoptosis can be delayed at sites of infection in order to maximize neutrophil bactericidal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], but inappropriate extension of neutrophil survival can lead to chronic inflammation and pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Tight regulation of neutrophil apoptosis is thus required to prevent chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA. We have shown previously that neutrophil apoptosis is suppressed in the SF of patients with established RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and more recently also in those patients with disease of &#x0003c;3 months duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], contributing significantly to the persistence of inflammation. Several synovial components have already been identified as neutrophil survival factors, including type 1 IFN, GM-CSF and immune complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>]. The hypoxic environment of the synovium has also been proposed as a factor promoting neutrophil survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Identification of key microenvironmental influences on neutrophil life span within the inflamed joint may suggest further targets for therapy.</p><p>We and others have previously reported the importance of reactive oxygen species as mediators of neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>]. Neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease, a hereditary defect in reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) production, show significant inhibition of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Mice that are hypomorphic for expression of the p47<sup>phox</sup> subunit of NADPH oxidase and show a minimal neutrophil superoxide burst are highly sensitive to pristane-induced arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Here we have investigated the role of the iron-binding protein lactoferrin in regulating neutrophil apoptosis in the synovial environment. Several iron chelators, including desferrioxamine (DFO) have been shown to delay neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and the physiological iron chelator lactoferrin is often present at significant levels in SF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>].</p><p>Lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein belonging to the transferrin family and is present in secondary granules in neutrophils and milk and is released upon neutrophil activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>]. The concentration of lactoferrin in blood is normally low, i.e. 0.2&#x02013;0.6 &#x003bc;g/ml, but at sites of inflammation this is significantly raised due to its release from neutrophils and can be as high as 200 &#x003bc;g/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The effect of increased lactoferrin in the synovium has been thought to be primarily anti-inflammatory. Iron accumulates within the RA synovium and synovial macrophages release hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, which can then be converted to damaging hydroxyl radicals by free iron via the Fenton/Haber-Weiss reaction. Iron chelation by lactoferrin will thus remove a source of damaging ROI and indeed iron chelators, including lactoferrin, have been shown to reduce inflammation in animal models of inflammation, particularly septic arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and in patients with acute inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, if synovial lactoferrin also delays neutrophil apoptosis, it may have both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects within the rheumatoid joint. Lactoferrin has been reported to have pro-inflammatory effects by enhancing neutrophil adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Although an increased level of lactoferrin in SF of patients with RA has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], no study has ever looked at its role in regulating neutrophil apoptosis, though several studies have shown that it has an anti-oxidant effect on these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. As lactoferrin has been proposed as a possible therapy for RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], we felt it important to determine if it could delay neutrophil apoptosis. Our data show that lactoferrin was able to extend neutrophil life-span and that depletion of lactoferrin from SF reduced its ability to delay neutrophil apoptosis. Our results suggest that lactoferrin may not be a useful anti-inflammatory in all patients and perhaps its utility will be limited to those with excessive accumulation of iron within the joint or with septic arthritis in which extending neutrophil lifespan and function would be beneficial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Isolation and culture of human neutrophils</title><p>Neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and all subjects gave their written informed consent. Briefly, blood was collected into tubes containing EDTA and erythrocytes sedimented with 2% dextran T-500 in normal saline. Neutrophils were isolated using a discontinuous density gradient of Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK). After hypotonic lysis to eliminate any remaining erythrocytes, neutrophils were resuspended in a round-bottom polypropylene tube in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sera Laboratories International, Bolney, UK) and containing 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). The purity of isolated neutrophils was determined by Giemsa staining (Diff-Quick, Gamidor Technical Services, Didcot, UK), and light microscopy and was routinely &#x0003e;97%, with eosinophils as the main contaminating cell. For isolation of neutrophils from SF, the synovial sample was treated with 10 U/ml hyaluronidase for 20 min to reduce viscosity and then applied directly to the Percoll density gradient. Purity was routinely &#x0003e;98%.</p><p>Neutrophils were cultured in a humidified atmosphere under routine tissue culture conditions (5% CO<sub>2</sub>; &#x0223c;20% pO<sub>2</sub>), in the presence or absence of a range of concentrations of iron-free lactoferrin isolated from human milk (tissue culture grade, Sigma-Aldrich). Lactoferrin interferes with routine assays for endotoxins and for this reason all lactoferrin treatments also included 10 &#x003bc;g/ml polymyxin B (Sigma-Aldrich) to neutralize lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ensure that any effects were not due to endotoxin contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Neutrophils were also cultured with other factors known to delay their apoptosis, namely recombinant human GM-CSF (50 ng/ml) and IFN-&#x003b2; (800 IU/ml), both purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems, Abingdon, UK, and LPS (Sigma-Aldrich).</p></sec><sec><title>SF</title><p>SF was collected from the joints of patients with established RA of &#x0003e;2 yrs duration, or from patients attending a very early arthritis clinic whose arthritis was of &#x0003c;3 months duration.

All patients gave their written informed consent to their involvement in the study and the study was approved by South Birmingham Local Research Ethics Committee (Study Reference number LREC 04/Q2709/103). For immunodepletion of lactoferrin, SF was incubated with an anti-lactoferrin monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) or an isotype matched control and the antibody removed using protein G linked to magnetic beads (&#x000b5; beads, Miltenyi Biotec, Surrey, UK). The efficiency of depletion was confirmed by ELISA and any remaining lactoferrin was below the detection limit of the kit at 1 ng/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of neutrophil apoptosis</title><p>To determine the effect of various treatments on spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis cytospin preparations (5 min, 300 rpm; Cytospin 2; Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) were made and differentially stained using a Giemsa stain and assessed for the classic apoptotic morphology of condensed nucleus, reduced cytoplasm and vacuolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

Briefly, neutrophils were fixed and permeabilized using PermeaFix&#x02122; solution (Ortho Diagnostic Systems Inc., Raritan, NJ, US) for 45 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were washed twice in PBS/2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and stained with an affinity-purified rabbit anti-human active caspase-3 mAb (BD Pharmingen, Oxford, UK) or normal rabbit immunoglobulin fraction (DakoCytomation, Ely, UK) as a negative control.

Furthermore, depletion of lactoferrin from SF significantly reduced its ability to delay neutrophil apoptosis.

Lactoferrin has been injected intra-articularly in animal models of inflammation and has been shown to suppress inflammation modestly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], leading to proposals that local administration of lactoferrin may be useful in the treatment of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, lactoferrin also promotes neutrophil adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which could lead to increased recruitment and retention of neutrophils and our data shown here also reveal that it was able to significantly extend neutrophil lifespan and function. Each of these would help to increase the number of neutrophils infiltrating the inflamed joint and contribute to the persistence of inflammation. In the case of septic arthritis, it is probable that extension of neutrophil lifespan within the joint would be beneficial, increasing the bactericidal capacity of the neutrophil. Indeed, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>-induced arthritis in mice was significantly reduced by local injection of lactoferrin, whereas CIA was improved only to a modest extent and histological analysis of inflamed paws revealed extensive inflammation and erosion in control and lactoferrin-treated mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Lactoferrin may therefore have clinical utility, but we would suggest that this be restricted to infective arthritis and that its wider usage in RA cannot be argued with the same confidence at present.</p><p>Analysis of patient clinical history and markers of disease activity revealed a strong association between lactoferrin levels and CRP and RF positivity. The former is not surprising as inflammation will increase neutrophil recruitment to the joint and lead to release of lactoferrin from neutrophil granules. What these data do suggest is that the raised level of lactoferrin has not been able to lead to reduced systemic inflammation and this is in agreement with animal studies that have shown that the effects of lactoferrin were localized to the inflamed joint and do not extend to the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The association with the presence of RF in the serum is more intriguing. One possible explanation is that patients positive for RFs and thus a more serological disease would also have significant levels of immune complexes in their SF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Immune complexes can induce degranulation of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], which would then drive further release of lactoferrin in to the joint.</p><p>The ability of the iron chelators to enter neutrophils could determine their ability to chelate the intracellular labile iron pool and delay neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis. Desferrioxamine is a relatively small iron chelating molecule (656.8 Da) that has been shown to enter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and delay neutrophil apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Lactoferrin is a large biological iron-binding protein (78 000&#x02013;80 000 Da) that cannot enter cells by passive diffusion. Transferrin is also present in the rheumatoid synovium and has been shown to enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. However, transferrin receptors are expressed mainly on proliferating cells and mature neutrophils do not express this receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In contrast, neutrophils have been reported to express specific receptors for lactoferrin making receptor-mediated endocytosis possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, in contrast to transferrin, lactoferrin can bind iron at much lower pH, allowing lactoferrin function even within an acidic environment such as the endocytic vacuoles. Lactoferrin may therefore be the dominant functional iron chelator in RA SF.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings unveil a previously unrecognized effect of lactoferrin on neutrophil biology. We predict that lactoferrin could play a significant role in the regulation of neutrophil apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic>. High concentrations of lactoferrin have been found in the rheumatoid joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], which might contribute to a lack of apoptotic neutrophils in SF of patients with long-standing disease. However, the iron saturation state of lactoferrin at the site of inflammation will determine outcome and we propose that its use clinically should be considered only for septic arthritis in which extension of neutrophil lifespan could enhance the microbicidal efficacy of infiltrating neutrophils.</p><p><inline-graphic
