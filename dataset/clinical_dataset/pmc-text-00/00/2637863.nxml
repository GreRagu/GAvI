Despite their established role as the major neuronal precursors in the cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], two fundamental aspects of RG development and function remain contested. The first regards the question of whether, similar to the situation in cortex, RG function as the principal neuronal progenitors in all CNS regions. This question has been addressed with Cre/<italic>loxP </italic>lineage tracing using two different RG-specific promoters, the mouse brain lipid binding protein (<italic>Blbp</italic>) promoter and the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (<italic>hGFAP</italic>) promoter. However, sharply different patterns of recombination were driven by each promoter, prompting two distinct models for the RG role in neurogenesis. As significant neuronal recombination was detected in only a subset of brain regions when the <italic>hGFAP </italic>promoter was used to drive Cre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], it was proposed that RG differ regionally in terms of their neurogenic potential and generate neurons only in certain brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast, the extensive recombination driven in all brain regions by the <italic>Blbp </italic>promoter supported an alternative model in which essentially all RG populations are neurogenic and generate most neurons in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Each model has different implications not only for RG function but also the larger issue of the mechanisms used to generate neurons during development. An accurate picture of lineal relationships within the developing brain is, therefore, essential but the controversy surrounding the RG contribution to neurogenesis has remained unresolved.</p><p>A second related issue of contention concerns the question of when cells with the molecular properties of RG first appear in the CNS. Resolution of this question is necessary as elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for driving RG differentiation requires analysis of the relevant pathways when they first become active, not at later stages when the end products of these programs become morphologically evident. Two different estimates for the time point when induction of RG differentiation occurs in the murine forebrain have been proposed based on Cre/<italic>loxP </italic>lineage tracing results (used to indicate onset of transcription). Whereas the mouse <italic>Blbp </italic>promoter drove recombination from embryonic day (E)10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], the <italic>hGFAP </italic>promoter is not active until after E12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These contrasting results have been alternatively proposed to reflect either precocious or delayed activity of the <italic>Blbp </italic>or <italic>hGFAP </italic>promoters, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], but neither direct evidence supporting either model nor data obtained using an independent RG promoter has yet been reported.</p><p>A third deficiency in the current understanding of RG development is the inability to distinguish RG at distinct stages of maturation. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that RG populations progress stepwise through distinct developmental stages during which particular classes of neurons or glia are generated, and that progression to successively later stages is accompanied by restricted potential to produce earlier cell types. For example, cortical RG stop generating neurons at late stages of embryogenesis and transform into astrocytes postnatally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Determination of the precise time points when such transitions occur using <italic>in vivo </italic>genetic lineage tracing is a prerequisite to the identification of mechanisms regulating shifts in neurogenic potential; to date, few such studies have been conducted focusing on RG.</p><p>We report here that: similar to what was observed using the <italic>Blbp </italic>promoter for lineage tracing, RG expressing the glial high affinity glutamate transporter (<italic>Glast, a universally accepted RG marker </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]) are molecularly detectable in the forebrain by E10 and generate most neurons in the brain; <italic>hGFAP </italic>promoter activity is poorly correlated with RG differentiation in multiple brain regions, failing to drive recombination until days after RG first appear; and in ventral telencephalon, <italic>hGFAP </italic>activity commences after RG are predominantly gliogenic, genetically distinguishing an early neurogenic <italic>Blbp</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Glast</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>hGFAP</italic><sup>- </sup>stage from a later gliogenic <italic>Blbp</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Glast</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>hGFAP</italic><sup>+ </sup>stage in this region.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Endogenous GLAST expression and recombination in <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre;R26R mice are detected in the forebrain from E10.5</title><p>Due to the discrepant results previously obtained using the <italic>hGFAP </italic>and <italic>Blbp </italic>promoters, we performed Cre/<italic>loxP </italic>lineage tracing using the <italic>Glast </italic>promoter to drive Cre expression. Like <italic>Blbp</italic>, <italic>Glast </italic>expression is restricted to RG and astrocytes and molecularly distinguishes them from developmentally earlier neuroepithelial stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. To generate mice expressing Cre under the regulation of the <italic>Glast </italic>promoter, we inserted a Cre-polyA cassette into the second exon of the <italic>Glast </italic>gene in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and generated BAC transgenic mice. Five separate <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre founder lines were obtained, all of which yielded similar results when used for lineage tracing; representative results from one line are presented.</p><p>Specificity of the <italic>Glast </italic>BAC was confirmed using <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (ISH) and immunofluorescent staining. Cre mRNA was detected in ventricular zone (VZ) cells throughout the embryonic CNS and closely paralleled endogenous <italic>Glast </italic>expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a&#x02013;d</xref>). Importantly, all <italic>Glast</italic>-expressing regions contained Cre mRNA and regions known to differentially express GLAST showed similar Cre mRNA gradients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c,r</xref>). Postnatally, Cre protein was absolutely restricted to astroglial cells in all brain regions examined; no colocalization with neuronal markers was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e&#x02013;i</xref>). To confirm that the <italic>Glast </italic>BAC drives specific expression in all GLAST<sup>+ </sup>RG, <italic>Glast</italic>::eGFP transgenics using the same BAC vector and marker insertion locus were analyzed. Immunostaining demonstrated specific enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) expression in the majority of GLAST<sup>+ </sup>RG and astrocytes, endogenous GLAST gradients were faithfully recapitulated, and no neuronal expression was detectable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1j&#x02013;v</xref>). Taken together, these data establish that the <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre transgene drives RG- and astroglial-specific expression and can be used to trace the neuronal progeny of all <italic>Glast</italic>-expressing progenitors in the brain. It should be noted however that BAC-driven expression was absent from the spinal cord floorplate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1r&#x02013;t</xref>); as such, progeny derived from floorplate <italic>Glast</italic><sup>+ </sup>progenitors can not be traced in these mice.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Glast </italic>bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice recapitulate the spatiotemporal pattern of endogenous GLAST (glial high affinity glutamate transporter) expression.</bold> (e-v") <italic>In situ </italic>hybridization (ISH) (a-d) and immunofluorescent staining (e-v) of <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre (a-i) and <italic>Glast</italic>::eGFP (j-v) BAC transgenic mice.

This information is also relevant for defining the timing of the neuroepithelial stem cell (NE) to RG developmental transition, marked by the presence in the latter of 'astroglial' characteristics. These have been defined as molecular features unique to astroglial cells in the postnatal brain and are proposed to include BLBP and GLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We therefore stained embryonic sections to determine when these three 'astroglial' molecules first become detectable in the forebrain. At E9.5, neither GLAST nor BLBP could be detected in the forebrain whereas both were highly expressed in the hindbrain at this age (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a,c</xref>). By E10.5, both molecules were present in the forebrain and both exhibited similar higher-rostral, lower-caudal gradients of expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b,d</xref>). Furthermore, double labeling confirmed that both molecules are induced in the same cellular population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e,f</xref>). These results demonstrate that cells with the molecular characteristics of RG are present in the forebrain by E10.5.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Recombination in <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre;R26R embryos parallels endogenous GLAST (glial high affinity glutamate transporter) expression and the pattern observed in <italic>Blbp</italic>::Cre;R26R embryos.</bold> (a-q) Wild-type (a-f), <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre;R26R<sup>lacZ </sup>(g-m) and <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre;Z/EG (n-q) embryos immunostained for GLAST (a,b,e,f,k,l), BLBP (c-f), phosphorylated histone H3 (PH3) (n,o,q) or GFP (p,q) and X-gal staining (g-j,k',l',m'). Sections in (a-j) are sagittal; (k-q) are coronal. At E9.5, endogenous GLAST (a) and BLBP (c) expression was detected in hindbrain and spinal cord, but not in telencephalon until E10.5 (b,d). Double labeling for GLAST (red) and BLBP (green) in E10.5 CX and GE confirmed that both are upregulated in the same cells (e,f). The onset of Cre recombination matched the spatiotemporal pattern of endogenous GLAST expression, with minimal &#x003b2;-Gal activity in E9.5 telencephalon (g,h) but extensive staining by E10.5 (i,j); this pattern matches that previously reported for <italic>Blbp</italic>::Cre;R26R embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Concordance between &#x003b2; Gal activity and GLAST<sup>+ </sup>RG was consistently observed. At E12.5, GLAST is weak in septum (k'), and recombination in this region was similarly minimal (k). Conversely, GLAST and recombination are intense in the cortical hem (arrow in (l); higher magnification image of GLAST hem staining in (l')). Further, both Cre mRNA  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>) and recombination (m) in the spinal cord matched the dorsoventral gradient of endogenous GLAST in this region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1r</xref>).

Histochemical staining of <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre;R26R embryos demonstrated a tight concordance between the onset of recombination and onset of endogenous GLAST expression, with &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity and GLAST protein both becoming detectable in the forebrain at E10.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a,b,g&#x02013;j</xref>). Importantly, this spatiotemporal pattern of recombination also matches what was observed in <italic>Blbp</italic>::Cre;R26R embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The fact that both endogenous expression and recombination driven by the promoters of two different RG genes are so similar strongly suggests that the NE&#x02192;RG transition occurs between E9.5 and E10.5 in the forebrain. It should also be noted that the timing of recombination in <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre;R26R and <italic>Blbp</italic>::Cre;R26R embryos sharply contrasts with that driven by the neuroepithelial cell marker <italic>Nestin</italic>, as recombination in <italic>Nestin</italic>::Cre;R26R embryos is readily detectable throughout the CNS by E8.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, the data together provide both molecular and genetic evidence for the existence of a developmental transition that occurs by E10.5 in the forebrain, consisting of an earlier <italic>Nestin</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Blbp</italic><sup>-</sup><italic>Glast</italic><sup>- </sup>NE stage and a later <italic>Nestin</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Blbp</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Glast</italic><sup>+ </sup>RG stage. Analysis of recombination in <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre;R26R embryos at later time points showed a similarly tight concordance between GLAST expression and recombination (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2k&#x02013;m</xref>), providing further support for the specificity of the <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre transgene and for the validity of the lineage tracing results.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Glast</italic><sup>+ </sup>RG generate neurons throughout the brain</title><p>Adult <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre;R26R mice were analyzed to identify neurons derived from <italic>Glast</italic><sup>+ </sup>RG. For comparative purposes, we also examined recombination in <italic>hGFAP</italic>::Cre;R26R mice using the identical <italic>hGFAP</italic>::Cre transgenic line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] as the Malatesta study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Similar to previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], very few recombined neurons were observed in <italic>hGFAP</italic>::Cre;R26R mice in the ventral telencephalon, diencephalon or midbrain, and cerebellar Purkinje neurons were unrecombined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a,f,k</xref>). In contrast, recombination in <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre;R26R mice was extensive in all of these brain areas (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b,g,l</xref>). Moreover, NeuN/&#x003b2; gal double labeling demonstrated that most neurons in these regions were recombined and, therefore, radial glial-derived (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c&#x02013;d,h&#x02013;j,m&#x02013;o</xref>). As the <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre;R26R and <italic>Blbp</italic>::Cre;R26R tracing results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] are essentially the same, these data establish that RG in all brain regions transit through a neurogenic stage of development and generate most neurons in the brain.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Glast</italic><sup>+ </sup>radial glia generate the majority of neurons in the brain.</bold> (a-o) X-gal histochemical staining for &#x003b2;-gal activity (a,b,f,g,k,l) and immunofluorescent staining for NeuN (red) (c,e,h,j), &#x003b2;-galactosidase (green; d,e,i,j,n,o) and Calbindin (red) (m,o) in <italic>hGFAP</italic>::Cre;R26R (a,f,k) or <italic>Glast</italic>::Cre;R26R (b-e,g-j,l-o) adult mice.

In contrast to the Blbp and Glast promoters, the hGFAP promoter is not active in forebrain prior to E12.5 (not shown). By E12.5, recombination is detected in cortical RG but absent from GE (a-c), thalamus (g,i) and cortical hem (j,l). Importantly, both BLBP (not shown) and GLAST (d-f,h,k,l) are highly expressed in these regions. Moreover, these unrecombined cells have molecular and morphological properties of fully differentiated RG cells (e.g. long radial processes coursing from VZ to pia). Even as late as E14.5, few GE RG are recombined (m,n), and significant recombination is not observed until E15.5 (o) when most RG in the region have completed neurogenesis. hGFAP promoter activity itself is not only delayed with respect to RG differentiation, but also weak ventrally compared to its dorsal activity (p,q,r).

Taken together, these results establish that <italic>hGFAP </italic>promoter activity is poorly correlated with RG differentiation in multiple brain regions, requiring several days after endogenous RG markers are first induced before becoming active. Direct examination of <italic>hGFAP </italic>promoter activity further illustrated this point: even though some expression can be detected in the E14.5 GE, significantly higher expression was observed in the cortex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4p,q</xref>). Moreover, weak ventral expression persisted as late as E16.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4r</xref>). This is the opposite of the endogenous RG markers BLBP and GLAST, which are more highly expressed ventrally at E14.5 and roughly equivalent at E16.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and further demonstrates that the <italic>hGFAP </italic>promoter does not accurately reflect normal characteristics of RG development in mice. Lastly, we note that previous work showed that all GE <italic>hGFAP</italic><sup>+ </sup>RG are also GLAST<sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and that at E14.5 (when GE <italic>hGFAP</italic>-mediated recombination first occurs), all BLBP<sup>+ </sup>RG are also GLAST<sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thus, <italic>hGFAP </italic>does not define a unique BLBP<sup>-</sup>GLAST<sup>- </sup>population of radial glia.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have clarified and defined two major aspects of RG development and function. First, we have shown that cells with the molecular features of RG are present in the forebrain from E10.5, establishing that the NE&#x02192;RG transition commences in this region between E9.5 and E10.5. Second, we have solidified the concept that RG are the primary neuronal progenitors in the developing brain by showing that: most neurons in the brain are derived from <italic>Glast</italic><sup>+ </sup>RG; and in multiple brain regions, the heterologous <italic>hGFAP </italic>promoter is not active until several days after morphologically and molecularly defined RG first appear. Thus, the limited neuronal recombination driven by the <italic>hGFAP </italic>promoter is not indicative of regionally restricted potential as proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] but rather a result of delayed <italic>hGFAP </italic>activity in certain RG populations.</p><p>As the recombination observed in Cre/<italic>loxP </italic>tracing reflects transcriptional activity of the promoter driving Cre, lineages can be traced from the time points when the molecular programs responsible for inducing promoter activity first become active. Results using endogenous mouse RG promoters such as <italic>Blbp </italic>and <italic>Glast </italic>therefore record lineages from the time when cells first become molecularly distinguishable as RG. The validity of this approach has been questioned by the suggestion that the presence of both molecular and morphological features are required in order to define cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, this idea does not take into account the fact that molecular changes necessarily precede and drive subsequent morphological changes. For example, the transcription factor <italic>Hb9 </italic>is required for normal specification of spinal cord motoneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and ectopic <italic>Hb9 </italic>expression is sufficient to induce motoneuron fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, axon extension and innervation of skeletal muscle are not observed until at least one day after <italic>Hb9 </italic>transcription is induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, although the presence of distinct morphology can allow cell types to be positively identified, their absence does not exclude a given identity during development since many morphological characteristics of differentiated cells appear only after the required molecular changes take place.</p><p>In addition to such reasoning, several lines of evidence support the idea that the NE&#x02192;RG transition occurs in the forebrain by E10. First, expression of both <italic>Blbp </italic>and <italic>Glast </italic>becomes detectable in the forebrain by this time (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>); thus, two different RG genes are induced at the same time. Second, Notch signaling promotes the RG phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and <italic>Blbp </italic>is a direct Notch target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; therefore, induction of <italic>Blbp </italic>expression indicates that Notch-dependent RG differentiation has occurred. Finally, mice lacking <italic>ErbB2</italic>, a gene required for RG differentiation, begin showing impaired RC2 labeling in the telencephalon from as early as E9.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] (some recombination restricted to the most rostral portion of the forebrain was detectable in E9.5 <italic>Blbp</italic>::Cre;R26R embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the molecular programs responsible for triggering RG differentiation are already active in some forebrain regions by E9.5 and induce broad expression of RG target genes by E10.5. They further suggest that an understanding of the mechanisms regulating the NE&#x02192;RG transition will require analysis of molecular events occurring between these time points.</p><p>An important technical issue regarding Cre/<italic>loxP </italic>lineage tracing is that recombination efficiency is directly dependent upon cellular recombinase concentrations; this point must be considered when comparing results obtained using distinct transgenic or targeted lines. For instance, when four different promoters of varying strengths were used to drive Cre and compared in embryonic stem cells, recombination efficiency was directly correlated with promoter activity: the strongest promoter drove the highest levels of recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Furthermore, even when the identical promoter is used, recombination efficiency can vary dramatically according to copy number. For example, merely doubling the copy number of a <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic>::Cre transgene (from one to two copies) resulted in a 10-fold increase in the number of recombined cells in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For these reasons, caution must be used when interpreting negative results in lineage tracing experiments as a lack of recombination could reflect weak promoter activity rather than restricted progenitor potential. Indeed, differences in copy number likely explain why subsequently generated <italic>hGFAP</italic>::Cre transgenic lines yielded higher levels of neuronal recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] than observed using the original line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It will be important to keep these issues in mind when comparing lineage tracing results in which the same genomic locus was either targeted (that is, knockin) or used as a transgene. Whereas knockins can, at most, provide two targeted alleles, tens to hundreds of copies are typical for transgenics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, in many cases, transgenics may be more likely than knockins to drive recombination at the time when transcription commences and consequently should give a more accurate picture of the progeny derived from a given molecularly defined progenitor population.</p><p>Although the onset of <italic>Blbp </italic>and <italic>Glast </italic>transcription distinguishes RG from <italic>nestin</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Blbp</italic><sup>-</sup><italic>Glast</italic><sup>- </sup>NE, the available evidence indicates that, as a population, <italic>Blbp</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Glast</italic><sup>+ </sup>RG themselves transit through multiple distinct developmental stages. For example, the <italic>hGFAP </italic>promoter does not drive any recombination in cortex prior to E12.5 (data not shown). As rodent <italic>Gfap </italic>is not normally expressed so early in RG neurogenesis, it is possible that the timing of <italic>hGFAP </italic>activity in mice merely reflects the peculiarities of a heterologous promoter. However, it is alternatively possible that a fundamental transition occurring at E12.5 upregulates <italic>hGFAP </italic>activity; if so, the latter stage might represent the terminal phase of RG generation of layer VIb neurons as only about 30% of these neurons were recombined in <italic>hGFAP</italic>::Cre;R26R mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is also well known that RG ultimately cease generating neurons and switch to production of glia; although several pathways have been implicated in promoting gliogenesis (for example, Jak-STAT signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and NFI genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]), a comprehensive description of the mechanisms involved is lacking and requires transcriptional profiling and comparisons between neurogenic and gliogenic RG. Steps in this direction have been taken by transcriptome analyses of FACS purified RG whose neurogenic potential was determined by <italic>in vitro </italic>clonal analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, given that progenitor neurogenic potential <italic>in vivo </italic>can differ from that observed <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], subsequent studies might yield additional insights by defining potential on the basis of either <italic>in vivo </italic>transplantation or genetic lineage tracing. Accordingly, our lineage tracing data provide <italic>in vivo </italic>evidence that <italic>hGFAP </italic>promoter activity commences in ventral telencephalic RG only after neurogenesis is largely completed and thus distinguishes a later <italic>Blbp</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Glast</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>hGFAP</italic><sup>+ </sup>gliogenic stage from an earlier <italic>Blbp</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Glast</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>hGFAP</italic><sup>-</sup>neurogenic stage in this region. This is significant as it enables direct <italic>in vivo </italic>comparisons of neurogenic and gliogenic ventral telencephalic RG via FACS purification and microarray analyses using <italic>hGFAP</italic>::eGFP and <italic>Blbp</italic>::eGFP or <italic>Glast</italic>::eGFP transgenic mice. Such studies should facilitate efforts to more thoroughly determine the molecular mechanisms that control progenitor potential and fate specification.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data establish the major neurogenic role of RG in the developing CNS and genetically distinguish an early neurogenic <italic>Blbp</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Glast</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>hGFAP</italic><sup>- </sup>stage from a later gliogenic <italic>Blbp</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Glast</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>hGFAP</italic><sup>+ </sup>stage in the ventral telencephalon.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice and BAC transgenesis</title><p>All protocols were approved by the Rockefeller University IACUC. <italic>Glast</italic>::<italic>Cre </italic>BAC transgenic mice were generated using homologous recombination to insert a Cre-SV40polyA cassette at the site of the endogenous ATG (exon II, BAC clone RP23-63O21).
