Introduction</title><p>It has been recognised that cancer	survival in the UK has lagged behind the USA and other European countries. This recognition triggered the Calman-Hine reportin the mid 1990s, which started a major reorganisation of cancer services inthe UK. In 1998, the NHS executive  published guidance on Improving Outcomes in LungCancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. One aspect ofthis guidance examined was the effectiveness of multidisciplinary teams (MDTs)and supported the recommendation that all patients with lung cancer have theircase reviewed by a specialist MDT and targeted investment was made to developteam working. In 2000, the NHS cancer plan looked to introduce more radicalchanges and cover the whole cancer care pathway. This led to significantinvestment aimed at reducing waiting times and improving access to treatment.</p><p>The Doncaster lung cancer MDT was set upand in 1997 started to review the management of all patients with lung cancerwho presented to three district general hospitalsthat cover a population of 450000 patients in South Yorkshire and North Nottinghamshire . From the outset, a database was designed to prospectively record data for all patients reviewed by the MDT andincluded demographic, staging, and treatment details. The MDT has now beenoperational for 10 years and we have started to review our experience over thattime particularly looking to document the trends in treatment and outcome thathave occurred during this period of cancer service reorganisation in the UK.</p><p>This paper has looked specifically atpatients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) which compromises approximately 20%of all cases of lung cancer. The disease is characterised by early metastaticspread, sensitivity to chemotherapy, and early development of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Untreated the median survival in limited stage is 3 months, and in extensivestage 1.5 months. With single-agent chemotherapy, trials indicate a mediansurvival of 6 and 4 months and with combination chemotherapy, 10&#x02013;20 and 7&#x02013;11 months,respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Improving outcomes in lung cancer,published in 1998, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] reviewed the researchevidence and recommended the use of combination chemotherapy. This guidance wasable to suggest an optimal duration of chemotherapy but concluded there waslittle clear evidence to guide the choice of drugs. The guidance also feltthere was sufficient evidence to support the use of thoracic radiotherapy andprophylactic cranial irradiation in limited stage disease. The NationalInstitute for Clinical Excellence commissioned an update, which was publishedas the &#x0201c;The Diagnosis and Treatment of Lung Cancer Guidelines&#x0201d; in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Thisguidance built on the previous recommendation indicating the superiority ofplatinum-based chemotherapy as first line treatment and indicating a role for secondline treatment in selected patients. No new recommendations were made forradiotherapy, though its timing and sequencing with chemotherapy wasdiscussed.</p><p>Therefore, we have chosen to study thewhole population of patients with SCLC presenting to our MDT and audit thechanges in treatment practice that have occurred between 1998 and 2005 andmonitored the effect that the investment made following the NHS cancer plan hashad an outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><p>The MDT database has prospectively recordedall patients with a histological or radiological diagnosis of lung cancer sincethe Doncaster Lung cancer MDT was formed. This database has been used toidentify all patients with a confirmed histological diagnosis of SCLC betweenJanuary 1998 and December 2005. The demographic and treatment data on thedatabase, supplemented by information from the patient records, has beenanonymised and subjected to statistical analysis. To examine for time trends wedivided patients into 3 chronological groups (1998&#x02013;2000, 2001-2002, and 2003&#x02013;2005) eachcontaining approximately 80 patients. Kaplan Myer survival analysis wasperformed using SPSS statistical package version 12.0.1.</p><sec id="subsec2.1"><title>2.1. Patients Characteristics</title><p>Two hundreds and thirty five patients withSCLC were identified; 120 (51%) females and 115 (49%) males. The median age was66 years (range 25&#x02013;87), there were83 patients (35%) &#x02265;70 years old at the time of diagnosis. A histologicaldiagnosis was made at flexible bronchoscopy in 83%, the remaining 17% required fineneedle aspiration for cytology or CT guided biopsy.</p><p>110 patients had a performance status of 0or 1 at diagnosis and staging investigations showed 112 patients had limitedstage disease confined to the ipislateral lung and mediastinum. Applying the Manchester  prognostic scoringsystem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], 91 patients (39%) fell into the good prognosis category, 122 (52%)the intermediate, and 22 (9%) were in the poor prognosis group.</p><p>We analysed the time from GP referral to startingdefinitive treatment as a measure of the early diagnostic part of the patientpathway. The duration was shortest between 2003&#x02013;2005 compared tothose of 2001-2002 and 1998&#x02013;2000 (mean 27, 37,and 34 days and median of 26, 33, and 31 days, resp.) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001 using one way ANOVA test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>, the patient characteristicsand treatment outcome are summarised and  broken down into the threechronological groups. For 83% of patients the initial treatment waschemotherapy. The table also shows that anthracycline-based chemotherapy was mostcommonly used overall, though over the study period there was increasing use ofplatinum-based treatment, which became the most commonly used treatment in thelast three years of the study. The median number of chemotherapy cycles given was6 (range 1&#x02013;6) and seventeenpatients received chemotherapy as part of ongoing clinical trials.</p><p>The table also indicates that the use ofradiotherapy was constant over the study period. Around 5% of patients receivedradiotherapy as initial palliative treatment and in a further 18% it was usedto palliate symptoms later in the course of the disease. Consolidation thoracicradiotherapy (TRT) was given in 42% of patients who had shown a response to theinitial chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was given to 24%of patients who presented with limited stage disease and responded tochemotherapy or were treated in the trial setting.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec3"><title>3.

There was an overall response rate was 77% (24% CR and 53%PR) with only 6% having documented progressed during chemotherapy. We found ahigher response rate for patients with limited disease, performance status 0/1,and those less than 70 years old but none reached statistical significance (usingchi-square test, <italic>P</italic>-values were 0.090, 0.390, 0.702, resp.). Therewas higher response rate with platinum-based treatments (87%) compared anthracycline(78%). The high response rate for platinum-based treatment includes patients inthe poor prognostic group, particularly those with impaired hepatic function,in whom single-agent carboplatin was used and had a response rate of 50%.</p></sec><sec id="subsec3.2"><title>3.2.

Discussion</title><p>The Doncaster MDT serves an area withsignificantly higher rates of lung cancer incidence and mortality than thenational average; the indirectly standardised registration rate (SRR) (2001&#x02013;2003)for Doncaster was 138 for men and 140 forwomen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Overall thestandardised mortality ratios (SMR) in Doncaster area were 114, 112 for malesand females, respectively, which  are among the highest SMR in England and Wales  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This indicates a poor general healthstatus for the population in the Doncaster area,  which would be expected to have an effect on outcome following adiagnosis of small-cell lung cancer in various ways. Our population of patientswith SCLC will be different to the population of patients entering the trialsthat provides our evidence base. An example would be a comparison of our demographicswith the Norwegian Lung Cancer Study Group Trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which reported in the middle of our study period and has relativelywide entry criteria that included limited and extensive disease. The age,performance status, and stage of our patients are similar to those included inthe trial but we note we treated a significantly higher proportion of femalepatients (51 vs. 36%) with worse performance status (PS 0/1 47% vs. 65%).</p><p>The treatment response rates documented inthis study are comparable to those reported in trials, but these trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]have reported better survival outcomes. The Norwegian study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], for example, comparedanthracycline and platinum-based chemotherapy and demonstrated a survivaladvantage in favour of the platinum-based treatment (median survival 7.8 vs. 10.2) months. Although the entry criteria for this study were relatively broad,our population included a number of patients who would not meet the trialinclusion criteria, the biggest group being the 17% of our patients who werenot considered fit for primary chemotherapy treatment.</p><p>The national LUCADA database hasbeen developed to collect more detailed demographic information on patientswith lung cancer, to allow adjustments for comorbidity and other factors to bemade when comparing outcome across England and Wales  and has published its first report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] withcoverage extending to the majority of the population. The data collected bythis report covers a different, but overlapping, period to our audit and comparisonsuggests the median survival reported in our series is a typical outcome for UK  asa whole (6 vs. 5.6 months), using current guidelines. During the period of our audit,our unit reached the current national guidance recommendations with 100% ofpatients being reviewed by the MDT and histological confirmation rate of 83% andthis compares favourable with the LUCADA averagesin 2005 of 78% and 65%, respectively. In addition, treatment rates compare favourably,83% of our patients received chemotherapy; the LUCADA average being 54%. Therefore,with median age, sex ratio, performance status, stage of disease, andcomorbidities being similar, we are disappointed that at best we demonstrate amarginal improvement in the median survival of our patients with SCLC (6months) compared to LUCADA report (5.6 months).</p><p>Over the 8-year study period therewere no significant demographic changes, though we did notice a trend towards ahigher female incidence and extensive stage disease at initial presentation, thelatter probably reflecting increased accuracy of staging with the increased useof CT scanning. During the audit period there was accumulating evidenceindicating the superiority of platinum-based treatment over anthracyclines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This was reflected in the guidelines published in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and ourpractice with a clear trend towards the increased use of platinum treatment inthe third cohort of patients. There was no change in the guideline advice onthe use of radiotherapy over the study period as the evidence demonstrating thebenefit of thoracic radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and prophylactic cranial irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] had accumulated during the 1990s and was being applied atthe start of the audit period. There was no change in the proportion ofpatients receiving radiotherapy over time, though from 2003 we did participatein a study of PCI in extensive stage patients and considered concurrent ratherthan sequential thoracic radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The changes in treatment practice that have occurred over the 8 years havebeen small; so perhaps it is unsurprising that they have not fed through to anymeasurable effect on outcome for the total population with small-cell lungcancer. However, the bigger changes thatoccurred during our audit period were driven by the NHS cancer plan, whichrevolutionised the delivery of cancer treatment across the UK. The planfocused attention on target times for access, diagnosis, and waiting times, andsignificant investment was made to reduce the intervals between referral, firsthospital appointment and treatment. These targets are now being met for 96&#x02013;99% of cancerpatients and this audit was able to document an improvement in the patientpathway. Comparing in 1998&#x02013;2000with 2003&#x02013;2005 there was  a reduction in themean time from GP referral to a management plan being agreed (from 31 to 18 days)  andin the mean time from referral to initial treatment(from 34 days 27 days). The disappointment is that we are unable todocument any significant improvement in outcome tocorrespond with this improvement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>We feel that these data reflect theevolution of evidence-based treatment, delivered to an unselected cohort ofpatients presenting to a single cancer unit. Disappointingly, we could notdocument any significant improvement in outcome for patients over the 8-yearaudit period. It remains difficult to translate the survival benefits reportedin trials. We feel that improvements in outcome will only come with earlierdiagnosis and improvements in the general health of our population.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="other"><article-title>Improving outcomes in lung cancer; the research evidence</article-title><comment>NHS Executive, London, 1998</comment></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Buccheri</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferrigno</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prognostic factors of small cell lung cancer</article-title><source><italic>Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America</italic></source><year>2004</year><volume>18</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>445</fpage><lpage>460</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15094181</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Morstyn</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Ihde</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Lichter</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Small cell lung cancer 1973&#x02013;1983: early progress and recent obstacles</article-title><source><italic>International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics</italic></source><year>1984</year><volume>10</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>515</fpage><lpage>539</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Turrisi</surname><given-names>AT</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Blum</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Twice-daily compared with once-daily thoracic radiotherapy in limited small-cell lung cancer treated concurrently with cisplatin and etoposide</article-title><source><italic>The New England Journal of Medicine</italic></source><year>1999</year><volume>340</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>265</fpage><lpage>271</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9920950</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chrystal</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheong</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chemotherapy of small cell lung cancer: state of the art</article-title><source><italic>Current Opinion in Oncology</italic></source><year>2004</year><volume>16</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>136</fpage><lpage>140</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15075905</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B6"><label>6</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hoffman</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name><name><surname>Mauer</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Vokes</surname><given-names>EE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Lung cancer</article-title><source><italic>The Lancet</italic></source><year>2000</year><volume>355</volume><issue>9202</issue><fpage>479</fpage><lpage>485</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="B7"><label>7</label><citation citation-type="other"><collab>National Collaborating Centre for Acute Care</collab><article-title>The diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer; methods, evidence and guidance</article-title><comment>London, February 2005, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcseng.ac.uk">http://www.rcseng.ac.uk</ext-link></comment></citation></ref><ref id="B8"><label>8</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cerny</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Blair</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Bramwell</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Thatcher</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pretreatment prognostic factors and scoring system in 407 small-cell lung cancer patients</article-title><source><italic>International Journal of Cancer</italic></source><year>1987</year><volume>39</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>146</fpage><lpage>149</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="B9"><label>9</label><citation citation-type="other"><collab>National Centre For Health Outcomes Development</collab><comment>Clinical and Health Outcomes Knowledge base.
