With the advent of &#x0201c;short course chemotherapy&#x0201d; in the 1980s, the duration of treatment fell from 24 to six months, but even then full adherence to treatment regimens has been difficult to accomplish, due to the extensive length of therapy necessary to achieve cure. The prevalence of TB resistant to a single drug was continuously on the rise in several parts of the world, and eventually in the early 1990s, multiple converging factors led to an explosive emergence of MDR-TB, defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line anti-TB agents, isoniazid and rifampicin.</p><p>The most recent estimates on the prevalence of anti-TB drug resistance come from surveys conducted by the World Health Organization and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease.

In addition, since 2002, 45 countries have reported cases of XDR-TB, i.e., TB that is resistant not only to isoniazid and rifampicin but also to at least one fluoroquinolone and to any of the following injectable second-line drugs: kanamycin, amikacin, or capreomycin.

Since the early 1990s, numerous studies have described the genetic mechanisms of drug resistance in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content>, and a wealth of data has accumulated on the mutations found in isolates resistant to specific drugs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. For some drugs, like isoniazid and rifampicin, a large number of mutations have been identified that confer resistance, and these mutations account for most of the resistance found among clinical isolates. For other drugs, such as streptomycin and many of the second-line drugs, known drug resistance mutations occur in only a small proportion of resistant isolates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. As resistance has become even more prevalent, and high-throughput sequencing methods and genotyping strategies have been developed and refined, large-scale studies to identify the mutations associated with resistance have been undertaken throughout the world. Until now, there has been no single resource where such drug resistance mutation data are readily available to use in research and development. In order to propel the use of the data that are scattered over a large number of publications, many of which are not readily accessible to researchers around the globe, we have compiled the data available on drug resistance mutations in <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> in an open-access database that can be used for a diverse array of purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Applications of the Database</title><p>Centralized databases, curated from the literature or high-throughput experiments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, have helped usher in the era of systems biology &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, and have helped researchers identify global trends and important biological features that would have only been apparent through a comprehensive analysis of the combined data &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

Through this project we present a new database devoted to drug resistance mutations in TB, called the TB Drug Resistance Mutation Database (TBDReaMDB). By providing a comprehensive, single resource of drug resistance mutations in TB, we hope to accelerate and encourage new discoveries that will have applications ranging from diagnostics to drug discovery. We envision that this database will expand as additional mutations are identified in the coming years and will serve as a platform for diverse analyses and projects. TBDReaMDB also complements other TB-related databases such as TBDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tbdb.org/">http://www.tbdb.org/</ext-link>), a recently developed Web-based resource housing both annotated genome sequence data and expression data from <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content> and related species &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Resource for sequencing projects.</title><p>The creation of this database was originally precipitated by our in-house need for information on known mutations found in drug-resistant TB, to be used in a large-scale whole-genome sequencing project of MDR- and XDR-TB strains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Whole-genome sequencing identifies a large number of mutations among isolates from diverse geographic regions that exhibit varying degrees of drug resistance. The data in the mutation database can be used to screen the mutations discovered by sequencing, thereby allowing the user to distinguish mutations and genes that previously have been associated with resistance from newly identified resistance-associated mutations, or random mutations that serve as markers of the genetic lineage of the particular strain.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Development of diagnostics.</title><p>New tools for rapid and accurate diagnosis of drug-resistant TB are urgently needed. Sequence-based diagnostic methods have been developed that detect specific mutations associated with drug resistance. These tools have the advantage of being rapid, high-throughput, and easily compared between laboratories. However, the development of such diagnostic tools relies on detailed information about the mutations that lead to drug resistance and their relative frequency. Currently the two main diagnostic tests available commercially are the INNO-LiPA TB test (Innogenetics) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; and the GenoType MTBDR<italic>plus</italic> kit (Hain Lifescience) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. These assays have recently been approved by the World Health Organization as a tool for rapid MDR-TB diagnosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. These &#x0201c;line probe assays&#x0201d; are based on the detection of a set number of mutations in a few genes associated with resistance against isoniazid and rifampicin. These assays may therefore be unable to detect all isoniazid and rifampicin resistance and do not detect resistance to other first-line or second-line drugs. This database project establishes a foundation that we hope will spur future development of assays with improved sensitivity and specificity and the expansion of these tools to detect resistance to other first- and second-line drugs. In addition, the data may also be used in future research to understand the clinical importance of rare mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Geographical distribution and surveillance of mutations.</title><p>Differences in the type and frequency of mutations in drug-resistant isolates in diverse geographical regions can pose challenges for the development of a sequence-based diagnostic, especially if the test relies on detecting a limited number of mutations. Different drugs of the same drug class may also interact differently with the molecular drug targets and thus affect the mutations selected for &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, some specific mutations have been shown to lead to high-level resistance, while others confer low-level resistance to a specific drug &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Others may lead to cross-resistance to drug analogs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Regional differences in drug analogs used have been shown to select for different drug resistance mutations; for example, mutations found in regions that use specific rifamycin analogs differ from those in which other analogs are used &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. The mutations that arise from these different drug analog exposures may help explain some of the reported geographical differences in drug efficacy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-1000002-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. We have therefore included the geographic sites of resistance studies in our database. As more data on the frequency of mutations become available through large-scale sequencing projects, we will garner an even more comprehensive understanding of the global distribution of specific mutations and a better perception of the role of geographical differences.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Drug discovery.</title><p>The database can also be used for novel computational technologies in drug discovery. Mutations may be mapped onto protein structures in order to better understand the mechanisms of resistance at the molecular and atomic level. Such analyses may help us to better understand how particular mutations lead to resistance, how mutations impact the affinity or activation of corresponding drugs, and how mutations may impact the fitness of the bacteria. Trends, such as correlated or synergistic mutations, may also become apparent through the comprehensive analysis of the data on mutations associated with resistance. In addition to revealing the mechanisms of resistance on a global scale, the resulting mapping of mutations may also suggest drug modifications or alternative strategies to counter emerging drug resistance in TB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>A New Comprehensive Database</title><p>TBDReaMDB is a comprehensive resource on drug resistance mutations in <named-content content-type="genus-species">M. tuberculosis</named-content>. We conducted a systematic review (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-1000002-sd001">Text S1</xref> for a brief description of the systematic review strategy) to identify drug resistance mutations from the existing literature to include in the database. We chose not to make any a priori decisions as to whether the mutations described in the literature actually confer drug resistance or are possible secondary compensatory mutations, but instead included all mutations that have been described in drug-resistant strains more often than drug-sensitive isolates. For each mutation, the database provides complete codon changes for each mutation at both the nucleotide and amino acid level.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Systematic compilation of mutations found in clinical isolates of drug-resistant TB.</title><p>The database is divided into two parts. The first part lists all the unique mutations reported in drug-resistant TB isolates, as well as information on the time period of isolate collection, country of origin, molecular detection method, resistance pattern, and susceptibility testing method. Since many of the mutations are reported in multiple publications, we included only the first report that identified a specific mutation. As of September 1, 2008, TBDReaMDB contains 946 unique mutations associated with seven different drug classes and spread over 36 genes, two intergenic/promoter regions, and one ribosomal RNA coding region.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Frequency of high-confidence mutations associated with drug resistance in TB.</title><p>The second part of the database provides data on the relative frequency of the most common mutations associated with resistance to specific drugs, as reported in surveys from diverse geographical sites. For each drug, we extracted data from ten high-quality publications that reported the frequency of mutations associated with resistance to that drug. In addition to the information about the frequency of specific mutations among resistant and sensitive isolates, we have also extracted the type of article-specific data, including time period of isolate collection and country of origin. Such frequency data might be useful for the design and validation of sequence-based diagnostic tools to estimate the number of genes or mutations needed to develop a sensitive and specific assay. These data may also serve as a baseline for surveillance of geographical and temporal trends in the prevalence of specific mutations, as well as for research on the implications of geographical differences in mutation frequencies for development of new diagnostic tools.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Open Access through an Interactive Web Site</title><p>We have created an interactive Web site that allows users to visualize all the specific mutations associated with resistance to each drug (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tbdreamdb.com/">http://www.tbdreamdb.com/</ext-link>).
