Transcript profiling has expanded the repertoire of these markers by providing the snapshot of cellular status that reflects the activity of all genes. However, such data have been used only to assess relative similarities and differences of these cells. Here we show that principal component analysis of global gene expression profiles map cells in multidimensional transcript profile space and the positions of differentiating cells progress in a stepwise manner along trajectories starting from undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells located in the apex. We present three &#x02018;cell lineage trajectories&#x02019;, which represent the differentiation of ES cells into the first three lineages in mammalian development: primitive endoderm, trophoblast and primitive ectoderm/neural ectoderm. The positions of the cells along these trajectories seem to reflect the developmental potency of cells and can be used as a scale for the potential of cells. Indeed, we show that embryonic germ cells and induced pluripotent cells are mapped near the origin of the trajectories, whereas mouse embryo fibroblast and fibroblast cell lines are mapped near the far end of the trajectories. We suggest that this method can be used as the non-operational semi-quantitative definition of cell differentiation status and developmental potency. Furthermore, the global expression profiles of cell lineages provide a framework for the future study of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> cell differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>embryonic stem</kwd><kwd>embryonic germ</kwd><kwd>induced pluripotent stem</kwd><kwd>mouse embryo fibroblast</kwd><kwd>embryonal carcinoma</kwd><kwd>retinoic acids</kwd><kwd>neural stem/progenitor</kwd><kwd>trophoblast stem</kwd><kwd>principal component analysis</kwd><kwd>leukemia inhibitory factor</kwd><kwd>epigenetic landscape</kwd><kwd>Waddington</kwd><kwd>developmental potency</kwd><kwd>cell lineage trajectory</kwd><kwd>gene expression profiling</kwd><kwd>DNA microarray analysis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Developmental biologists have long held a view that development naturally progresses from totipotent fertilized eggs with unlimited differentiation potential to terminally differentiated cells, like a ball rolling from high to low points on a slope as depicted in Waddington's epigenetic landscape.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN035C1">1</xref></sup> The epigenetic landscape also points to another important aspect of development, which is the emergence of different cell lineages during the development; cells in specific developmental lineages are thought to take discrete paths (&#x02018;chreodes&#x02019;) on the imaginary slope.

The first few PCs, which explain most of the observed variance, are the most important; the remaining PCs often represent random fluctuations. Therefore, by plotting data against the first two or three PCs, one can reduce the dimensionality of the data without losing much of information. Contribution of genes to each PC (which may be positive or negative) is determined by singular value decomposition algorithm applied to the covariance matrix. Knowing these contributions, the entire gene expression profile of a given cell type can be represented by a single point in a two- or three-dimensional space. If two cell types are represented by closely located points in the PCA plot, global gene expression profiles of these cells are very similar. In contrast, if corresponding points in the PCA plot are far apart, their global expression profiles are very different.

Although the hierarchical clustering analysis grouped cells mostly into each differentiation system (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F1">1</xref>A), it showed only the degree of similarity between different cell types and did not provide any insights into the relationship between the different cell lineages. To further analyze the data, we employed PCA, which can reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression profiles and map individual cells in a multidimensional space according to their global gene expression patterns (see Section 2.3 for the explanation of PCA). We first mapped the cells in the 3D transcript profile space (PC1, PC2 and PC3) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F1">1</xref>B). PCA of all these microarray data uncovered three major paths of differentiation from undifferentiated ES cells in 3D transcript profile space (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F1">1</xref>B; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn035/DC1">Supplementary Video S1</ext-link>). Each path showed progressive changes in global expression patterns toward specific cell lineages: trophectoderm (Z0&#x02013;Z5), extra-embryonic endoderm (G0&#x02013;G5; F0&#x02013;F5) and neural tissues (N0&#x02013;N6). We call these paths &#x02018;cell lineage trajectories,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN035C32">32</xref></sup>&#x02019; because the cell differentiation process can be visualized as a trajectory in the multidimensional transcript profile space.</p><p>What do these trajectories represent? Because the transcript profile space is constructed from the expression patterns of genes, the changes in gene expression patterns are reflected in the changes in the position of a cell. To find gene expression changes that are correlated with these trajectories, we first drew a line for each cell lineage so that the squared distances from the cells of the lineage were minimized. The locations of other cell types, such as TS and NS, were projected onto the closest lineage trajectory (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F1">1</xref>B). The <italic>x</italic>-axis of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F2">2</xref> shows the coordinates of these cell types on each trajectory (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F2">2</xref>A&#x02013;C). We then searched for sets of genes that were positively correlated with each trajectory line. We identified 1738 genes for the primitive endoderm lineage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F2">2</xref>A; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn035/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>), 2311 genes for the trophoblast lineage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F2">2</xref>B; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn035/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>) and 2463 genes for the primitive ectoderm/neural lineage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F2">2</xref>C; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn035/DC1">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>) with a correlation of &#x0003e;0.90. The expression levels of these genes gradually increased as ES cells differentiated into each lineage (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn035/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> for examples of gene expression changes).

Taken together, these data support the notion that cell differentiation can be visualized as cell lineage trajectories in 3D transcript profile space.</p><p>We also noticed that these cell lineage trajectories represent the gradual loss of developmental potency or potential of cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F1">1</xref>B). To examine this point further, we carried out microarray analysis of 12 additional cell types, including three undifferentiated ES cell lines (MC1, derived from 129S6/SvEvTac; MC2, derived from C57BL/6J; D3_GL; and EBRTcH3) and two undifferentiated EG cell lines [TGC8.5_5, derived from the primordial germ cell (PGC) of E8.5 C57BL/6J embryo; and EG1, derived from the PGC of E9 129 embryo].<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN035C24">24</xref></sup> We also analyzed the expression profiles of MEF cells, stromal cells (STO) and a fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3). We then analyzed iPS cells, which have been established by infecting MEFs with retroviruses carrying expression cassettes for four genes (<italic>Myc</italic>, <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN035C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN035C28">28</xref></sup> We used two different iPS lines: one was established by using Fbxo15 promoter-driven GFP as an indicator of pluripotency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN035C6">6</xref></sup> and the other was established by using Nanog promoter-GFP as an indicator of pluripotency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN035C28">28</xref></sup></p><p>Hierarchical clustering analysis of the microarray data of all 44 cell types (original 32 cell types and 12 additional cell types; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn035/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> for detail) showed that undifferentiated ES and EG cells were clustered together with iPS cells, whereas NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, STO stromal cells and MEF cells were clustered together (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F3">3</xref>A). However, it was difficult to assess the overall relationship among all the cell types analyzed here. We, therefore, analyzed the microarray data of all 44 cell types by PCA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F3">3</xref>B; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn035/DC1">Supplementary Video S2</ext-link>). Interestingly, an overall structure of the transcript profile space remained essentially the same as that obtained by 32 cell types (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F1">1</xref>B). The majority of the cells were aligned along the three major cell lineage trajectories, except for fibroblast and stromal cells (NIH3T3, STO and MEFs). The fact that these cells did not fall into any of the three cell lineage trajectories is consistent with their mesodermal origin. Their locations near the bottom of all three trajectory lines also support the general trend that these cell lineage trajectories represent the gradual loss of developmental potency of cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F1">1</xref>B). Indeed, undifferentiated ES and EG cells mapped near the apex of the trajectory figures, as expected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F3">3</xref>B). Similarly, the iPS cells mapped near the apex of the trajectories. It has been demonstrated that these iPS cells have the complete phenotype of pluripotent cells, including germline competency in the case of iPS-Nanog.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN035C28">28</xref></sup> Considering that the iPS cells are derived from MEFs, changing the locations of cells from positions with low developmental potency (MEFs) to those with high developmental potency (iPSs) strongly supports our notion that PCA analysis can visualize and predict the developmental potency of cells.</p><fig id="DSN035F3" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Global gene expression profiles of 44 different cell types.

The PCA figures (Figs&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN035F3">3</xref>B) show remarkable similarity to the conceptual picture of Waddington's epigenetic landscape, where cell lineage trajectories represent creodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN035C1">1</xref></sup> Such a concept has been taken for granted by embryologists for over a century, but it now seems to be substantiated by the global gene expression patterns. The locations of cells in the multidimensional transcript profile space can be used to identify cells of unknown origin, determine the differentiation status of cells and to assess the developmental potency of cells, possibly without going through experimental manipulation and testing of the cells. The present work also provides a framework for the future study of ES cell differentiation by visualizing the direction to which cells are going to differentiate.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dsn035/DC1">Supplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was entirely supported by the Intramural Research Program of <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor>, <grant-sponsor>National Institute on Aging</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>Z01 AG000662</grant-num>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="dsn035_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="dsn035_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="dsn035_dsn035_Table1.xls"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="dsn035_dsn035_Table2.xls"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel" xlink:href="dsn035_dsn035_Table3.xls"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" xlink:href="dsn035_dsn035_Video1.avi"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo" xlink:href="dsn035_dsn035_Video2.avi"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.
