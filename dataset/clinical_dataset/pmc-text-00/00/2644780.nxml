This method is reproducible, as two independent sets of animal infection studies identified the same set of 47 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> genes as expressed <italic>in vivo</italic>, and a majority of them displayed higher expression levels in mice, than <italic>in vitro</italic>. The variable expression of these genes in multiple tissue locations possibly reflects the adaptive responses of the pathogen to local host environments, enabling immune evasion, adhesion, or nutrient uptake, among other possibilities. Furthermore, regardless of their functional role in pathogen persistence, antigens that are highly produced in certain host sites, such as the joints and heart, could participate in the genesis of inflammatory disease. Our qRT-PCR analysis also identified a set of 44 <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> genes that may not be important for mammalian infectivity, as none of these displayed detectable transcription within the first 4 weeks of infection.

Lmp1 was first described in an earlier study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Antonara1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> which highlighted the protein as a potential <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> adhesin and indicated that Lmp1-specific antibodies develop in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>&#x02013;infected mammals. <italic>lmp1</italic> does not belong to the paralogous gene families in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Casjens1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> and is thought to encode a relatively large 128-kDa outer membrane protein with putative type I signal peptide. It is not clear if the leader peptide is indeed cleaved or if the hydrophobic N-terminus serves as a membrane anchor; however, the antigen is exposed on the spirochete surface. Lmp1 retains 86&#x02013;88&#x00025; amino acid identity across orthologs in the related infectious spirochetes <italic>B. afzelii</italic> and <italic>B. garinii</italic>, with the highest sequence conservation in the amino and carboxyl termini. Analysis of the <italic>lmp1</italic> locus indicates that the gene overlaps with the immediate upstream gene, <italic>bb0209</italic>, and shares a short intergenic region with the downstream gene, <italic>bb0211</italic>, suggesting these three genes are likely part of an operon; however, the <italic>lmp1</italic> mutant is able to express both <italic>bb0209</italic> and <italic>bb0211</italic>. Notably, <italic>bb0211</italic> encodes for the DNA mismatch repair protein, MutL, and therefore likely bears a house-keeping function in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> biology. Although the functions of <italic>bb0209</italic> and <italic>lmp1</italic> are unknown, the amino terminus of BB0209 and the carboxyl terminus of Lmp1 both contain multiple tetratricopeptide repeat domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Sikorski1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, which are shown to mediate protein-protein interaction and the assembly of the pilus and multiprotein complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Das1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the central region of Lmp1 harbors a unique cluster of seven repeat motifs, each consisting of 54 amino acids, which is highly conserved amongst Lmp1 orthologs and potentially participates in adherence to host components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Antonara1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Our studies further establish that Lmp1 is a surface-exposed virulence factor of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, as <italic>lmp1</italic> deletion severely interferes with spirochete infectivity and pathogenesis. After its inoculation in the host, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> remains locally in the dermis for a few days and then disseminates to distant organs, likely via the bloodstream, during the first week of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Hodzic1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Hodzic2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data indicate that Lmp1 function may not be important during early infection, including spirochete dissemination, since no apparent differences in the burdens of wild type spirochetes and <italic>lmp1</italic> mutants were observed in murine blood samples collected at day 3, 5 (data not shown) and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000326-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Instead, <italic>lmp1</italic> mutants displayed a severe reduction in numbers in the disseminated organs by day 10, implying that Lmp1 is critical for the persistence of the spirochete in murine tissues. In agreement with the higher level of expression of <italic>lmp1</italic> in the cardiac tissue, as compared to other organs, a greater effect of <italic>lmp1</italic> deletion was also observed in the heart where the mutants were selectively eliminated after 10 days of infection, suggesting that Lmp1 plays a dominant role in spirochete infection of the heart. <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> burdens in mice began to decline after first two weeks of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Hodzic1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, which coincides with the development of the acquired immune response, such as neutralizing antibodies that controls spirochete infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Connolly1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Steere2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. This is consistent with the observation that <italic>lmp1</italic> mutants persist in similar levels to the parental isolate in the heart at day 7, despite dramatic wild type expression of <italic>lmp1</italic>, but begin to decline during the second week. The ability of <italic>lmp1</italic> mutants to survive in SCID mice further indicates that the function of the Lmp1 is not related to metabolic requirements of the spirochete survival <italic>in vivo</italic>, as shown for <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> PncA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Purser1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> or AdeC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Jewett1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, but rather is associated with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> survival in host immune environments. <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> isolates missing the lp28-1 plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-LabandeiraRey1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, which houses VlsE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Lawrenz1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Zhang1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, display similar impaired host persistence in immunocompetent mice, as VlsE likely confers protection against host-generated borreliacidal antibodies. Therefore, while <italic>lmp1</italic> is variably expressed in diverse tissue environments and carries a predominant role in spirochete persistence in the heart, a basal level of <italic>lmp1</italic> expression is noted throughout the murine infection which, based on our <italic>in vitro</italic> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000326-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), might contribute to the protection of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> against host-acquired immune responses, as was recently proposed for <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> OspA in feeding ticks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000326-Battisti1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, we have identified a select set of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> genes encoding potential membrane proteins that are expressed during murine infection. Many of these <italic>in vivo</italic>-expressed genes are differentially expressed in various host tissues, including joints and heart, and can participate in pathogen persistence and the genesis of disease. Here, we present direct evidence that one microbial gene expressed at higher level in the cardiac tissue, <italic>lmp1</italic>, encodes an essential virulence factor that plays an important role in immune evasion and dramatically influences spirochete persistence in murine tissues and the genesis of inflammation. Whereas previously identified <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> virulence antigens are mostly plasmid-borne, and thus have greater instability and sequence divergence, Lmp1 is chromosomally encoded and is relatively conserved among orthologs in related infectious spirochetes.
