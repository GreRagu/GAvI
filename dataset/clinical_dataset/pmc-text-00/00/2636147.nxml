In all cases, silicone oil vacuoles, both freeand incorporated within macrophages were seen in all the retinallayers. Silicone oil vacuoles were seen in the optic nerve, choroid,retinal pigment epithelium, corneal stroma, iris and ciliary bodystroma, preretinal and subretinal membranes and retro-cornealmembranes. Silicone oil migration could be seen in intraoculartissues as early as two months post surgery. There was no definitehistopathological correlation between duration of tamponadeand distribution of silicone oil vacuoles. Silicone oil vacuoleswere seen in the optic nerve in eyes with neovascular glaucoma.Chronic inflammatory reaction was observed in the retinal tissuein the vicinity of silicone oil vacuoles.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Intraocular tamponade</kwd><kwd>penetrating trauma</kwd><kwd>proliferative diabetic retinopathy</kwd><kwd>proliferative vitreoretinopathy</kwd><kwd>retinal detachment</kwd><kwd>silicone oil</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Silicone oil tamponade forms an important aspect ofvitreoretinal procedures, especially in cases of complicatedretinal detachments.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Intraocular silicone oil is associated witha number of complications (keratopathy, glaucoma, cataract,subretinal migration of silicone oil, reproliferation of epiretinaland subretinal fibrous membranes) if left <italic>in situ</italic> for an extendedperiod of time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> The indications, type of silicone oilused and the technique of injection has undergone major variations in thelast four decades.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> The histopathological evaluation of siliconeretinopathy in monkeys using electron microscopy dates backto 1975.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> We report a histopathological study of eight enucleatedsilicone oil-filled eyes done in our ocular pathology laboratoryduring a period of six years (from 2000 to 2005) to demonstratethe patterns of intraocular migration of silicone oil.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Histopathological study</title><p>Fixation of eyeball specimen was done in 10% formaldehyde for12 to 24 h.

The globe was opened in such a wayto include the pupil and optic nerve in the same section. Thesection of the globe was then examined and photographedfrom anterior to posterior starting from the cornea till thesclera and optic nerve and then the histopathological slidestained with hematoxylin and eosin was prepared [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>]. The histopathological study was carried out under lightmicroscopy.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Eight eyes of eight patients were included in the study afterenucleation and histopathological analysis was carried outas a retrospective chart review. The clinical data and thehistopathological reports were recorded and analyzed. Themean age of the patients was 27.5 years (range, 10 to 42 years).Seven of eight patients were males (87.5%). The primaryindications for silicone oil injection was penetrating injury infive eyes, blunt injury in two eyes, and proliferative diabeticretinopathy in one eye. The mean duration of silicone oiltamponade was 81.14 months (range, 2 to 120 months). In allcases 1000 centi-stokes silicone oil was used. At the time ofenucleation, four patients had low intraocular pressure and twopatients had neovascular glaucoma. All patients had multipleintraocular surgeries (at least three) prior to enucleation. Theeyes which underwent primary repair for ocular trauma foran open globe injury had the longest duration of siliconeoil tamponade (74, 120, 120 months respectively). None ofthese eyes showed raised intraocular pressure or neovascularglaucoma, and the silicone oil vacuoles were seen only inthe retinal tissue on histopathology. The longer durationof silicone oil tamponade did not influence the intraocularmigration of oil vacuoles into various tissues. The mostextensive distribution of silicone oil was observed in threeeyes. The first eye had a history of penetrating injury, withthe duration of silicone oil in the eye being 74 months, withrecurrent retinal detachment postoperatively, and the siliconeoil vacuoles were found in the conjunctiva, cornea, retro-corneal membrane, ciliary body, iris, retina and subretinalmembranes. The second eye was also post traumatic, withthe duration of silicone oil tamponade of 84 months, andthe oil vacuoles were found in angle structures, iris, ciliarybody, and the retina (most notably the inner retinal layers). Inboth these cases, there was extensive bare choroid. The thirdeye had proliferative diabetic retinopathy, with the durationof tamponade being only two months, and the silicone oilvacuoles being present in the conjunctiva, anterior chamber,iris, ciliary body, angle, retina and the optic nerve [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].The eyes which developed neovascular glaucoma (two ofeight eyes) before enucleation (one with proliferative diabeticretinopathy, and other with penetrating trauma) showed thepresence of silicone oil vacuoles in the optic nerve tissue.The histopathology of the enucleated eyes also showed thepresence of chronic inflammatory cellular infiltration in allthe ocular tissues, most notably in close proximity to thesilicone oil vacuoles.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>An earlier study by Knorr <italic>et al</italic>., had showed the presenceof silicone oil vacuoles in the retina as early as four weeksafter oil injection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> They had also shown the presence ofsilicone oil vacuoles in the optic nerve along with theretina in the eyes with raised intraocular pressure. In thesame study, the authors had concluded that there was noclinicohistopathological correlation between the presence ofvacuoles in the retina or optic nerve and the duration andviscosity of intraocular silicone oil. Our results corroboratewith the results previously described, and we also showed thepresence of silicone oil in various tissues in all the eyes, earliestbeing two months after silicone oil injection. We found thatthere is no association of intraocular migration of silicone oilwith the age, the etiology for intraocular tamponade, durationof silicone oil inside the eye, or postoperative course. Thepresence of oil vacuoles in the optic nerve is correlated withraised intraocular pressure and we are of the opinion that theeyes with raised intraocular pressure are more prone to opticnerve damage due to silicone oil and should be consideredfor an earlier oil removal surgery.</p><p>Wickham <italic>et al</italic>., have recently shown that the focal areasof intraretinal silicone oil were associated with disorganizedretinal architecture, retinectomy sites or subretinal oil, andthat the distribution of macrophages was closely related tothe distribution of silicone oil.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Chronic inflammatory cellularinfiltration was observed in all the eyes examined by us,most notably in the vicinity of silicone oil vacuoles in theretinal tissue, where the silicone oil vacuoles were shown tobe consistently present. The other ocular tissues also showedthe chronic inflammatory cellular infiltration associated withsilicone oil migration in that tissue.</p><p>Authors also found more extensive intraocular distributionof silicone oil either in case of proliferative diabeticretinopathy, or in eyes with large areas of bare choroid. Thesame observation was made by Basin <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> The authorshypothesize that the complicated and more extensivesurgeries in these eyes, along with the exposure of a large areaof choroid with silicone oil, increase chance of siliconeoil to enter the choroidal vessels.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref
