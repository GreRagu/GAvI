Seventy-five eyes of 75 patients with endothelial dysfunctions of different etiology, scheduled for DSEK, were includedin this study. Healthy donor cornea with a cell count of &#x0003e;2000 cells/sq mm was considered for transplantationin each case. Indications, operative problems and postoperative complications were noted. Best correctedvisual acuity (BCVA), refractive and keratometric astigmatism, central corneal thickness (CCT) and endothelialcell density (ECD) were analyzed for each patient after a minimum follow-up of three months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Main indication was pseudophakic corneal edema and bullous keratopathy in 53 (70.7%) eyes.Seventeen (22.7%) cases had moderate to severe Fuchs&#x02032; dystrophy with various grades of cataract; and DSEKwas combined with manual small-incision cataract surgery (MSICS) with posterior chamber intraocular lens(PCIOL) in those cases.

There were 46 males and 29 femaleswith a mean age of 54.2 &#x000b1; 11.3 years (range: 31 to 79 years). Allpatients had clinically significant stromal edema, microcysticepithelial edema or frank bullous keratopathy. Eighteen eyeswere phakic and 57 were pseudophakic. Fifty-eight (77.3%) ofthem had frank bullous keratopathy and 13 (17.3%) patientshad epithelial hypertrophy. Seventeen (22.7%) of the patientshad moderate to severe Fuchs&#x02032; dystrophy with different gradesof cataract, and were treated by combined DSEK and MSICSwith PCIOL. One young patient had posterior polymorphousdystrophy and was treated by DSEK alone. Preoperatively,in all cases, the BCVA in the affected eye was between handmovement (HM) to &#x02264;20/200 [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The preoperativerefractive errors data were obtained from spectacle historyin some cases, and the IOL power was calculated from thespectacle history or from the biometry of the same or other eye.The IOL power was selected to aim 0.5 D myopia as there is ahyperopic shift in &#x02032;DSEK triple procedure&#x02032; due to the increasedthickness of the postoperative cornea.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>The results in this series were highly encouraging indifferent types of endothelial dysfunctions - pseudophakicbullous keratopathy with PC IOL (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1A">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1B">1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1C">1C</xref>)as well as with anterior chamber intraocular lens (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2A">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2B">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2C">2C</xref> and in combinedcases in Fuchs&#x02032; dystrophy with cataract (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3A">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3B">3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3C">3C</xref>).After three months 62 (82.7%) patients regained 20/60 or bettervision with small spherical and cylindrical corrections. Thedetails of the results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. There were someco-morbid conditions in eight (10.7%) cases, detected after theoperation, like glaucomatous cupping in two cases, epiretinalmembrane in two cases and age-related macular degenerationin four patients.</p><p>There was no problem during donor button preparation inthe artificial AC except there was a little variation in the depthof dissection. Temporal approach was chosen in 14 (18.7%) casesbecause of scarring of the conjunctiva superiorly. The unfoldingof the donor lenticule was difficult in 18 (24.0%) cases, butthere was no occurrence of reverse unfolding (endothelial-sideup against the recipient&#x02032;s stroma). A 30-gauze reverse bentneedle was used in 11 (14.7%) cases for proper centration ofthe donor lenticule. In three cases (4.0%), additional sutures(one or two with 10-0 monofilament nylon) were required tosecure the tunnel.</p><p>The average spherical equivalent refractive error was0.85 &#x000b1; 0.95 D after three months. The mean refractiveastigmatism and the mean keratometric astigmatism were1.15 &#x000b1; 1.0 DCyl and 1.24 &#x000b1; 0.92 DCyl respectively. Thesechanges were not statistically significant. The average CCTand ECD were 670.8 &#x000b1; 0.32 &#x000b5;m and 1485.6 &#x000b1; 168.6/sq mm afterthree months. The mean endothelial cell loss after three monthswas 26.8 &#x000b1; 4.24% (range: 13.3-38.4%) which was statisticallysignificant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>There was no primary graft failure during the first threemonths. Pupillary block occurred in two cases on the firstpostoperative day and settled by full dilation of the pupil andhead positioning. Partial non-attachment of graft occurredin one case which was resolved after three weeks. Donordislocation occurred in six (8%) cases within 72 h of surgeryand all were reattached after rebubbling, which was done onthe same day on emergency basis. There was no graft rejectionor infection within the follow-up period of three months.However, one patient developed graft failure after three monthsdue to intractable secondary glaucoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Descemet stripping and endothelial keratoplasty representsthe most preferred type of posterior lamellar keratoplasty inrecent times. It allows selective replacement of diseased hostendothelium with a suitable and healthy donor posteriorlamella. The major advantage of posterior lamellar orendothelial keratoplasy procedure in comparison to PK is thatthe normal corneal surface of the recipient is retained becauseof the avoidance of surface corneal incisions and sutures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>This surgery may be manual (DSEK), automated (DSAEK)or Femto-second laser assisted (FS-DSEK) depending uponthe method of preparation of the posterior lamellar donorlenticule.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> Among these, manual dissection in DSEKis the least expensive and may be the more appropriate procedurein the Indian scenario.</p><p>The UCVA in most of the cases in this series is better thanconventional PK because of smooth ocular surface.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> TheBCVA is comparable in most situations, but unlike with PKas mentioned in other studies, patients undergoing DSEKdo not experience suture-induced astigmatism and surface-related problems.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> The regular refractive astigmatism iscomparable with results described in other studies. In thepresent series, the mean refractive astigmatism was 1.65 &#x000b1; 0.56D. This astigmatism was 1.15 &#x000b1; 1.35 D and 1.56 &#x000b1; 0.46 D in otherstudies after three to six months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Like in otherstudies, all DSEK patients in this series received their final postoperativespectacle correction by three months. In contrast, PK patientstypically undergo suture removal after one year and thenreceive final spectacle correction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p><p>Fortunately, there was no significant operative problem inthis series. Only in cases of bullous keratopathy with ACIOL,the introduction of &#x02032;taco&#x02032; and subsequently unfolding of donorlenticule were little difficult compared to PCIOL cases. Thefollowing precautionary measures were taken in those cases.Before insertion of &#x02032;taco&#x02032;, the AC must be well formed with BSS.The &#x02032;taco&#x02032; should not touch the IOL during insertion. Duringunfolding of the donor lenticule, BSS jet was used gently ratherthan by strong jet for gradual unfolding. Air was also used ina controlled manner to float the lenticule against host corneafor giving tamponade. Care was taken that injected air shouldnot go posteriorly into the vitreous cavity.</p><p>Postoperatively, donor dislocation occurred in six cases(8.0%) within 72 h after surgery and all of them weresuccessfully reattached by rebubbling immediately ondiagnosis. This dislocation rate is the same or lower thanother studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> One patient developed donor failureafter three months due to uncontrollable steroid-induced secondaryglaucoma. Other minor postoperative complications weresimilarly comparable with other reports and settled easily.The mean endothelial cell count after three months was1485.6 &#x000b1; 168.5 cell/sq mm and the endothelial cell loss wasbetween 26.8 &#x000b1; 4.24% (range: 13.3 to 38.4%) which is againcomparable with other series.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></p><p>Interestingly, in the Western world, donor selection criteriaare stricter than that in India: there the donor cell count mustbe &#x02265;2500 cells/sq mm preoperatively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> In India, as we do notget enough tissues with this kind of higher cell count, we keptour preoperative donor cell count criteria &#x0003e;2000 cells/sq mm. Inthis series, the donor used had an endothelial cell count rangebetween 2086 to 2740 cells/sq mm (mean 2284.7 cells/sq mm).</p><p>Recently, 53 patients of this series have completed their sixmonths&#x02032; follow-up. Now the cell loss is approximately 32.1%as compared to 26.8% after three months. This was againcomparable to PK and also with Terry&#x02032;s study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> The patients are now comfortable and happy, and some patients with PKdone earlier in the other eye are more happy and comfortablewith their DSEK-operated eye.</p><p>Still, there are some questions to be addressed with thiskind of surgery on a long-term basis, like interface problems,graft rejection rate (theoretically it should be less than PK, 7.5%in DSEK versus 13% in PK<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>), long-term endothelial cell lossin comparison to conventional PK, correct method to checkintraocular pressure (as the corneal thickness is increased),effect of increased corneal thickness in relation to the angle ofthe AC, and cataract surgical method in phakic eyes in future.The techniques for DSEK are still evolving and will continue tooffer new and exciting options for surgeons and patients andwill address these questions in future.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>In conclusion, DSEK provides rapid visual recovery withminimum astigmatism for the patients with enthdothelialdysfunctions. It can be safely combined with MSICS withPCIOL in patients with moderate to severe Fuchs&#x02032; dystrophywith cataract.
