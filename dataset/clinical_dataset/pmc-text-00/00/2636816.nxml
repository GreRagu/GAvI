In cattle, <italic>FXI </italic>deficiency has been described in Holstein cattle in Ohio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and later in Canadian cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], while some cases of hemorrhagic problems in British cattle have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. <italic>FXI </italic>deficiency may result in prolonged bleeding and anemia. Continued bleeding from the umbilical cord is sometimes seen in affected calves. Prolonged oozing of blood following dehorning or castration may also be observed.</p><p>Affected cows frequently have pink-colored colostrum. Blood in the milk led to the identification of the condition in a British dairy herd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Additionally, <italic>FXI </italic>deficiency causes to reduced reproductive performance and affected animals appear to be more susceptible to diseases such as pneumonia, mastitis and metritis. Therefore, the presence of this genetic defect may have a significant economic impact on the dairy industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Affected animals can survive for years with no overt clinical signs, even though they appear to have a higher mortality and morbidity rate.</p><p>Pedigree analysis indicates that <italic>FXI </italic>deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder like <italic>BLAD </italic>(Bovine Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency), <italic>DUMPS </italic>(Deficiency of Uridine Monophosphate Synthase), and <italic>CVM </italic>(Complex Vertebral Malformation). Accordingly, carriers (heterozygous) of the defective gene are outwardly normal, while affected animals (homozygous) have a mild hemophilia-like disorder; 25 percent of the offspring of a carrier bull and a carrier cow will be affected with a <italic>FXI </italic>deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Carrier cattle exhibit varying symptoms and degrees of reduced <italic>FXI </italic>activity. Current testing methods measure the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to monitor <italic>FXI </italic>activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although affected animals with <italic>FXI </italic>deficiency are relatively easy to classify, carriers of the disorder are often difficult to distinguish from normal individuals because of the overlap of activity ranges. To effectively control the spread of recessive defects such as <italic>BLAD</italic>, <italic>DUMPS</italic>, <italic>CVM</italic>, and <italic>FXI </italic>deficiency it is important to accurately identify animals that may appear clinically normal, but carry the mutant allele.</p><p>Marron et al. (2004) have identified the causative mutation for <italic>FXI </italic>deficiency. The authors found that the mutation consists of a 76 bp segment (AT(A)<sub>28</sub>TAAAG(A)<sub>26</sub>GGAAATAATAATTCA) insertion into exon 12 of <italic>FXI </italic>on chromosome 27. The insertion consists of long strings of adenine (A) bases and contains a stop codon that prevents the full-length protein from being made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study was to identify and calculate the frequency of the mutant <italic>FXI </italic>allele in Holstein cattle reared in Turkey.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Samples and DNA extraction</title><p>Two hundred twenty-five Holstein cows were sampled.

Upon examination of the mutation in bovine <italic>FXI</italic>, it is most likely that the protein is not absent, but merely truncated prematurely because of the presence of a stop codon that was introduced by the insertion. Because of the truncation, the mature protein would be lacking the entire serine protease domain encoded by exons 13&#x02013;15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p><italic>FXI </italic>deficiency in cattle has been reported in many different countries, such as the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], Britain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and the Czech Republic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, no case of <italic>FXI </italic>deficiency was previously reported in Holstein cattle reared in Turkey. As a first attempt, this study found that the mutant <italic>FXI </italic>allele frequency in Holstein cows in Turkey is 0.9% and the prevalence of carrier cattle is 1.8%. The prevalence ratio found in this study is similar to those reports in Canadian Holstein cattle (1.2%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], Japanese Holstein cattle (2.5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], Indian Holstein cattle (0.2%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and Czech Holstein and Simmental cattle (0.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The mutation that causes <italic>FXI </italic>deficiency introduces a premature stop codon. The <italic>FXI </italic>gene mutation in Holstein cattle reared in Turkey was confirmed by this study. Our results indicate that normal cattle have only one DNA fragment of 244 bp while heterozygous cattle exhibit two DNA fragments of 320 bp and 244 bp for the <italic>FXI </italic>gene deficiency.</p><p><italic>FXI </italic>deficiency has been shown to adversely affect the reproductive performance of cattle; the follicular diameter of the affected cattle is small and is accompanied by lower peak estradiol concentrations in plasma near the time of ovulation. The oestrous cycle of the affected cows is characterized by reduced follicular development and a slow process of luteolysis. Reproductive performance in cattle can be affected by metritis or mastitis, since neutrophil function appears to differ in cells that were isolated from normal cattle and those that came from <italic>FXI </italic>deficient cattle. Additionally, it has been suggested that both homozygous and heterozygous cattle might exhibit lower calving and survival rates. Therefore, the presence of this genetic defect may have a significant economic impact on the dairy industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The DNA-based test (PCR) described can detect the mutation responsible for <italic>FXI </italic>deficiency in Holstein cattle in Turkey. This is the 1st report on the FXI deficiency in Holstein cattle in Turkey. The bulls used for artificial insemination should be screened to determine whether they are FXI deficiency carriers or not. This is useful to decrease the frequency of the mutant allele in Turkish Holstein population, and selection program should be prepared to screen animals in order to eliminate the disorder.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HM participated in the design of the study, collected the blood samples, carried out the extraction of genomic DNA, PCR and DNA sequencing, performed the statistical analysis and participated in the writing of the manuscript.
