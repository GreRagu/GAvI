Until 2004, we used &#x0003c;1700 gand &#x0003c;32 weeks as screening cutoffs at our center and this missed14.5% of babies with severe ROP. Since 2004, by extending thegestational age cutoff to 34 weeks, a retrospective analysis hasshown that only 3.2% of threshold or worse ROP would bemissed in the same population.</p><p>Our study aimed to highlight the risk factors associated withsevere ROP, that could help the clinician strategize the screeningof babies in this birth weight cohort, to create a &#x02032;sickness criteria&#x02032;as suggested by Gilbert.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> The three risk factors significant onmultivariate analysis (outborn, respiratory distress syndromeand exchange transfusion) were identified as risk factors fordeveloping threshold or worse ROP in heavier babies.</p><p>As mentioned &#x02032;outborn&#x02032; babies were found to be at highestrisk for developing severe ROP (<italic>P</italic>  &#x0003c; 0.001). Of the 30 outbornbabies, 23 (76.6%) had threshold or worse ROP. The mean birthweight was 1610 g. The 23 eyes with Stage 5, were seen in these&#x02032;outborn&#x02032; babies. After discussion with the referring pediatrician(of outborn babies), we found that none of the &#x02032;outborns&#x02032; weresubjected to formal ROP screening, suggesting &#x02032;no examination&#x02032;or lack of facility for timely screening. This practice delayedthe diagnosis of severe ROP. Besides, 83% of these infants hadreceived oxygen without any monitoring. This is a commonpractice followed in many developing countries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></p><p>Whereas the manuscript establishes ROP characteristics inheavy babies of our country, this calls for a more efficient strategy,which includes increasing awareness among ophthalmologistsand neonatologists regarding severe ROP developing in heavierbabies in our setting. We need a closer and urgent look at therisk factors and the screening cutoffs followed in India to reducethe blindness burden in these &#x02032;heavy&#x02032; infants.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Wani</surname><given-names>VB</given-names></name><name><surname>Al Sabti</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Retinopathy of prematurity in Asian Indian babies weighing greater than 1250 grams at birth</article-title><source>Indian J Ophthalmol</source><year>2008</year><volume>56</volume><fpage>166</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18292637</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vinekar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Dogra</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Sangtam</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Narang</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Retinopathy of prematurity in Asian Indian babies weighing greater than 1250 grams at birth: Ten year data from atertiary care center in a developing country</article-title><source>Indian J Ophthalmol</source><year>2007</year><volume>55</volume><fpage>331</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17699940</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gilbert</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Retinopathy of prematurity - &#x02032;the second lull&#x02032;?</article-title><source>Br J Ophthalmol</source><year>2001</year><volume>85</volume><fpage>1017</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11520743</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Increased incidence and severity of retinopathy of prematurity in developing nations</article-title><source>J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus</source><year>2003</year><volume>40</volume><fpage>193</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12908528</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
