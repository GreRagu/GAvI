As a result methods are nowadays available for EU-authorised genetically modified organisms (GMOs), but only to a limited extent for EU-non-authorised GMOs (NAGs). In the last decade the diversity of genetically modified (GM) ingredients in food and feed has increased significantly. As a result of this increase GMO laboratories currently need to apply many different methods to establish to potential presence of NAGs in raw materials and complex derived products.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this paper we present an innovative method for detecting (approved) GMOs as well as the potential presence of NAGs in complex DNA samples containing different crop species. An optimised protocol has been developed for padlock probe ligation in combination with microarray detection (PPLMD) that can easily be scaled up. Linear padlock probes targeted against GMO-events, -elements and -species have been developed that can hybridise to their genomic target DNA and are visualised using microarray hybridisation.</p><p>In a tenplex PPLMD experiment, different genomic targets in Roundup-Ready soya, MON1445 cotton and Bt176 maize were detected down to at least 1%. In single experiments, the targets were detected down to 0.1%, i.e. comparable to standard qPCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Compared to currently available methods this is a significant step forward towards multiplex detection in complex raw materials and derived products. It is shown that the PPLMD approach is suitable for large-scale detection of GMOs in real-life samples and provides the possibility to detect and/or identify NAGs that would otherwise remain undetected.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In recent years there have been a number of incidents in which not (yet) EU-approved GMO varieties were present in shipments imported into the EU. Examples are Bt10 maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], LL601 rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and Bt63 rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As a result the EU has formulated additional regulations in the case of the Bt10 maize and Bt63 and LL601 rice varieties that stipulate that in specific shipments it needs to be certified that the named unapproved varieties are not present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. With the increasing complexity of world trade networks, asynchronous approval of GMO varieties in different parts of the world leads to the increased possibility that non-authorised GMOs (NAGs) are present in EU import batches.</p><p>Producers of new GM crop varieties to be marketed within the EU need to supply an event-specific method for the new variety as well as the related positive and negative reference materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As a result methods are nowadays available for EU-authorised genetically modified organisms (GMOs). On the other hand, methods for NAGs are only available to a very limited extent. In order to maintain current EU GMO regulations it is necessary to check for the presence of NAGs on the basis of available methods for GMO-events, -elements (or -constructs i.e. bridging elements) and -species according to the scheme as presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, leading to an increasing number of analyses per sample and shipment. This scheme uses available information on approved GMO crop varieties as a basis for the detection of the presence of authorised GMOs, NAGs and possibly even unknown GMO varieties. Therefore, multiplex methods need to be developed to cover diversification of GMOs, both authorized and NAGs.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Padlock probe locations in a GMO and GMO decision tree</bold>.

This is one of the main aims of the EU integrated project Co-Extra: the development of a multiplex method for GMO analysis that can screen an individual sample for the presence of a large number of GMO varieties and GMO elements in a single analysis. Different multiplex approaches have already been described in the scientific literature for GMO detection and identification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Initially multiplex PCR was the method of choice. Sensitive detection of eight maize GMO events is described by Heide <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] with qualitative multiplex PCR and fluorescence capillary electrophoresis (CE) detection with a detection limit of 0.1%. The method was optimised for samples containing 100% maize of which 0.4&#x02013;0.6% was of GMO origin. An undefined negative sample was included. The application of differential quantitative PCR (dQ-PCR: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]) was a step in detecting NAGs by means of a statistical model. Here, an event-specific PCR is compared quantitatively with a PCR for P35S and presence of NAGs is inferred when the number of molecules differs significantly from the expected number in the known event. Demeke and Ratnayaka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] developed a multiplex PCR assay for the detection of GM-canola OXY235 and T45 in canola samples with a detection limit of 0.1%. The assay was also shown to be valid when traces were present in a wheat or barley background.</p><p>Others combined PCR analysis with microarray detection. By using regular PCR in combination with microarray detection, Xu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] were able to multiplex up to three primer pairs in one reaction with a single GMO as target. The false positives (i.e. CaMV T35S and <italic>nos </italic>promoter in RRS) and absence of negative controls do suggest that the method could be further optimised. Multiplex PCR amplification and detection by low-density microarray was performed by Zhou <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] to detect target elements in Roundup-Ready soya (5) and Ms1/Rf1 canola (6). Multiple genes were detected using Cy5-dUTP within one GMO and detection was shown down to 0.5% when optimised primer concentrations were used per GMO. No signal was observed in the negative control, but it should be noted that this control comprised 50% DMSO. In a collaborative trial, Leimanis <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] applied microarrays for the detection of preamplified multiplex PCR products of GMO samples (9 GMOs, 5 plant species and 3 elements) with biotinylated primers, reaching sensitivity down to 0.1%. Due to the low detection level, the authors state that false positive signals may occur and that complex samples may not be successfully analysed by the method. Nevertheless this is the first validated multiplex study for GMO detection using an array format.</p><p>In some cases microarray detection was used without initial amplification step. In Nesvold <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and Tengs <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] a microarray was applied containing 25-basepair probes from 235 different vector sequences to detect (unknown) GMOs using statistical probability calculations. Although the method is very efficient in detecting vector sequences, false positives may occur when no true positive sample is present.</p><p>Other approaches were tested as well. Multidetection of viral DNA was investigated by Bouchet <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] using electrochemical detection of cylinder-shaped conducting polypyrrole. Here, a biochip was used to detect synthetic viral DNA targets with detection limit of 100 pM. The labelless approach was performed with two targets and absence of DNA as negative sample, although genomic DNA of a 100% GMO resulted in a much lower signal compared to the synthetic target. An electrochemiluminescence-based simplex bio-barcode method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] used gold nanoparticles, barcoded DNA in combination with streptavidine-coated magnetic beads and an electrode for detection. Quantitative analysis using digested and purified gDNA allowed detection, but not yet on multiple targets or in complex genomic samples.</p><p>In recent years another promising approach has been tested by a number of research groups. This approach combines a ligation reaction, subsequent amplification and (microarray) detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Peano <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] analysed for the presence of two species (comprising 5 different GMOs) on the basis of 7 primer combinations. Their technique makes use of PCR amplification and a subsequently a linear ligation detection reaction, followed by detection of Cy3-signals on a universal array containing ZIP-codes. This method has a sensitivity of 50 molecules in maize and 100 molecules in soya. Pang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] investigated the use of rolling circle amplification for the detection of genetically modified food. Here a pre-amplification PCR step was performed prior to the ligation reaction, rolling circle amplification and subsequent PCR amplification. Detection of 5% MON810 maize was possible by gel electrophoresis, although the authors anticipated difficulties in the extension of the method. Ehlert <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] used ligation dependent probe amplification in combination with CE-detection. Synthetic targets (canola) and genomic DNA (Roundup-Ready soya (RRS) and MON810) could be detected at 5%, while RRS event and CaMV P35S could be detected in 0.1% RRS. A difficulty that has often been encountered with this approach is the presence of (too high) background values for negative samples.</p><p>These publications on the combination of ligation, amplification and microarray detection show the potential of this approach. Also in other areas this strategy has already shown its value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In the present study ten different padlock probes were tested in a multiplex setting according to an optimised padlock probe ligation &#x02013; microarray detection (PPLMD) strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In short, a linear padlock probe with 5' and 3' target sequences can hybridise to their genomic counterpart. Upon hybridisation, the juxtaposed ends are ligated to form a circular molecule. The circular molecules are amplified by PCR with a universal forward and reverse-Cy3 primer. Each probe contains a unique DNA sequence (ZIP-code). Large amounts of linear ssDNA with a Cy3-labelled cZIP code are generated, which is visualised after hybridisation on a microarray.</p><p>The padlock probes used in the present study included four plant species probes, two GMO event-specific probes, three GMO element-specific probes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and one control probe for an artificial template. The probes were tested in dilution series ranging from 0.1 to 5% in simplex experiments, and on a mixture of GMOs in different percentages. The optimized PPLMD procedure presented here has significantly reduced background values compared to similar approaches as documented in the scientific literature, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the approach up to the levels required for the maintenance of EU GMO regulations. Furthermore, this is the first series of experiments using real-life complex samples with total genomic DNA, demonstrating the practical applicability of the PPLMD strategy for the detection of GMOs and NAGs, and thus for the maintenance of (EU) GMO regulations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and mixtures</title><p>See Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> for overview of wild type and GMO plant material.

This allowed exhaustion of the forward primer, switching from logarithmic amplification into linear amplification with the Cy3-labelled reverse primer. The PCR amplification was performed with 40 cycles. The amplification of labelled molecules was improved by increasing number of LATE cycles from 40 to 80 cycles and by extending the forward primer to compensate for the lowered T<sub>m </sub>due to the lower concentration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><p>Prior to hybridisation on the microarray, the probe was denaturated to prevent double stranded labelled molecules that could reduce efficient hybridisation onto the microarray.</p><p>The combination of these adjustments to the protocol resulted in a better signal on the microarray, less background and an internal ligation control that functioned as a positioning spot as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of padlock probes</title><p>Padlocks were validated in two ways: 1) their capacity to circularise on their artificial target, 2) their performance on genomic DNA. In all cases, the padlock probes showed a significantly lower C<sub>t </sub>value in real-time qPCR for the artificial target than for the non target control, indicating a more specific hybridisation. Furthermore, melting curve analyses suggested that the signals found in the water samples were more probably due to primer-dimer like artefacts than specific (background) amplification (not shown). Next, the padlock probes were tested on genomic target DNA (100% GMO when available). These qPCRs resulted in comparable C<sub>t </sub>values compared to synthetic DNA.</p><p>For microarray analysis, each padlock probe was tested in simplex and multiplex to establish the sensitivity and to screen for possible cross-hybridisation with other ZIP-codes on the array.

The three additional padlocks were cotton-specific, canola-specific and FMV P35S. In one experiment where 25% of each GMO was present (100% RRS, Bt176 and MON1445, completed with canola) all ten padlocks were able to recognise their target and showed a positive signal on the microarray (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Tenplex reaction with complex genomic GMO DNA</bold>. 2.5% Bt176 maize and 2.5% RR soya in a tenplex with target DNA for seven padlock probes.

The input amount was plotted against the end signal and a trend line calculated. Ideally, both the slope and the correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) of the trend line would be 1. For these 5 tests (MON1445:CaMV P35S, Bt176:CaMV P35S, Bt176:<italic>bar</italic>, Bt176:event, RRS:CaMV P35S) the average slope and R<sup>2 </sup>were 1.0210 +/- 0.1363 and 0.9756 +/- 0.0347 respectively, underlining the quantitative potential of this approach (results not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The maintenance of (EU) GMO regulations in the light of increasingly complex worldwide logistic networks requires sensitive multimethods for the detection and identification of approved as well as unapproved GMO crop varieties, including unknown GMOs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><p>So far a number of different approaches to develop such methods have been documented in the scientific literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], but sensitivity in a genomic DNA environment, lack of specificity, and high background levels are often reported as aspects that hamper the practical applicability of the different approaches. One of the most promising strategies in this area is the combination of probe ligation, amplification and microarray detection. The major advantage of this approach is that only the selected genomic sequences (employed in the padlock probe) are amplified and subsequently detected. The PPLMD system as described here is further developed and optimized with the aim to detect GMOs and GMO elements in a multiplex setting. The PPLMD approach has been developed as a screening method, but the resulting data do suggest that quantification may also be feasible. This aspect will, however, need further testing.</p><p>Optimisation of the protocol was reached primarily by three adjustments in comparison with earlier published PPLMD-like protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]: the use of Vent<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>exo<sup>- </sup>DNA polymerase instead of HotStar Taq DNA polymerase, the use of a SpikeTarget and associated SpikeLock padlock probe, and by applying an improved LATE-PCR strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] for the amplification phase.</p><p>In earlier experiments, HotStar Taq DNA polymerase was used to amplify the circularised padlock molecules. Here, 5'-3' exonuclease activity will degrade the previously transcribed circular single-stranded padlock molecule, probably resulting in fewer targets for PCR amplification. By experimenting with Vent<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>exo<sup>- </sup>DNA polymerase lacking this 5'-3' exonuclease activity, a strand displacement strategy of a circular template should allow the linear amplification of the circular padlock molecule, in a rolling circle-like amplification that increases the amount of target prior to PCR amplification. Although the results only showed a tendency that positive signals were improved and background signals were decreased compared to HotStar Taq DNA polymerase, the lack of exonuclease activity made Vent<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>exo<sup>- </sup>DNA polymerase the preferred choice to amplify circular molecules.</p><p>The second improvement relates to the introduction of the SpikeLock padlock probe and SpikeTarget molecules in the ligation reaction. The use of the SpikeLock padlock probe in combination with the SpikeTarget allows a basal reaction that serves as a ligation control, as well as visualisation of the positioning spots on the array that flank the ZIP-spots. Furthermore, the amount of SpikeLock (containing the cZIP-P) and SpikeTarget is equal in all samples and was thus used as an internal standard. Ligated molecules were amplified using the Cy3-labelled reverse primer and Cy5-labelled cZIP-P was added in all reactions. The calculated ratio is a measure for performance of the ligation reaction and this was also used to normalise the ratios of Cy3/Cy5. Additionally, Cy3- and Cy5-labelled cZIPB3 were added to the hybridization mixture to allow comparison between the arrays.</p><p>Finally, the PCR reaction for amplification of the circularised padlocks was performed on the basis of the so-called Linear After The Exponential (LATE) principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The LATE principle requires unequal amounts of forward and reverse primer. The Cy3-labelled reverse primer is present in a 500 nM concentration, while the forward primer is present in a 50 nM concentration. The forward primer is extended with two nucleotides to compensate for loss in T<sub>m </sub>due to the lower concentration. After the forward primer is depleted in the exponential amplification step, a linear phase is commenced in which preferentially the Cy3-labelled primer is extended, thus increasing the signal compared to an asymmetrical PCR (as performed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] where only the primer concentrations differed. Furthermore, to facilitate the LATE principle, the number of amplification cycles was increased from 40 to 80.</p><p>Using this optimised PPLMD protocol, experiments were performed in simplex and in multiplex. To establish the minimal amount that can be discriminated from a background signal, a dilution range with three GMOs was tested in the PPLMD system. As described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, low detection limits were achieved for CaMV P35S (recognising the 35S promoter that is often used in GMOs) and other targets in different GMOs tested.</p><p>The difference in sensitivity for CaMV 35S promoter sequence in the different GMOs can be explained by the number of integrations of the construct and the different genome sizes and ploidy numbers. DNA (200 ng) contains a limited amount of copy numbers of a certain target. In mixtures, the amount of each target is proportionally lower. The sensitivity for CaMV P35S was 0.1 (Bt176), 0.1 (RRS) and 0.5% (MON1445). RRS comprises the complete integration of the RRS genetic construct as well as two partial integrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Bt176 contains at least a double integration of the <italic>bar </italic>plasmid with the CaMV P35S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. MON1445 contains a single copy of both the CaMV and FMV 35S promoter sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The calculated amount of CaMV target molecules in 200 ng 0.1% Bt176, RRS and MON1445 is 146, 176 and 62, respectively. These data suggest that more MON1445 is necessary to detect CaMV P35S compared to RRS and Bt176, which may explain the observed difference in sensitivity. Overall, these experiments show the sensitivity and applicability of the PPLMD approach in different percentages of a single GMO: most padlocks detect their target genomic sequence in the range of 0.1&#x02013;0.5% GMO.</p><p>When DNA of 5% Bt176 and RRS was combined to yield 2.5% GMO each, the results showed that both GMO event targets could be detected. In a more complex sample of 1.7% of each Bt176, RRS and MON1445, the GMO elements FMV P35S and <italic>bar </italic>could still be detected, while the GMO element CaMV P35S, often used as a screening element, was still detectable in the lowest GMO mixture tested (1%). The sensitivity of the RRS-event was 5% in a pure sample and 2.5% in a mixture. This may be explained by the fact that in the dilution series, no 2.5%-step was included: the sensitivity of 5% in a pure sample may therefore be an underestimation. Also, in a non-target DNA mixture, padlocks (except for the maize padlock) of which the genomic target was not present did not result in a visible and significant signal on the microarray. Currently, alternative padlock probes are being investigated for the maize <italic>hmg </italic>and <italic>adh </italic>genes. The positive control for canola (and the SpikeLock for that matter) gave the expected positive signal. In follow-up experiments, padlock concentrations can be adjusted in the PPLMD protocol to further optimise the sensitivity of the approach. In mixtures of GM crop species the sensitivity was lower compared to the simplex experiments. Species-specific signals were lower because the change of 100% species-specific target in a pure sample, to 33% in a more complex mixture. An explanation for the overall reduced sensitivity could be a matrix effect in which non-DNA factors of the combined DNA samples influence the padlock ligation reaction as part of the PPLMD, thereby reducing the signal that would have been reached when the samples were analysed separately. Nevertheless all selected elements could be detected down to at least 2.5% and in single cases down to 1%. Here further probe selection and optimisation and standardisation of the PPLMD reaction conditions may lead to further improvement of the sensitivity in these 'real life' samples.</p><p>The outcome of this study demonstrates the applicability of the PPLMD method for detection of known and approved GM crop events. In previous publications authors often make use of synthetic target molecules when analysing GMOs in simplex or mixtures. In this article it was demonstrated that the sensitivity levels in real-life samples are between 0.1 and 5% in single DNA samples and between 1 and 2.5% in more complex mixtures of plant DNA isolated from seed. The negative controls are non-target plant species in equimolar amounts that reflect a real-life situation, instead of non-target- water-controls. The PPLMD method has been optimised using Vent<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>exo<sup>- </sup>DNA polymerase in combination with a SpikeLock padlock probe to increase the positive signals and reduce the background levels. From the results it can be concluded that padlock probe detection using PCR in combination with microarray detection allows positive detection of GMOs and GMO elements in plant tissues. In this article, a proof of principle was demonstrated to show the feasibility, sensitivity and applicability of PPLMD-based detection. PPLMD can thus be used as a screening method: detected approved GMOs can subsequently be further quantified by EU-validated event-specific quantitative PCRs. The method also offers a good basis for the detection of non-authorised GMOs (NAGs), including unknown GMOs. This latter category may gain further importance with the current increase of new GMO crop varieties on the world market, the potential of modern breeding strategies to adjust the physiology of crops and the growing complexity of global logistic networks.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TWP, HGB, AMAH and MMV carried out the design and testing of padlock probes and the molecular analyses.
