It has been proposed that procyclins protect parasites against proteases and/or participate in tropism, directing them from the midgut to the salivary glands. There are four different procyclin genes, each subject to elaborate levels of regulation. To determine if procyclins are essential for survival and transmission of <italic>T. brucei</italic>, all four genes were deleted and parasite fitness was compared in vitro and in vivo. When co-cultured in vitro, the null mutant and wild type trypanosomes (tagged with cyan fluorescent protein) maintained a near-constant equilibrium. In contrast, when flies were infected with the same mixture, the null mutant was rapidly overgrown in the midgut, reflecting a reduction in fitness in vivo. Although the null mutant is patently defective in competition with procyclin-positive parasites, on its own it can complete the life cycle and generate infectious metacyclic forms. The procyclic form of <italic>T. brucei</italic> thus differs strikingly from the bloodstream form, which does not tolerate any perturbation of its variant surface glycoprotein coat, and from other parasites such as <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, which requires the circumsporozoite protein for successful transmission to a new host.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Two diseases that are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, human sleeping sickness and Nagana, a disease of domestic animals, are caused by African trypanosomes.

Successful transmission of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> first involves the establishment of an infection in the insect midgut. This is followed by a maturation phase in which the parasites migrate to the salivary glands and finally give rise to metacyclic forms that can be transmitted to a new mammalian host.</p><p>Unlike many other unicellular parasites, <italic>T. brucei</italic> remains extracellular throughout its life cycle and survives in the circulation of the mammalian host and the protease-rich environment of the fly midgut by expressing specific coats of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored surface glycoproteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Roditi1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Urwyler1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In the mammalian host, bloodstream forms of the parasite are covered by a coat consisting of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). The VSG coat acts as a physical barrier that prevents access to underlying molecules and destruction of the parasite, at the cost of provoking a humoral immune response against itself. The process of antigenic variation, involving the periodic recruitment and expression of a new VSG gene from a repertoire of several hundred genes, prevents lysis by antibodies directed against previous coats. An intact VSG coat appears to be essential for the parasite, both in vivo and in culture, since perturbation of GPI anchor synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Nagamune1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> or down-regulation of the VSG mRNA by RNA interference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Sheader1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> is lethal.</p><p>When a tsetse fly feeds on an infected host, bloodstream forms are exposed to a multitude of proteases in the insect's midgut. Certain proteases, such as trypsin, kill slender (proliferating) bloodstream forms, but promote the differentiation of stumpy (cell-cycle arrested) bloodstream forms to the next stage of the life cycle, the procyclic form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Sbicego1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Synchronous differentiation of the stumpy form to the procyclic form can be induced in culture, either by proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Sbicego1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> or, more commonly, by the addition of citrate or <italic>cis</italic>-aconitate to the medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Brun1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Ziegelbauer1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. As the trypanosome differentiates, a membrane-anchored metalloprotease (MSP B) cleaves VSG from the surface, making way for a new stage-specific coat of several million copies of procyclins within the space of a few hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Gruszynski1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Grandgenett1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The two classes of procyclins, EP and GPEET, are characterised by internal dipeptide and pentapeptide repeats, respectively. These repeats are resistant to cleavage by MSP-B and tsetse midgut proteases, although the procyclin N-termini are removed by the latter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-AcostaSerrano1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Liniger1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, for reasons that are unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Liniger2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Expression of different forms of procyclin is regulated temporally. A few hours after differentiation is induced, trypanosomes express all three EP isoforms (EP1, EP2, EP3) and GPEET <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Vassella1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This is followed by a surge of GPEET synthesis, making it the predominant component of the coat of early procyclic forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-AcostaSerrano1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Vassella1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In vivo, GPEET is repressed after a few days and replaced by N-glycosylated forms of EP, EP1 and EP3, in late procyclic forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-AcostaSerrano1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In culture, trypanosomes can be kept as early procyclic forms when glycerol is present in the medium and induced to differentiate to late procyclic forms when glycerol is removed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Vassella2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. EP procyclins are also expressed by the mesocyclic form in the anterior midgut and by trypomastigotes in the proventriculus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Sharma1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, but not by the epimastigote form that colonises the salivary glands or the metacyclic form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Urwyler2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

We previously obtained an EP/GPEET null mutant by deleting the genes from the bloodstream form and then triggering the knockout to differentiate in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Vassella3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. After shedding the VSG coat, the null mutant required almost two months before it was able to proliferate normally. Analysis of this mutant revealed that, in the absence of procyclin polypeptide precursors, free GPI anchors were on the surface, forming a glycocalyx. Since both the wild type parental strain and the mutant were very poorly infectious for tsetse, we were unable to draw any conclusions about the function of procyclins in vivo. Several mutants have been generated in procyclic forms and tested in tsetse, but none of these gives a definitive answer about the role of procyclins in the fly. One mutant (Nour 6C) that lacked all EP genes, but still retained a single GPEET gene, was almost an order of magnitude less efficient than the wild type at establishing heavy midgut infections in flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Ruepp1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. The phenotype was partially restored by reintroduction of either EP1 or EP2, suggesting that they play a protective role. Mutants defective in GPI anchor biosynthesis showed different phenotypes. Mutants lacking the GPI transamidase (encoded by <italic>GPI8</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Lillico1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, or GlcNAc-phosphatidylinositol de-N-acetylase (encoded by <italic>GPI12</italic>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Gther1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> no longer synthesised membrane-bound EP or GPEET and were also extremely inefficient at establishing midgut infections. This could be due to a lack of GPI-anchored proteins other than procyclins, however. In contrast, deletion of the gene encoding another GPI biosynthetic enzyme, <italic>GPI10</italic>, had little effect on the ability of procyclic forms to infect flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Nagamune1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to any functions they might have in the first phase of infection, another possibility is that procyclins are required in order for <italic>T. brucei</italic> to leave the midgut and migrate to the salivary glands. It has not been possible to test this hypothesis previously as none of the mutants described above could complete the life cycle in the fly (a common problem when procyclic forms are cultured for any length of time). In order to study the function of procyclins throughout the life cycle we deleted all procyclin genes from a fly-transmissible strain. A surprising outcome of these experiments was that trypanosomes without a procyclin coat are still transmissible by tsetse, albeit with a substantial reduction in the prevalence and intensity of salivary gland infections.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>GPEET is not required for the establishment of infection</title><p>The procyclin mutants described to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Liniger2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Vassella3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Ruepp1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Btikofer1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> were generated in laboratory-adapted stocks that had either been passaged in rodents or maintained in culture for an extended period of time. For unknown reasons, these trypanosomes lose their ability to complete the life cycle in the fly. We therefore decided to generate a new null mutant in a fly-transmissible clone, AnTat 1.1. The basic arrangement of procyclin genes is the same as in <italic>T. brucei</italic> 427 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Vassella3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Both stocks have procyclin loci on chromosomes 6 and 10. In Antat 1.1, the locus on chromosome 6 is homozygous for the gene pair GPEET and EP3-3, while the two EP genes on chromosome 10 are heterozygous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004493-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The first knockout of the procyclin locus on chromosome 6 was generated in bloodstream forms. Bloodstream forms of pleomorphic stocks are notoriously difficult to transfect and maintain in culture, however, so subsequent knockouts were generated in procyclic forms. To maintain their competence to complete the life cycle, trypanosome clones were transmitted through tsetse and mice after each round of transfection, and triggered to differentiate to procyclic forms in vitro. Deletion of the procyclin locus from the second copy of chromosome 6 gave rise to the mutant &#x00394;GPEET that lacked the GPEET gene and the adjacent EP3-3 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004493-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004493-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004493.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic depiction of the procyclin loci in AnTat 1.1 and lineage of the knockouts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Vassella1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</title><p>GPEET2 is a variant that has 5 rather than 6 copies of the pentapeptide repeat.

Non-teneral flies (flies that have taken a blood meal) are more refractory to infection.

Under the conditions used, wild type AnTat 1.1 produces salivary gland infections in a high proportion of infected flies (25&#x00025; in this experiment, with a transmission index (TI) of 42.8&#x00025;). In general, the glands were heavily infected and electron micrographs showed the flagella of epimastigote forms in tight association with the salivary gland epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004493-g007">Figure 7A, B</xref>) as has been documented previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Tetley1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. &#x00394;GPEET produced salivary gland infections in fewer flies (10.7&#x00025; infection, TI&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;20.5&#x00025;); the difference to the wild type was slightly significant statistically (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.021).

One possible interpretation of these results is that trypanosomes might require more, or different procyclins in order to penetrate the proventriculus and gain access to the salivary glands. We can conclude, however, that procyclins are not essential for full cyclical transmission by the tsetse fly.</p><p>It could be hypothesised that multiple resistance genes carried by the null mutant and the addback might contribute to the reduction in maturation rates and/or the intensity of salivary gland infections.

In contrast to &#x00394;procyclin, however, there was no significant difference in the prevalence and transmission index of this mutant compared to wild type AnTat 1.1, and the majority of salivary gland infections were of heavy or intermediate intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004493-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The sequential deletion of pairs of procyclin genes from a fly-transmissible strain of <italic>T. brucei</italic> resulted in the unexpected finding that the null mutant, &#x00394;procyclin, was still able to complete the entire life cycle in tsetse and mammals. &#x00394;procyclin was able to establish heavy infections in the fly midgut at approximately two-thirds of the prevalence of its wild type parent and was able to produce mature salivary gland infections and be transmitted by flies to mice. In addition, bloodstream forms of the mutant were capable of differentiating to the procyclic form without a detectable growth phenotype.</p><p>In this study we have formally proven for the first time that procyclins are not essential for the establishment of an infection in the ectoperitrophic space. The null mutant expresses free GPIs, however, and these may take over the function(s) of procyclins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Vassella3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Nagamune2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The observation that &#x00394;procyclin is notably more robust than other procyclin mutants that we have generated previously is most probably because of the experimental strategy that was used. It was necessary to do this because prolonged passage in rodents or in culture tends to select for parasites that lose the ability to differentiate and/or complete the life cycle. Deletion mutants were therefore subjected to fly transmission after each round of transfection, selecting for parasites that could adapt to a progressively thinner protein coat. This is in contrast to the EP/GPEET null mutant generated in bloodstream forms, which makes the transition from a full VSG coat to no glycoprotein coat when the parasite differentiates to the procyclic form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Vassella3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> or to the Nour 6C mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Ruepp1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, which first becomes negative for procyclins when GPEET is repressed a few days post infection in the fly midgut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Vassella2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The expression of GPEET mRNA is elaborately regulated by its 3&#x02032; UTR, both in the fly and in response to carbohydrate sources and mitochondrial activity in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Vassella2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Vassella4">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Nevertheless, trypanosomes lacking GPEET were able to establish midgut infections as efficiently as the wild type, in both teneral and non-teneral <italic>G. m. morsitans</italic>, even when a low infective dose was used. They were also equally competitive in mixed infections with the CFP-tagged wild type, which has the full complement of procyclins. The function of GPEET may only become apparent in other species of <italic>Glossina</italic> or under less favourable conditions for transmission. We have found that a mutant that constitutively expresses GPEET is transmitted very efficiently (unpublished data). The GPEET expressed by late procyclic forms and epimastigote forms was not phosphorylated, however, which is consistent with reports that the activity of the kinase is restricted to early procyclic forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Schlaeppi1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>On its own, the procyclin null mutant could colonise the midgut at rates and intensities comparable to the parental strain, and its reduced fitness only became apparent in mixed infections. This contrasts with a deletion mutant lacking all procyclin-associated genes, which could compete as effectively as the wild type in mixed infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Haenni1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. There are two possible interpretations of these results. Midgut infections are reported to plateau at a constant number of &#x0223c;2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Welburn1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-VanDenAbbeele1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The simplest explanation is that a fitter strain would replicate faster and occupy the available space before &#x00394;procyclin would be able to do so. This implies that a coat of free GPIs cannot completely substitute for procyclins and may leave other surface molecules vulnerable to attack by proteases. Another possibility is that trypanosomes expressing procyclins might elicit an anti-microbial response that affects parasites that are not covered by the same coat. What the nature of this response might be is unknown at present, but it does not seem to involve an increase in defensin or attacin transcripts (M. Oberle, unpublished data).</p><p>The null mutant was able to produce mature infections, demonstrating that procyclins are not required to direct the trypanosomes to the salivary glands. The prevalence of salivary gland infections and transmission index were about 10-fold lower than with the wild type, however, and the number of trypanosomes was also reduced by more than one order of magnitude. Since procyclins are not normally detected on the surface of epimastigote forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Urwyler2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, the lack of procyclins or the expression of free GPIs on the surface of midgut forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004493-Vassella3">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> might exert an indirect effect. Perturbation of the surface architecture of the parasite, for example by exposing surface molecules that are normally shrouded by procyclins, might alter interactions with host molecules. This, in turn, could conceivably reduce migration and/or adherence of epimastigote forms to the salivary gland epithelia. These hypotheses are extremely difficult to test, however, given the paucity of differentiation markers and the very low numbers of epimastigote forms in glands infected with &#x00394;procyclin. The finding that the maturation rate could not be restored by the reintroduction of a single procyclin gene into the null mutant might be due to a requirement for multiple procyclin isoforms, in order for the parasite to migrate efficiently, or for appropriately regulated expression. Another possibility is that trypanosomes that have abundant free GPIs on their surface may have difficulty readjusting to attaching GPI anchors to proteins such as BARP, which might be needed for successful colonisation of the salivary glands. In line with this, the sequential deletion of procyclin genes resulted in progressively worse maturation rates and transmission indices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004493-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, although procyclins are not essential, trypanosomes that express them are clearly at a competitive advantage and would probably eradicate procyclin-negative cells within one cycle of transmission. It is conceivable that a primordial trypanosome might originally have been covered by a glycocalyx of free GPIs and only later have acquired surface protein moieties that enhanced its survival and transmission.
