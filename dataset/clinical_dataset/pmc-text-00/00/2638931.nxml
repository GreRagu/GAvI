To avoid overfitting with this method, all available DNA-binding proteins from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are used to construct the models. The random forest (RF) algorithm is used because it is fast and has robust performance for different parameter values. A novel hybrid feature is presented which incorporates evolutionary information of the amino acid sequence, secondary structure (SS) information and orthogonal binary vector (OBV) information which reflects the characteristics of 20 kinds of amino acids for two physical&#x02013;chemical properties (dipoles and volumes of the side chains). The numbers of binding and non-binding residues in proteins are highly unbalanced, so a novel scheme is proposed to deal with the problem of imbalanced datasets by downsizing the majority class.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The results show that the RF model achieves 91.41% overall accuracy with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.70 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.913. To our knowledge, the RF method using the hybrid feature is currently the computationally optimal approach for predicting DNA-binding sites in proteins from amino acid sequences without using three-dimensional (3D) structural information. We have demonstrated that the prediction results are useful for understanding protein&#x02013;DNA interactions.</p><p><bold>Availability:</bold> DBindR web server implementation is freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbi.seu.edu.cn/DBindR/DBindR.htm">http://www.cbi.seu.edu.cn/DBindR/DBindR.htm</ext-link>.</p><p><bold>Contact:</bold> <email>xsun@seu.edu.cn</email></p><p><bold>Supplementary information:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btn583/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at <italic>Bioinformatics</italic> online.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title><p>Protein&#x02013;DNA interactions control a variety of vital biological processes, such as gene regulation, DNA replication and repair, recombination and other critical steps in cellular development (Luscombe <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2000</xref>). Mutations of DNA-binding residues, such as those on the tumor repressor protein P53, may be directly involved in human diseases (Bullock and Fersht, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2001</xref>). Thus, the ability to identify the amino acid residues that recognize DNA can significantly improve our understanding of these biological processes and affect the potential for guiding site-directed mutagenesis studies for the functional characterization of DNA-binding proteins, and can further contribute to advances in drug discovery, such as aiding the design of artificial transcription factors (Ho <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2007</xref>; Wang and Brown, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2006a</xref>).</p><p>The protein&#x02013;DNA recognition mechanism is complicated and the interactions consist of a variety of atomic contacts involving hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts and electrostatic, water-mediated bonds between amino acid residues and nucleotide bases. Such residues that recognize DNA can be identified from the three-dimensional (3D) structure of protein&#x02013;DNA complexes (Siggers and Honig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2007</xref>). Unfortunately, 3D structures of such complexes are available for &#x0003c;5% of all known DNA-binding proteins (Ofran <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2007</xref>). Moreover, it is a very expensive and time-consuming process to solve the structure of a protein&#x02013;DNA complex through experimental methods. A variety of computational methods have been developed to identify DNA-binding interface residues from 3D structures (Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2003</xref>; Tjong and Zhou, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2007</xref>; Tsuchiya <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2004</xref>). However, these methods have at least two major limitations: (i) One problem with using the structure of an unbound protein to predict sites involved in interactions with DNA is that the actual structure of the DNA-bound protein may differ substantially from the unbound form. (ii) The other problem is that structure-based computational methods still involve the expensive and time-consuming process of experimental determination of protein structure (Kuznetsov <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2006</xref>; Ofran <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2007</xref>).</p><p>An alternative to structure-based prediction is to predict DNA-binding residues directly from amino acid sequences. Machine learning techniques provide an effective approach for the construction of classifiers for this task, and predicting binding residues can be operated under the assumption that a given protein is bound to the DNA. Recently, neural network models have been constructed to identify protein&#x02013;DNA interface residues relying on sequence information and residue solvent accessibility (Ahmad <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2004</xref>). Evolutionary information in terms of position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) have contributed to a better prediction performance of DNA-binding sites (Ahmad and Sarai, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2005</xref>). Yan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2006</xref>) trained a naive Bayes classifier to predict DNA-binding sites based on the identities of sequence and entropy of the target residue. More importantly, a variety of support vector machine (SVM) classifiers have been developed for automated identification of DNA-binding residues with high accuracy (Bhardwaj and Lu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2007</xref>; Ho <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2007</xref>; Kuznetsov <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2006</xref>; Ofran <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2007</xref>; Wang and Brown, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">b</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we aim to design optimal predictors for DNA-binding sites in proteins directly from amino acid sequences. In designing classifiers, the following points are taken into consideration: (i) Approaches learning from a small training dataset can result in the over-fitting of training data and will then have poor generalization performance for new data. Accordingly, it is necessary that all available datasets of DNA-binding proteins are employed to build a new classifier for recognizing binding residues (Bhardwaj and Lu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2007</xref>; Ofran <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2007</xref>). (ii) The SVM is a powerful machine-learning algorithm developed from statistical learning theory (Vapnik, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">1998</xref>) that has been successfully applied in many fields for data classification. However, it is definitely time consuming to find the appropriate kernel function and optimal-free parameters of an SVM for very large training datasets. So it is significant to find a new algorithm that is fast and robust for different parameter values. (iii) Although many methods have been proposed, it is still challenging to predict DNA-binding residues directly from amino acid sequence data. To our knowledge, incorporating more effective features is the most important way of improving the performance of classifiers. (iv) The numbers of binding and non-binding residues in proteins are significantly unbalanced such that the problem of imbalanced datasets should be considered in enhancing the prediction accuracy. (v) The prediction reliability is an important factor that shows more information about the quality of the prediction. (vi) How do we ensure that parameter estimation and model generation are completely independent of the test data? (vii) What about the performance of distinguishing DNA-binding proteins from non-binding proteins?</p><p>In this article, we propose a novel method for predicting DNA-binding residues using the random forest (RF) algorithm in conjunction with a hybrid feature by combining evolutionary information of the amino acid sequence, orthogonal binary vector (OBV) information that reflects the characteristics of 20 kinds of amino acids for two physical&#x02013;chemical properties (dipoles and volumes of the side chains) and secondary structure (SS) information. The results show that the RF-based model achieves 91.41% overall accuracy with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.70, and with a sensitivity of 76.57% and a specificity of 94.38%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="SEC2"><title>2 MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2.1"><title>2.1 Dataset</title><p>DBP-374 is a dataset of 374 structures of representative protein&#x02013;DNA complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2000</xref>). We collected all protein&#x02013;DNA complexes (released by October 17, 2007) determined by X-ray crystallography with a resolution better than 3.5&#x000c5;. Redundancy among the amino acid sequences was removed by clustering analysis using the blastclust program in the BLAST package (Altschul <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">1990</xref>) from NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/download.shtml">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/download.shtml</ext-link>) with a threshold of 25% for sequence identity. Thus, the non-redundant DBP-374 dataset listed in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btn583/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> was created by retaining only the longest sequence in each cluster.</p><p>As in the previous studies (Ahmad and Sarai, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2005</xref>; Ahmad <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2004</xref>; Ho <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2007</xref>; Wang and Brown, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">b</xref>), an amino acid residue within a protein sequence is designated as a binding site if it contains at least one atom that falls within the cutoff distance of 3.5&#x000c5; from any atoms of the DNA molecule in the complex, and all other residues are labeled non-binding sites. The DBP-374 dataset contains 5652 DNA-binding residues and 74 782 non-binding residues.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2.2"><title>2.2 Features of data instances</title><p>RFs are constructed using residue-wise data instances from the protein sequences of the DBP-374 dataset. Each data instance is a segment of amino acid sequences with length &#x003b2; = 11, where &#x003b2; is the sliding window size. Compared with other window sizes, the RF classifiers constructed with &#x003b2; = 11 present the best performance. From an amino acid sequence with <italic>m</italic> residues, a total of (<italic>m</italic>&#x02212;&#x003b2;+1 &#x02212; &#x003b3;) data instances are extracted, where &#x003b3; is the number of residues that lack information about their atomic coordinates in the PDB entries. A data instance is labeled with &#x02018;P&#x02019; (positive) if the central residue is DNA-binding or &#x02018;N&#x02019; (negative) if the central residue is non-binding.</p><p>Electrostatic (including hydrogen bonding) and hydrophobic interactions probably dominate protein&#x02013;DNA interactions, and can be reflected by the dipoles and volumes of the side chains of amino acids, respectively. In the protein&#x02013;DNA complex structures, hydrogen bond is a major interaction force and its strength is associated with the dipoles involved hydrogen bond (Coulocheri <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2007</xref>). Based on the dipoles and volumes of the side chains, the 20 kinds of amino acids can be clustered into seven classes (Shen <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2007</xref>). The unique amino acid cysteine in the seventh class is called back to the third class in this study because disulfide bonds have no special attribution to protein&#x02013;DNA interaction. Therefore, the 20 kinds of amino acids are grouped into six classes, namely Class 1:Ala, Gly, Val; Class 2: Ile, Leu, Phe, Pro; Class 3: Tyr, Met, Thr, Ser, Cys; Class 4: His, Asn, Gln, Tpr; Class 5: Arg, Lys; and Class 6: Asp, Glu. Amino acids in each class are encoded as an OBV, for example (1,0,0&#x02026;) or (0,1,0&#x02026;) and the vector is 6D. In this article, each data instance is coded with a hybrid feature by combining the OBVs of the amino acids, evolutionary information of the amino acid sequence and SS information of the amino acids.</p><p>In this work, evolutionary information of amino acid sequences in terms of their PSSMs are generated for prediction of DNA-binding sites (Bhardwaj and Lu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2007</xref>; Ho <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2007</xref>; Kuznetsov <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2006</xref>; Ofran <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2007</xref>). The PSSM elements are scaled to fall within the range 0&#x02013;1 by the standard logistic function (Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2006</xref>):<disp-formula id="M1"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="btn583m1.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula>SS information extracted from the PDB files is encoded as follows: helix (1,0,0), strand (0,1,0) and others (0,0,1). For each data instance, the input vector contains 319 feature values, including 220 (20 &#x000d7; 11) PSSMs, 66 (6 &#x000d7; 11) OBVs and 33 (3 &#x000d7; 11) SS elements. The SS information was, however, predicted by the PREDATOR program (Frishman and Argos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1997</xref>) during the prediction of new proteins.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2.3"><title>2.3 Algorithms for classification</title><p>RF is a classification algorithm that uses an ensemble of tree-structured classifiers (Breiman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2001</xref>). The RF algorithm is implemented by the randomForest (version 4.5-18) R package (Liaw and Wiener, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2002</xref>).</p><p>To ensure that parameter estimation and model generation of RFs are completely independent of the test data, a nested cross-validation procedure (Scheffer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">1999</xref>) is performed. Nested cross-validation means that there is an outer cross-validation loop for model assessment and an inner loop for model selection. In this study, the original samples are randomly divided into <italic>k</italic> = 5 parts in the outer loop. Each of these parts is chosen one by one for assessment, and the remaining 4/5 of the samples are for model selection in the inner loop where a type of cross-validation using the so-called out-of-bag (OOB) samples is performed.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2.4"><title>2.4 The imbalanced data problem</title><p>The problem of imbalanced datasets occurs in many practical classification events where the goal is to detect a rare but important case. All solutions to this problem can roughly be grouped into two main categories (Cohen <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2006</xref>): the first consists of preprocessing the data to re-establish class balance (either by upsizing the minority class or downsizing the majority class); whereas the second involves modifying the learning algorithm itself to cope with imbalanced data. Kubat and Matwin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1997</xref>) presented an algorithm for the one-sided selection of examples by downsizing the majority class. Examples of the majority class can roughly be divided into four groups: class-label noise, borderline, redundant and safe examples, and the algorithm attempts to create a subset retaining the safe examples (Kubat and Matwin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1997</xref>). A similar approach is used in this article to deal with the imbalanced data problem (only 7.25% of the total data instances are positive).</p><p>The algorithm for downsizing the majority class can be summarized as follows.<list id="l1" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Let &#x003a9; be the original training set and &#x003d5; be the set of all negative data instances of &#x003a9;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Let &#x003c8; contain all positive data instances and 1% randomly selected negative data instances from &#x003d5;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Predict &#x003d5; using the model trained by the data instances in &#x003c8; based on the RF and then get <italic>F</italic><sub>+</sub>, where <italic>F</italic><sub>+</sub> is the fraction of the tree votes for the positive class in each data instance.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Repeat steps 2 and 3. 10 times.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Combine the <italic>F</italic><sub>+</sub> from all 10 iterations, and regard the data instances in &#x003d5; of which 50% of the <italic>F</italic><sub>+</sub> values are between 1/9 and 2/9 as safe (because the ratio of positive to negative instances in &#x003c8; is 5331:681).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Get the processed dataset &#x003b6; containing all positive data instances and the safe negative data instances from &#x003d5;.

Therefore, the SVM method was selected as an alternative algorithm with which to compare the RF classifier in this study. Both classifiers were applied to the same dataset DBP-374 with the same hybrid features and were assessed by nested cross-validation. For the SVM classifier, the model selection in the inner loop of the nested cross-validation procedure is performed by a standard grid parameter search. The ROC analysis shows that the SVM classifier (AUC 0.921) slightly outperforms the RF classifier (AUC 0.913) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>A). Thus, we conclude that the hybrid feature contributes most to the excellent prediction performance.

To ensure that model generation is completely independent of the test data, a test dataset TS75 with 75 proteins (can be found in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/btn583/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>) in protein&#x02013;DNA complexes was randomly selected from the DBP-374 dataset without the proteins of the PDNA-62 dataset. The other 299 proteins were designated as the training dataset TR299 for constructing prediction models.

Ho <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2007</xref>) proposed a hybrid method using a SVM in conjunction with evolutionary information of amino acid sequences in terms of their PSSMs for prediction of DNA-binding sites.

We repeated the process of constructing prediction models, based on the training dataset TR299 and which follow the same strategy as Ho's method except for the standard grid parameter search in our process. Putative binding residues in the dataset TS75 were then predicted. We constructed RF models on the TR299 dataset using exactly the same scheme as the original RF models and applied the models to predict putative DNA-binding residues in the test dataset TS75 whose SS information was predicted by the PREDATOR program (Frishman and Argos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1997</xref>). For all three classifiers in this paragraph, 3.5 &#x000c5; was designated as the cutoff distance in the definition of a binding residue.

However, 4.5 &#x000c5; is regarded as the cutoff distance in the definition of a binding residue in DP-Bind. The models constructed were also based on the PDNA-62 dataset, and predictions were performed using a profile of evolutionary conservation in terms of PSSMs of the input sequence automatically generated by the web server. The model provides three machine learning methods: SVM, KLR (kernel logistic regression) and PLR (penalized logistic regression). Putative DNA-binding residues were predicted by DP-Bind for the test dataset TS75, and the recommended encoding schemes were used and prediction results were received by E-mail (default). Here, we also trained other RF models on the TR299 dataset using exactly the same strategy as the original RF models, except that the training data instances were extracted according to the criterion of a cutoff distance of 4.5 &#x000c5; in the definition of a binding residue.

What about the performance of applying the RF model to predict non-binding proteins? For this purpose, we analyzed a set of 100 proteins that do not interact with DNA collected by Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (Wang and Brown, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2006a</xref>), and whose SS information was predicted by the PREDATOR program (Frishman and Argos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1997</xref>).

For direct comparison of the prediction of DNA binding and non-binding proteins by RF-based models, we examined fractions of the tree votes for the positive class (FVPs) of each data instance from the proteins in the dataset DBP-374 and the dataset NBP-350 including 350 non-binding proteins, namely, 100 xnon-binding proteins from Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (Wang and Brown, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2006</xref>) and a non-redundant set of 250 non-binding proteins obtained from Stawiski <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2003</xref>). The FVP values of the DBP-374 dataset are sourced from <xref ref-type="sec" rid="SEC3.1">Section 3.1</xref>. We computed the average of the FVPs of predicted positive samples (FVPs &#x02265; 1/6) of each protein in both datasets. The mean of all 374 averages of the DBP-374 dataset is 0.4135 with a 95% CI from 0.3977 to 0.430. However, the mean of the 350 non-binding proteins of the dataset NBP-350 is 0.2765 with a 95% CI from 0.2723 to 0.2807. A two-independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test was also implemented for all averages of the DBP-374 and those of the dataset NBP-350. The <italic>P</italic>-value was &#x0003c;0.001, which indicated that the prediction between DNA binding and non-binding proteins was significantly different.

All the CGI scripts of models were written in Perl 5.8.4 and the interface was designed using HTML. On the DBindR web page, users can copy/paste amino acid sequences in FASTA format and choose the prediction method (either RF or SVM). The RF and SVM models used for predicting new proteins were constructed from all the data instances in the processed DBP-374 dataset. The RF algorithm is implemented by the randomForest (version 4.5-18) R package (Liaw and Wiener, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2002</xref>), and the SVM algorithm was by the e1071 (version 1.5-16) R package (Dimitriadou <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2007</xref>). An E-mail address is required to receive the results. The program slides a window with length &#x003b2; = 11 along the input sequence (into a segment of amino acid sequences). Each window segment constitutes a sample and each sample will be mapped into a 319-dimension feature space reflecting a hybrid feature by combining evolutionary information of the amino acid sequence, the OBVs of the amino acids and SS information of the amino acids. The web server returns the predicted DNA-binding residues and non-binding residues along the input sequence, and marks them &#x02018;P&#x02019; and &#x02018;N&#x02019;.

The results indicate that the RF-reliant models have a prediction accuracy of 91.41% with MCC set at 0.70. To the best of our knowledge, until now, the RF method combined with a hybrid feature has been the most effective method for predicting binding residues in proteins from protein sequences without using 3D structural information, and the prediction results are useful to realize how proteins interact with DNA molecules. The results demonstrate that the hybrid feature contributes most to the excellent prediction performance. The prediction RI would be helpful to biologists for guiding selection of residue candidates in experimental studies of site-directed mutagenesis for functional DNA-binding proteins. A web server, called DBindR, has been developed for efficient online predictions. In the next step, we will attempt to classify protein&#x02013;DNA complexes by using the conventional motif-based classification and the structural and functional properties-based classification of DNA binding proteins, and then predict their DNA-binding sites in proteins and identify common properties and rules that govern protein&#x02013;DNA recognition.</p><p><italic>Funding</italic>: National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 60671018 and No. 60121101).
