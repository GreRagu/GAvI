The fact that they are produced in plants, may lower production costs considerably.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The human papillomaviruses (HPV) comprise a heterogeneous group of more than 130 epitheliotropic genotypes, 16 of which are considered "high-risk" types and linked with the development of malignant disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. High-risk types, HPV 16 and HPV 18, are the main etiological agents of cervical cancer, with HPV 16 being involved in about half of all cases of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. HPV are responsible for approximately half a million new cervical cancer cases every year and almost 250,000 deaths per year, most of them occurring in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Among the various HPV components, the major structural protein of the capsid, L1, has been the antigen of choice for the development of prophylactic vaccines. L1 can self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs), which are very efficient in inducing an immune response. VLP-induced antibodies provide protective immunity against challenge with infectious viruses in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Two L1-based, HPV vaccines have been licensed in several countries after demonstration of an acceptable benefit/risk profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], one (Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) contains two high-risk (16 and 18) and two low-risk (6 and 11) types and the other (Cervarix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) is composed of two high-risk types, 16 and 18.</p><p>Parenteral vaccines, such as that for HPV, are expensive to produce and costly to administer. Thus, many diseases that are controlled effectively in industrialized countries are controlled poorly at best in poor countries. A promising strategy for producing affordable and efficient vaccines involves the expression of recombinant immunogens in plants. Plants provide a number of advantages for production of recombinant proteins over conventional systems including low cost, increased safety and scalable production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. They are a potential source of a wide range of biopharmaceuticals that is not dependent upon downstream processing technology to ensure protein folding, particle assembly and stability. In consequence, a plant-based biopharmaceutical expression system makes possible either testing of an oral therapy strategy by simply feeding with edible plant tissues or purification of the compound from the plant, which would reduce processing costs. A number of antigens from different origins have been expressed in various plants and HPV antigens have been no exception. Plants such as tobacco, potato, tomato and Arabidopsis have been employed for the production of human and animal papilloma L1 VLPs, which appeared similar in size and structure to authentic papilloma virus VLPs as shown by electron microscopy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, plant-produced VLPs were immunogenic when administered in mice either orally or intraperitonally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, since capsid proteins are not expressed at detectable levels by HPV-transformed cells, therapeutic vaccines generally target the nonstructural early viral antigens. The E6 and E7 oncogenic proteins, which are critical to the induction and maintenance of cellular transformation and co-express in the majority of HPV-containing carcinomas, are potential targets in the development of an immunotherapy against HPV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although other early viral antigens show promise for vaccination against papillomas, therapeutic vaccines targeting E6 and E7 may provide the best opportunity to control HPV-associated malignancies. These proteins have been demonstrated to contain several reactive T-cell epitopes which may play a role as tumor rejection antigens in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Cell-mediated immunity responses to these epitopes correlates significantly with regression of disease and resolution of viral infection within 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Since HPV VLPs can be employed as vehicles to deliver epitopes or genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], we hypothesized that chimeric VLPs (cVLPs) containing L1 fused to T-cell epitopes from E6 and E7 might be able to elicit both neutralizing antibodies against the viral particle and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) activity against the epitopes and induce regression of disease and loss of HPV infection. In this work, we report for the first time the expression of a chimeric particle containing the HPV 16 L1 sequence and a string of T-cell epitopes from HPV 16 E6 and E7 fused to the C-terminus. The particle was expressed in tomato cells and was able to stimulate significant antibody and cell-mediated immune responses in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Tomato plant transformation with LI-E6/E7 fusion gene constructs</title><p>We transformed tomato cotyledons with the construct LI-E6/E7-2300 or with L1 alone via <italic>A. tumefaciens </italic>infection. We employed the modified L1 cDNA reported by Collier et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], in which the strong inhibitory elements located in the first 514 nucleotides of the L1 gene were modified. A synthetic peptide containing three E7 and one E6 epitopes mediating cytotoxic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] was fused to the C terminus of the optimized L1, which removed the last 34 amino acids at the 3' end. We recovered 9 plants for L1 and 5 for LI-E6/E7 on selective medium which were grown in the greenhouse to maturity and selfed. These plants were tested for NPTII expression. Their progeny was analyzed by Southern blot and employed for subsequent experiments. Of nine lines found to express L1 mRNA, only two presented a normal phenotype. The rest of the lines were not transferred to the greenhouse due to poor growth of tissue culture plantlets or because they showed stunted growth in the greenhouse and did not flower in time (data not shown). Of five lines expressing LI-E6/E7, we were able to recover only three.</p></sec><sec><title>L1 expression at the transcriptional and translational level</title><p>Integration of L1 or LI-E6/E7 fusion in the tomato lines was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization.

When we determined by ELISA the expression of L1-E6/E7 in T2 plants from one of our lines, we found that the levels in the fruit were similar to the parent plant (data not shown), indicating that expression of the transgene is stable through generations.

We were interested to determine whether the plant-based, optimized L1 fused to the string of epitopes was able to assemble into chimeric VLPs. To this end we employed electron microscopy. As Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows, VLPs of about 50&#x02013;60 nm in diameter were observed in protein extracts obtained from tomato lines containing L1-E6/E7 which looked similar identical to LI particles. Protein extracts derived from non-transfected tomato fruits did not show any particles.

Mice sera were collected 15 days after the last immunization and evaluated by ELISA. The results indicated that immunization with plant-based recombinant VLPs was associated with a significant serum antibody responses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The response was comparable to that obtained with an equivalent amount of commercial vaccine. Mice receiving only the adjuvant demonstrated no response at any time by ELISA.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Determination of the antibodies response of mice to VLPs by ELISA and hemmaglutination inhibition assay</bold>. Groups of C57BL/6 mice were immunized with Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>and with purified VLPs and cVLPs derived from tomato fruits. Serum was collected from each mice and used for: A, determination of antibodies against different types of VLPs by ELISA. Bars, mean and SE (n = 6). Sera dilution 1:100. B, hemagglutination inhibition assay: sera from C57BL/6 mice (n = 6 in all cases) immunized with Gardasil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, VLPs and cVLPs and the pre-immune group were assayed at 1:1600, 1:800, 1:400, 1:200 and 1:100 dilutions as described in the text.

VLPs incubated with erythrocytes were used as positive controls for the hemagglutination assay.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-422X-6-2-5"/></fig><p>To investigate whether the antibodies induced by the particles were neutralizing, we employed an indirect assay. The assay was based on the fact that VLPs interact with cell receptors present in the membranes of erythrocytes, resulting in agglutination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore we performed serial dilutions of mice sera and each dilution was incubated primarily with purified VLPs and subsequently with erythrocytes from mouse. As shown in figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), antibodies from mice immunized with VLP, cVLP and commercial vaccine were able to inhibit hemagglutination completely from dilution 1:400. Once again, inhibition of hemagglutination of the plant-based VLPs was comparable to that of the commercial vaccine. In contrast, sera from mice immunized with adjuvant alone did not inhibit agglutination at any dilution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cytotoxic activity of T cells obtained from mice immunized with VLPs</title><p>In order to investigate the cellular immune response of mice immunized with plant-based VLPs, T-CD8+ cells were isolated from spleens and incubated in vitro with purified VLPs in the presence of IL-2. Subsequently, CTL activity was determined on a tumor epithelial cell line from mouse lung co-transfected with E6 and E7 (from HPV 16) and c-Ha-ras, denominated TC-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] as well as on TC-1 cells expressing the L1 HPV 16 gene (TC-1/L1). As Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> shows, only T-CD8+ cells derived from mice immunized with cVLPs were able to lyse TC-1 cells, whereas T-CD8+ cells from mice immunized with VLP did not present this activity. However, when TC-1/L1 cells were employed, both cVLPs and VLPs were able to lise TC-1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Similar results were obtained when T-CD8+ cells from mice immunized with commercial vaccine were incubated with TC-1/L1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). These results suggested that immunization with both types of plant-based VLPs elicit the generation of T cells specific to epitopes from L1 or from E6/E7 insert. To investigate further this possibility, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with the epitope RAHYNIVTF derived from E7, which is included in the cVLPs. As can be observed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, T-CD8+ cells obtained from the spleen of these mice were also able to lyse TC-1 cells, which confirms that CTL activity of cVLPs is conferred by the string of epitopes.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Immunization with VLPs and cVLPs induce cytotoxic specific T-lymphocytes in C57BL/6 mice</bold>.

There have been a few instances of chimeric VLPs produced in other systems (baculovirus, yeasts, <italic>E. coli</italic>) but not in plants.</p><p>Only a low number of transgenic plants containing the L1 constructs could be recovered, suggesting that L1 expression may interfere with plant growth and viability. Similar results had been obtained previously in potato expressing L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Since expression of native or plant codon optimized L1 was problematic in plants, resulting in low expression levels, we had decided to employ the optimized L1 cDNA reported by Collier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], since the highest expression in plants had involved a codon-optimized gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The levels of expression obtained in this work (0.05% &#x02013; 0.1% TSP) were higher or comparable to what had been reported in previous works, 23 ng/g, 0.2% TSP and .034&#x02013;.076% TSP in potato and tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], but they are not comparable to what Maclean et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] obtained using chloroplast transformation (11% TSP). Nevertheless, we were still able to purify VLPs in sufficient amounts to perform the immunization experiments.</p><p>HPV L1 VLPs can tolerate foreign peptides within the surface-exposed areas. Regions of the C terminus can be deleted and replaced with heterologous amino acids without loss of VLP structure. Muller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] removed the last 34 amino acids from the C terminus of HPV 16 L1 and replaced them with an E7 fragment of 50 amino acids and the VLPs could still assemble. Furthermore, it had been reported that up to 60 amino acids could be cloned fused to the C-terminus of L1, and VLPs would still be formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We removed the last 34 amino acids from the C terminus, inserting 50 amino acids and the particles assembled adequately. Analysis of the tomato lines obtained showed that they contained only one copy of the transgene, whereas the mRNA of VLPs and cVLPs accumulated to high levels in fruits of all lines. A band displaying the same size as that obtained from the commercial vaccine was detectable by specific antibodies in fruit from all lines indicating successful expression in tomato. The plant-produced VLPs were able to induce neutralizing antibodies in mice immunized intraperitonally as demonstrated by a hemagglutinin inhibition assay. Previously L1-based VLPs alone had been produced in plants and demonstrated to be immunogenic in mice when administered either orally or intraperitonally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our results are confirmatory of those findings but it was important to demonstrate that our chimeric particles also possess prophylactic as well as therapeutic properties (see below). Interestingly, the E6 T-cell epitope employed in this work, had not been included in cVLPs before.</p><p>Since we are interested in producing a prophylactic/therapeutic preparation it was important to investigate whether the presence of the string of epitopes could elicit any T cell cytotoxic activity. Previously, Castellanos et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] had tested a series of different epitopes from E6 and E7 HPV-18 and found that only two of them (from E7) were able to induce cell lysis in vitro. Our approach is different in that we combined a prophylactic/therapeutic preparation. The epitopes employed in this work had been reported as tumor rejection antigens, causing regression of disease and resolution of viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our results indicate that immunization with plant-based cVLPs elicits the generation of CTL activity against the epitopes present in the particle. This conclusion is supported by the results of immunization with the E7 epitope RAHYNIVTF alone which yielded similar results to those obtained with immunization with cVLPS. VLPs alone or the commercial vaccine did not present this activity. These results are in agreement with previous experiments using cVLPs prepared in baculovirus or <italic>E. coli</italic>. For example, Schafer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] inserted 60 N-terminal amino acids of the HPV-16 E7 protein into the C-terminus of L1. These chimeric particles induced conformational antibodies against L1 and a robust CTL response against E7 in mice. Kuck et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] produced in baculovirus HPV 16 cVLPs containing L1 fused to the first 60 amino acids from E7 and were able to not only induce L1-specific antibodies but also L1- and E7-specific CTL responses after DNA vaccination. Bian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] using a similar approach, produced in <italic>E. coli </italic>HPV-16 capsomers containing the first 60 amino acids from E7. These capsomeres were able to induce conformational and neutralizing antibodies against HPV virus-like particles and trigger cell-mediated specific immune responses against the L1 and E7 peptides. Freyschmidt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] prepared HPV 16 cVLPs L1-E7 fusion proteins and in preclinical studies the cVLPs were shown to induce neutralizing antibodies and L1- and E7-specific T cell responses. Chimeric VLPs with L1 and E7 have been employed in clinical trials but there was a poor match between the clinical response and the immune response induced within the individual patients [for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]]. For that reason, Freyschmidt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] emphasized the need of improved immunogenicity in future clinical trials and to that end they employed lipopolysaccharides, unmethylated CpG motifs and sorbitol, which substantially increased the immunogenicity of cVLPs.</p><p>Chimeric VLPs have also been prepared by fusing L1 to HPV genes such as L2, E1 and E2. However, the use of these genes for therapeutic purposes is still somewhat controversial because the T cell response to them is not too well defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In this work, we decided to employ well defined T-cell epitopes from E6 and E7 mainly because of their proven effects and because the immune response to some of these epitopes had been reported not to be HPV type-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This approach presents the additional advantage that the length of the fused insert to L1 can be kept within the minimum necessary to allow formation of VLPs by a judicious choice of epitopes. The order of the epitopes seems to be important. A specific order of epitopes may have dramatic may effects and altering that order may boost or diminish the response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It remains to be determined whether the CTL response can be boosted by altering the order of our epitopes. HPV VLPs have been postulated as ideal vehicles to deliver epitopes or genes and for that reason a wide range of foreign peptides have been fused and expressed as chimeric VLPs in different systems or administered as DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Many of this cVLPS have shown antitumoral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Cellular immune responses are essential in controlling cervical cancer and in most cases cVLPs are able to fully activate dendritic cells, and are subsequently capable of inducing endogenously processed, epitope-specific human T-cell responses in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Dendritic cells are the most potent inducers of immune responses and play a central role in VLP-induced immunity. Hence, cVLPs may prove fundamental for the development of therapeutic vaccination.</p><p>An ideal HPV vaccine should be prophylactic as well as therapeutic. Our results demonstrate for the first time the production in plants of chimeric VLPs containing a L1-based VLPs fused to a string of epitopes from E6 and E7 proteins, which were able to elicit humoral and CTL activity. The use of plants for production of a cost-effective, efficient HPV vaccine remains a very attractive possibility, currently investigated by several groups, including ours. As Freyschmidt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] indicate, inclusion of an appropriate adjuvant may alleviate the problem of low immunogenicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We report for the first time the expression in plants of a HPV 16 L1-based cVLPs containing a string of T-cell epitopes from HPV 16 E6 and E7 fused to the C-terminus. The chimeric particles were able to induce neutralizing antibody and a significant cytotoxic T-lymphocytes activity. Experiments in vivo are in progress to determine whether the chimeric particles are able to induce regression of disease and resolution of viral infection in mice. Chimeric particles of the type described in this work may potentially be the basis for developing prophylactic/therapeutic vaccines. The fact that they are produced in plants, may lower production costs considerably.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Construction of the chimeric VLP and tomato transfection</title><p>An HPV-16 L1 sequence in which inhibitory sequences had been modified at the 5' end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] was amplified by PCR using specific primers and cloned into pCAMBIA 2301 between the promoter and terminator of 35S CaMV.
