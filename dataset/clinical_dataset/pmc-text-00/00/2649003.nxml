The presence of potential HIV target cells in prostate tissues was investigated using immunohistochemistry. The infection of prostate explants following exposures with HIV-1 R5, R5X4 and X4 strains was analyzed through the measure of RT activity in culture supernatants, the quantification of HIV DNA in the explants and the detection of HIV RNA+ cells <italic>in situ</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall prostate characteristics were retained for 2<sup>1/2 </sup>weeks in culture. Numerous potential HIV-1 target cells were detected in the prostate stroma. Whilst HIV-1 R5<sub>SF162 </sub>strain consistently productively infected prostatic T lymphocytes and macrophages, the prototypic X4<sub>IIIB </sub>strain and a primary R5X4 strain showed less efficient replication in this organ.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The BPH prostate is a site of HIV-1 R5 replication that could contribute virus to semen. A limited spreading of HIV-1 X4 and R5X4 in this organ could participate to the preferential sexual transmission of HIV-1 R5 strains.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Although semen represents the foremost vector of HIV-1 dissemination worldwide, the origin of the infected leukocytes and free viral particles contaminating the seminal plasma is still unclear. Semen represents a viral compartment distinct from the blood (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]), strongly suggesting the existence of productive sources within the male genital tract. The male reproductive tract could constitute a sanctuary for HIV-1 replication, since HIV-1 can persist in the semen of seropositive men on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the absence of detectable levels of viral RNA in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Knowing the sources contributing virus to semen is essential to promoting the design of therapies aimed at eradicating virus from semen.</p><p>Semen is composed of secretions and cells from the testes, epididymides, prostate, seminal vesicles and urethral glands. Earlier studies showed that vasectomy has little impact on seminal shedding of HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], indicating that testes and epididymides are not the main sources of viral load in semen. The prostate could represent an important source of virus in the semen, since prostate secretions constitute 30% of the seminal fluid and the human prostate is frequently inflammed, encompassing leukocytic infiltrates that may represent target cells for HIV infection (for a review, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). We recently demonstrated that the prostate of asymptomatic macaques is productively infected by SIV and displays higher level of infection than the testes and the epididymides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In human, indirect evidence suggests that the prostate is infected and constitutes an early viral reservoir. Thus, prostatic massages performed on asymptomatic HIV-1+ men with no detectable seminal viral load induce the release of virus in the semen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and the expressed prostatic secretions from HIV-1+ men with or without ART are consistently positive for HIV RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, for obvious clinical and ethical reasons, in-depth investigations of HIV infection of the prostate of HIV+ asymptomatic men have never been performed.</p><p><italic>In vitro </italic>studies using a number of different human organs, including the testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], have proved invaluable for improving the understanding of HIV pathogenesis. To test the hypothesis that the human prostate represents a source of virus in semen, we used an organotypic culture of prostate tissue obtained from men with benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH), a common non-malignant pathology, to assess whether the resident immune cells or other cell types present in this organ are susceptible to infection by HIV-1 strains with various co-receptor requirements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>The following reagents were used: DMEM, RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Cergy-Pontoise, France), fetal calf serum (FCS), sodium pyruvate (Eurobio, Courtaboeuf, France), glutamine (Gibco BRL), insulin, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, dihydrotestosterone, phytohemagglutinin (Sigma, Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Quentin Fallavier, France), penicillin-streptomycin (Eurobio) and interleukin-2 (Boehringer-Mannheim, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies, plasmids and cell lines</title><p>The following mouse monoclonal antibodies against human proteins and matching isotype controls were used: anti-CD68 (clone KP1), -CD3 (clone F.7.2.38)(7 &#x003bc;g/ml), &#x02013; HLA-DR (clone TAL.1B5), -Ki-67 (clone MIB-1) (DAKO, Trappes, France), -PSA (clones ER-PR8 and PA05 from Neomarkers), and -CD4 (clone 1F6, Novocastra, Newcastle, UK) with mouse IgG1 (DAKO), anti-CCR5 (clone 45523) and IgG2b (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-CXCR4 (clone 12G5; Dr. J.

Immediately following surgery, prostate tissues were placed at 4&#x000b0;C in fresh medium and processed within one hour. The benign pathological status was confirmed by histological examination. Prostate tissue from the transition zone and the central zone was dissected into 3-mm<sup>3 </sup>fragments, and two explants were transferred onto a polyethylene terephtalate (PET) insert in a well of a 12-well tissue culture plate (Falcon Labware; Becton-Dickinson and Co., Lincoln Park, NJ) containing 1 ml of media (DMEM supplemented with antibiotics, 10% FCS, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 1 mmol/L glutamine, 100 ng/ml vitamin A, 200 ng/ml vitamin E, 50 ng/ml vitamin C, 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin, and 800 ng/ml 5&#x003b1;-dyhydrotestosterone).

Histological examination of prostatic fragments revealed that the tissue architecture was maintained during the 17 day culture period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> versus F). Staining for &#x003b1; smooth actin before culturing revealed the presence of numerous smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts as well as unstained stromal cells (i.e. fibroblasts, leukocytes and endothelial cells). After 17 days of culture, whilst the same global profile of staining was observed, a diminution of the number of stromal cells, mainly in the centre of the explants was noticed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> versus G). Epithelial basal cells (p63+, PSA-) surrounding the acini were maintained throughout the culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, H</xref>) and were seen encapsulating the explants from day 4 of culture (data not shown). Luminal columnar epithelial cells (PSA+, p63-) maintained their ability to produce PSA for up to 4 days of culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> versus I). After 8 days of culture, PSA expression in these cells became undetectable, although PSA positive secretions were still found in acini lumen by day 17 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>).

Here, we used an organotypic culture of prostate tissue from HIV-negative men with benign prostatic hypertophy (BPH) to investigate infection by R5, R5X4 and X4 HIV-1 strains and to determine the nature of the target cells within this organ.</p><p>BPH is an extremely common disease (for a review, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). Starting from 35 years of age, its frequency increases with age, and it affects 50 to 75% of men over 50 years old. It leads to an enlarged prostate which although benign and non-malignant may necessitate surgery to eliminate discomfort. Most BPH lesions develop in the transition and central zones of the prostate and are composed of epithelial, muscular and/or stromal hyperplasia. Inflammatory infiltrates are often present in and around the glandular or fibromuscular BPH nodules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In our BPH tissues, T lymphocytes (mean of 220 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>), mainly stromal CD4+, were more numerous than CD68+ myeloid cells and were found either scattered or in foci. These results are in agreement with previous qualitative and quantitative studies on immune cell populations within BPH prostates, showing the predominance of T lymphocytes (mean of 195 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>, mainly stromal memory CD4+T cells and a few intraepithelial CD8+ cells) over macrophages and B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Normal prostate (i.e. from asymptomatic prostate disease-free men) contains scattered stromal and intraepithelial T and B lymphocytes, macrophages and mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], but also frequently displays focal accumulation of CD4+T lymphocytes in the stroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As a matter of fact, most adult prostate tissues, with or without prostatic pathology, contain various extent of inflammatory infiltrates, most commonly composed of a majority of stromal T cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The source of intraprostatic inflammation is often unknown but might be caused by dietary factors, hormonal exposure variations, infection, or cell injury (for a review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]).</p><p>The culture conditions selected for the organotypic culture of human prostate that we developed from BPH tissues were based both on our own experience of organ culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and on previous descriptions of prostate organ culture selected from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The culturing method of using well inserts was chosen for its ease of manipulation in the context of a high security laboratory, as opposed to other methods which required specific material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The culture allowed for the preservation of the overall tissue architecture and the maintenance of all the prostatic cell types for 2.5 weeks ex vivo. Both normal and hyperplasic glands were observed before and after culturing. No increased proliferation of any specific cell type was observed after culturing. The constraint of working on explants of very small size in order to preserve tissue integrity did not allow for accurate quantification of immune cells throughout the culture. However, we unequivocally found that all the immune cell types identified before culturing were still present by day 17.</p><p>We demonstrated here for the first time that human prostate from men with BPH is selectively infected by HIV-1 and releases infectious virions. Infected cells were mainly localized within the stroma and were rarely found within the epithelium, whether hyperplasic or normal. Their phenotype corresponded to either lymphocytes or macrophages, which, as previously evidenced by us and others, can be inserted within the epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Epithelial cells in the BPH prostate explants never stained positive for HIV receptors CD4, CXCR4 or CCR5 in immunohistochemistry. This confirms an <italic>in vitro </italic>study showing an absence of CD4, CXCR4 or CCR5 surface expression and the lack of productive infection by either R5 or X4 virus strains of epithelial cells isolated from normal prostates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, unlike the renal epithelium that supports HIV replication <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], the prostatic epithelium does not constitute a site of active HIV infection.</p><p>The most efficiently and consistently replicating HIV-1 strain in prostate tissues was the prototypic R5<sub>SF162</sub>. Prostate cultures were also susceptible to infection by a dual tropic primary isolate; albeit replication of the R5X4 virus was much lower than the R5 strain (which could reflect the lower titre of R5X4 viral stock) and was variable depending on the patients. As assessed by RT activity measurement, infected cells were readily detected <italic>in situ </italic>and the viral particles recovered from infected prostate supernatants were able to subsequently infect PBMCs. In contrast, despite a higher titre of viral stock, X4<sub>IIIB </sub>spread in the prostate tissue was somewhat inefficient. This was demonstrated by the absence (or the very low level) of RT activity in infected culture supernatants after 17 days of culture, the scarce detection of infected cells in the tissues, and the fact that supernatants of prostate explants exposed to X4 were rarely able to induce infection of PBMCs. In addition, whilst in the prostate explants infected with R5<sub>SF162 </sub>HIV-1 DNA rose significantly from day 7 onwards, a delayed and much lower increase was observed within the explants exposed to X4<sub>IIIB</sub>. A longer duration of prostate culture may have allowed for a rise in X4 production, as suggested by the increase in X4 DNA towards the end of the culture period; however, since the prostate explant morphologies started to be disrupted after 17 days, the culture was not carried out any further. A similarly favoured replication of R5 over X4 strains has been described in foreskin, cervical, skin epidermal and fetal thymus explants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In contrast, whilst rectosigmoid explants supported efficient replication by both R5 and X4 strains, tonsil explants, which displayed low numbers of CCR5+ cells, were less efficiently infected by R5 strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In foreskin, a predominance of CCR5 over CXCR4 expression by the tissue immune cells was observed, and this could explain the X4 restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In our system, CXCR4 was readily detected and, in fact, CXCR4+ cells outnumbered CCR5+ cells. Although differences in antibody sensitivities may have led to an underestimation of CCR5+ cells, the restriction in X4 replication cannot be inferred as emerging from a lack of co-receptor expression. However, we cannot rule out that CXCR4+ cells in the prostate are mainly inactivated/naive CD4+T cells and/or CD8+T lymphocytes, both refractory to productive infection. Another hypothesis is that the cytokine environment of the prostate tissue restricts CXCR4-viral entry and/or spread. Thus, a high expression of the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 (SDF-1) could impair X4 infection of prostate tissue, as previously described for the female genital mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, the fact that viral DNA accumulation in prostate explants was similar for R5<sub>SF162 </sub>and X4<sub>IIIB </sub>up to 7 days post-infection indicated that both strains entered target cells and retrotranscribed their RNA genome following virus exposure of prostate explants. Afterwards, only R5 efficiently propagated in the explants, whilst a much more modest rise in DNA was observed for X4<sub>IIIB </sub>after 17 days. This suggests that the limited X4 spread in prostate tissue is not due to an entry inhibition but rather resulted from either a slower replication kinetic or a more restricted number of cells that supported efficient replication following entry. In cervical explants, a post-entry block due to the non-activated status of T lymphocytes was described for lab-adapted X4 and primary isolates of X4, R5X4, or R5. This block was compensated for in the prototypic R5<sub>BaL </sub>strain by its efficient spreading in macrophages, while infecting only a few T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Although the prototypic R5<sub>SF162 </sub>strain used in our study can also efficiently spread in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], the fact that the main infected cell type for both R5 and R5X4 was T lymphocytes, indicated that the difference between R5/R5X4 and X4 strains was not due to exclusive replication of the formers in macrophages, a cell type that X4 strains cannot productively infect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. One hypothesis is that the limited replication of X4<sub>IIIB </sub>is due to a sub-optimal level of activation of its target cells. Thus, sub-optimally stimulated CD4+T cells have been shown to only support the early steps of X4 viral replication. Whilst X4 replication in lymphocytes is a function of the time interval from mitogenic stimulation, R5 viruses require less stringent conditions of T-cell activation and are able to replicate in all subsets of sub-optimally activated T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Since inflammatory infiltrates of BPH prostate tissues are mainly constituted of chronically activated CD4+ T cells, the activation status of those cells (i.e chronically rather than acutely activated) may allow efficient R5, but no X4, replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrated that the prostate is a site of R5 virus replication through the infection of the immune cells present in the tissue. The less efficient spread of HIV-1 X4 virus observed in the prostate explants could contribute to the preferential sexual transmission of HIV-1 R5 strains. Whether restricted X4 replication occurs in the prostate of HIV patients awaits further investigations, since different conditions such as the level of immune cell activation and the cytokine environment may modify X4 virus replication in the prostate <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing
