TE cells are restricted in their differentiation potential towards the trophoblast lineage that is essential for formation of the placenta. By contrast, cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) lose their capacity to differentiate into trophoblast derivatives, but remain pluripotent and give rise to all cell types of the embryo proper as well as to extraembryonic endoderm and mesoderm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived from the ICM of blastocyst-stage embryos<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>.

Conversely, trophoblast stem (TS) cells, derived from the TE, differentiate into all trophoblast subtypes of the placenta, but are excluded from embryonic tissues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>. Thus, the stem cell populations derived from the blastocyst stably retain the cell lineage restrictions that are imposed by this stage.</p><p id="P6">The initial cell lineage specification is established by key transcription factors such as Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, as well as Cdx2 and Eomes, that are capable of defining embryonic and trophoblast lineage identity, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>. Once fixed, lineage determination must be accompanied by epigenetic modifications that ensure the stable inheritance of cell fate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>. It is particularly important to determine how lineage-specific transcription factor networks interact with different epigenetic marking systems in order to achieve this stability. One of the earliest global epigenetic marks that distinguishes the ICM and TE lineages is DNA methylation: ICM cells become <italic>de novo</italic> methylated in early blastocysts while TE cells remain hypomethylated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>, and this global difference in methylation between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues is maintained throughout development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>. Indicating a functional role of this differential methylation pattern, expression of few markers of differentiated trophoblast has been observed in embryoid bodies derived from <italic>Dnmt</italic>-deficient (and therefore hypomethylated) ES cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>. Here, we have examined in detail the role of DNA methylation in the stability of embryonic lineage determination. We show that ES cells and cells of the embryo proper that are deficient in methylation can differentiate into trophoblast derivatives, progressing in an orderly fashion from stem cells towards giant cells. DNA methylation-mediated silencing of a trophoblast-specific transcription factor, <italic>Elf5</italic>, normally restricts this differentiation pathway. The identification of this epigenetically regulated gatekeeper provides an explanation for the early, definitive nature of embryonic and trophoblast cell lineage separation.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Trophoblast from <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryonic cells</title><p id="P7">To evaluate whether DNA methylation is essential for the stability of embryonic cell lineage determination, we examined whether trophoblast differentiation occurs from ES cells deficient in DNA methylation due to deletion of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, <italic>Dnmt1</italic>. Formation of trophoblast giant cells, a morphologically distinct placental cell type, was observed only sporadically when <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells were grown in standard ES cell medium. In sharp contrast, &#x0223c; 25% of all <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells differentiated into trophoblast giant cells upon culture in TS cell conditions as assessed by morphological criteria and by marker gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, b</xref>). In a time course experiment where <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells were subjected to TS cell conditions for 2-12 days, trophoblast stem cell markers <italic>Eomes</italic> and <italic>Cdx2</italic> were the first to be detected, followed by ectoplacental cone and spongiotrophoblast markers <italic>Ascl2</italic> and <italic>Tpbpa</italic>, and subsequently giant cell-expressed genes <italic>Pl1 (Prl3d1)</italic> and <italic>Pl2 (Prl3b1;</italic>&#x0200b; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). This sequence of expression was comparable to that observed when TS cells undergo differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. No significant trophoblast differentiation or marker expression was observed with wildtype ES cells grown under TS cell conditions. Trophoblast differentiation was not restricted to methylation-deficient ES cells, but also occurred in <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos <italic>in vivo</italic>. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed a striking up-regulation of markers for intermediate diploid trophoblast (<italic>Ascl2, Tpbpa</italic>) and trophoblast giant cells (<italic>Pl1, Pl2</italic>) in E9.5 <italic>Dnmt1</italic>-deficient embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>), thus reflecting a mid-to-late stage in the time course of trophoblast transdifferentiation from embryonic cells. The spatial distribution and morphology of these ectopically differentiating trophoblast cells was determined by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization where cells positive for <italic>Tpbpa, Plf</italic> (<italic>Prl2c2</italic>), and <italic>Pl1</italic> were detected in <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> but not wildtype embryos, with giant cell marker-expressing cells exhibiting an enlarged cell size compared to surrounding embryonic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d, e</xref>). These data clearly demonstrate the ectopic differentiation of trophoblast derivatives in <italic>Dnmt1</italic>-depleted embryos and ES cells, showing that appropriate DNA methylation levels are crucial for maintenance of the embryonic lineage.</p><p id="P8">The major difference between ES and TS cell culture conditions is the absence of LIF and presence of FGF4 in TS cell medium. Therefore, we investigated whether the FGF signalling receptor in trophoblast stem cells, Fgfr2c<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, was expressed concomitantly with trophoblast differentiation. Like <italic>Cdx2, Fgfr2c</italic> was activated in <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, but not wildtype, ES cells upon growth in TS cell medium. Importantly, wildtype ES cells could be induced to express trophoblast genes at levels similar to those observed in <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells by addition of the methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a, b</xref>). As in <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells, activation of trophoblast markers coincided with the appearance of giant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Interestingly, azacytidine-treatment of <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells did not lead to a further increase in trophoblast stem cell-specific <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Fgfr2c</italic> expression but instead caused an up-regulation of markers of differentiated trophoblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>), suggesting critical methylation threshold levels for trophoblast stem cell maintenance.</p><p id="P9">We next asked if trophoblast differentiation was triggered by down-regulation of Oct4, since loss of Oct4 expression in ES cells leads to transdifferentiation into trophoblast<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. Interestingly, even after six days of culture in TS cell medium most cells co-expressed Cdx2 and Oct4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2d</xref>). This pattern suggests that demethylation of ES cells has expanded their developmental plasticity to include both extraembryonic and embryonic fate, rather than switching fate to an exclusive extraembryonic one. It may also reflect the pattern in compacting morulae where Oct4 levels remain high in both Cdx2<sup>+</sup> and Cdx2<sup>-</sup> cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>.

The non-random appearance of giant cells indicates a clonal origin of trophoblast derivatives in <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells and suggests that they recapitulate a differentiation pathway comparable to that of the trophoblast lineage proper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title><italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells contribute to the TE</title><p id="P11">Since hypomethylation caused loss of embryonic lineage restriction in embryos and ES cells, we examined whether <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells could directly contribute to the TE in aggregation chimeras.

We thus carried out a genome-wide screen for promoter methylation by meDIP array hybridization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>, comparing ES with TS cells. We screened for promoters that exhibited higher methylation levels in ES cells compared to TS cells. A very small number of candidate promoters of this type were identified (see Methods); intriguingly, however, after validation by Sequenom&#x000ae; mass array technology only one gene with a robust difference in methylation was confirmed, <italic>Elf5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>; Supplementary Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). <italic>Elf5</italic> encodes a transcription factor of the Ets family that plays a pivotal role in the trophoblast lineage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>.

In fact, <italic>Elf5</italic> was the earliest and most significantly induced trophoblast marker in the time course of ES-to-trophoblast transdifferentiation and was expressed in derivatives of every single cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a-c</xref>; Supplementary Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). <italic>Elf5</italic> was also strongly activated upon treatment of wildtype ES cells with 5-azacytidine (Supplementary Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). To further test the direct relationship between hypomethylation and expression of <italic>Elf5</italic> and the activation of trophoblast markers, we examined other hypomethylated ES cell models null for <italic>Np95, Dnmt3a/b</italic> or <italic>Cxxc1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>.

Thus, <italic>Elf5</italic> expression is associated with a loss of embryonic cell lineage determination irrespective of how promoter demethylation is achieved. Consistent with the observations of Cdx2 and Oct4 co-expression shown above, activation of <italic>Elf5</italic> at earliest stages in the transdifferentiation cascade was independent of Oct4 repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p><p id="P16">If expression of hypomethylated <italic>Elf5</italic> was responsible for trophoblast differentiation from embryonic cells, <italic>Elf5</italic> might directly activate the trophoblast stem cell determinants <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic>. Indeed both the <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic> promoters contain the core binding motif for the transcription factor Elf5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that forced expression of <italic>Elf5</italic> in wildtype ES cells resulted in a strong induction of <italic>Eomes</italic> as early as 24h after transfection. Likewise, <italic>Cdx2</italic> expression was significantly (&#x0003e;3-fold) activated after 24h but peaked somewhat later after 2-3 days of transfection with <italic>Elf5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6e</xref>). We confirmed that Elf5 was able to activate the <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic> promoters in co-transfection experiments of <italic>Elf5</italic> with reporter constructs, and that conversely, Cdx2 (and likely Eomes) could also activate the <italic>Elf5</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6f</xref>, Supplementary Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S3</xref>).

Hence, ectopic expression of <italic>Elf5</italic> directly induces trophoblast stem cell determinants and thereby initiates the trophoblast differentiation cascade in cells of the embryonic lineage. Importantly, this differentiation pathway depends on Elf5 since trophoblast marker activation is significantly decreased in hypomethylated ES cells in which <italic>Elf5</italic> expression is diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>).</p><p id="P17">These data establish that Elf5 is essential to reinforce the expression of critical trophoblast stem cell factors, which provides an explanation for the observed loss of <italic>Cdx2</italic> expression in <italic>Elf5</italic>-mutant conceptuses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>. As indicated by the immunostaining patterns of blastocyst outgrowths and early conceptuses, however, this transcriptional activator function of Elf5 is limited to a relatively narrow spatio-temporal window since <italic>Elf5</italic> expression is sustained in diploid trophoblast cells that have ceased to express <italic>Cdx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Consequently, stable expression of <italic>Elf5</italic> in wildtype ES cells, as well as continued culture of <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells in TS cell conditions, resulted in the widespread differentiation of cells with trophoblast (giant) cell morphology, but did not allow the establishment of self-renewing TS cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7b, c</xref>; Supplementary Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Thus, Elf5 creates a cell lineage-restricting niche at the critical interface between promotion and loss of the self-renewing capacity of trophoblast stem cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P18">In this study we have made three significant observations: First, ES cells deficient in DNA methylation can differentiate efficiently into the trophoblast lineage.

Second, the transcription factor Elf5 binds to and positively regulates the <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic> promoters, establishing a positive feedback loop which is critical for the maintenance of the trophoblast stem cell population. Third, the <italic>Elf5</italic> gene is hypomethylated in the trophoblast lineage, so that the feedback loop is sustained and leads to expansion of the stem cell compartment and subsequent differentiation. By contrast, <italic>Elf5</italic> is stably repressed by DNA methylation in the embryonic lineage; as a result any induction of trophoblast cell fate mediated by stochastic expression of <italic>Cdx2</italic> or <italic>Eomes</italic> cannot be sustained in this compartment.</p><p id="P19">Several studies have demonstrated that epigenetic regulation through Polycomb group proteins is essential to maintain the pluripotent state within the embryonic lineage in ES cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>. Here, we show that DNA methylation functions as a lineage barrier between the embryonic and trophoblast lineage compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7d</xref>). Consequently, hypomethylated ES cells can adopt a trophoblast cell fate. It is important to note, however, that methylation-deficient ES cells have not simply switched from an ES to a trophoblast fate, but have broadened their potency to include both an embryonic and extraembryonic fate. Thus, they adopt a state comparable to an earlier developmental stage prior to lineage commitment, and this interpretation is consistent with the observed overlapping staining patterns of lineage markers. While methylation-deficient ES cells are able to express trophoblast determinants <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic> (as well as <italic>Fgfr2</italic>), the promoters of none of these genes are methylated in wildtype ES cells. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide screen for promoter methylation differences between ES and TS cells. This analysis revealed that the global methylation asymmetry observed between the embryonic and trophoblast lineage is not reflected by the methylation profile of gene promoters on a large scale. The major differences in methylation between the two lineages are therefore likely to be located in non-genic regions such as, for example, centromeric heterochromatin. These observations are similar to the X chromosome where global hypermethylation but promoter-specific hypomethylation is observed on the active X<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>. However, by specifically screening for gene promoters with higher methylation levels in ES cells, we identified <italic>Elf5</italic> as the gatekeeper gene that is methylated in ES cells but unmethylated in TS cells. <italic>Elf5</italic> is activated through Fgf-Fgfr signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> and in turn activates <italic>Eomes</italic> and <italic>Cdx2</italic>. When the <italic>Elf5</italic> promoter is methylated, low levels of expression of <italic>Eomes</italic> and/or <italic>Cdx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) remain inconsequential because the transcriptional loop is interrupted at the level of <italic>Elf5.</italic> The robust positive feedback loop created by Elf5 in the trophoblast stem cell niche allows this compartment to expand in a temporally defined window. Consequently, this cell population is lost and <italic>Cdx2</italic> expression cannot be sustained in <italic>Elf5</italic>-mutants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>. This compartment can also be established by overexpression of <italic>Cdx2</italic> or <italic>Eomes</italic> in ES cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> which we show is independent of <italic>Elf5</italic> demethylation at early stages, but over prolonged periods leads to <italic>Elf5</italic> demethylation and expression thereby maintaining the feedback loop and allowing progression of the trophoblast differentiation pathway (Supplementary Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S4</xref>). Normally, the feedback loop established by Elf5 is temporally restricted to a few cell divisions, thereby positioning Elf5 at the interface between reinforcing trophoblast fate and onset of differentiation. This may be due to the gradual loss of other regulatory factors required for <italic>Cdx2</italic> (or <italic>Eomes</italic>) expression. Consequently, Elf5 can induce trophoblast differentiation from ES cells but cannot, unlike Cdx2, convert them into continuously self-renewing TS cell lines. We cannot exclude that there may be additional gatekeeper genes such as <italic>Elf5</italic> which are methylated in ES cells and the epiblast, but our screen was exhaustive and validation studies show that robust methylation differences are detected reliably<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>.</p><p id="P20">In the absence of silencing by DNA methylation or in a force-expression system, Elf5 has trophoblast-determining functions due its capacity to activate <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic>. Within the normal developmental context, however, Elf5 acts downstream of the trophoblast determinants <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic> as well as the recently identified <italic>Tead4</italic> which has been shown to induce <italic>Cdx2</italic>, making it the gene currently at the top of the extraembryonic fate cascade<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref>. A gatekeeper function for such a relatively late-acting gene may at first appear counterintuitive. However, the temporal position of Elf5 in the trophoblast determination cascade correlates perfectly with the developmental fixation of lineage restriction and specifically allows the plasticity and regulation that is characteristic of early mammalian development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>. Thus, individual blastomeres are still able to cross lineages and expression of lineage &#x02018;markers&#x02019; remains mosaic until the mid-blastocyst stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>. Only slightly later, <italic>Elf5</italic> expression in the extraembryonic ectoderm reinforces extraembryonic cell fate, while the inability to activate <italic>Elf5</italic> in the epiblast due to promoter methylation restricts its descendants to the embryonic cell fate. The late-acting function of Elf5 is in line with its position downstream of lineage-determining transcription factors at the interface of stem cell self-renewal and onset of differentiation.</p><p id="P21">To what extent blastomeres of early mouse cleavage-stage embryos are pre-determined towards their future fate has been a matter of some debate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>. It is now well accepted that position, cell polarization and relative threshold levels of a few interacting transcription factors bias a blastomere&#x02019;s fate towards the embryonic or extraembryonic cell lineage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>. Irreversible fixation of cell fate only occurs at the late blastocyst stage, however, and our findings provide, for the first time, a molecular mechanism for this transition from initial plasticity to lineage-restricted potency in development. This regulative view of development was most famously expressed by C. H. Waddington, who likened the path of a cell lineage towards terminal differentiation to a ball travelling downwards along branching valleys; once it has entered its final valley it cannot easily cross the mountain into the neighbouring one or return to the beginning. This creates canalization of developmental pathways so that they become stable and potentially irreversible<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>. Our observations give rise to a molecular model of regulation and canalization in early mammalian development. Manipulation of gatekeeper genes such as <italic>Elf5</italic> or their epigenetic regulation may help with strategies in regenerative medicine that aim to generate appropriate cell types by transdifferentiation or by reprogramming of somatic cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Animals and tissue preparation</title><p id="P22">Mice heterozugous for the <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>c</sup> allele<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> were maintained on a C57BL/6 background.

Wildtype ES cells were transfected with an <italic>Elf5</italic>-GFP expression construct, FACS sorted and assessed by qRT-PCR. The construct confers high levels of <italic>Elf5</italic> expression to transfected cells (Elf5) compared to control transfected cells (vec) that do not express <italic>Elf5</italic>. Elf5 induces high expression of <italic>Eomes. Cdx2</italic> expression is significantly elevated after 1 and 2 days (&#x0003e;3-fold), and reaches highest activation levels after 3 days of <italic>Elf5</italic> transfection (data are mean &#x000b1; s.d., *<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, **<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.005; n=3). <bold>(f)</bold>&#x0200b; <italic>Elf5, Cdx2</italic>, or empty vector control, were co-transfected with 2 kb <italic>Cdx2, Eomes</italic> or <italic>Elf5</italic> promoter-reporter constructs. Expression of the reporter gene was analyzed by qRT-PCR 24 hours after transfection. Elf5 can induce both <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic> promoters.

ES cells heterozygous for a gene-trap insertion at the <italic>Elf5</italic> locus grown for 5 days in TS medium with 5-azacytidine and assessed for <italic>Elf5, Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic> expression. The gene-trap insertion reduces <italic>Elf5</italic> mRNA levels to 44% and further reduces protein levels. Elf5 and Cdx2 staining is abundant in wild-type ES cells (arrowheads); almost no Elf5 immunostaining is detected in <italic>Elf5</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells. Low Elf5 expression is associated with a dramatic decrease in Cdx2 protein and <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic> mRNA levels.

Developmental onset of expression and genetic data place <italic>Elf5</italic> downstream of <italic>Cdx2, Eomes</italic> and <italic>Fgfr2</italic>. The developmental position of <italic>Elf5</italic> coincides with the definitive fixation of cell lineage fate at the late blastocyst stage. <italic>Elf5</italic> is regulated by DNA methylation, but the upstream players <italic>Cdx2, Eomes</italic> and <italic>Fgfr2</italic> are not. <italic>Elf5</italic> creates an essential feedback loop to reinforce <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Eomes</italic> expression in trophoblast stem cells. Epigenetic silencing of <italic>Elf5</italic> by DNA methylation interrupts this trophoblast-specific reinforcement loop in the embryonic lineage, and thereby safeguards embryonic cells from differentiating into trophoblast derivatives.
