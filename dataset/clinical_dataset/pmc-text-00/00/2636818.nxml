It belongs to helicase superfamily 2, and shares homology with the human DNA polymerase &#x00398; (Pol&#x00398;), HEL308, and <italic>Drosophila </italic>Mus308 proteins, which are involved in DNA repair. Previous biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm preferentially binds to fork-related Y-structured DNAs and unwinds their double-stranded regions, suggesting that this helicase is a functional counterpart of the bacterial RecQ helicase, which is essential for genome maintenance. Elucidation of the DNA unwinding and translocation mechanisms by <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm will require its three-dimensional structure at atomic resolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We determined the crystal structures of <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm, in two apo-states and two nucleotide bound forms, at resolutions of 2.0&#x02013;2.7 &#x000c5;. The overall structures and the local conformations around the nucleotide binding sites are almost the same, including the side-chain conformations, irrespective of the nucleotide-binding states. The architecture of Hjm was similar to that of <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus </italic>Hel308 complexed with DNA. An Hjm-DNA complex model, constructed by fitting the five domains of Hjm onto the corresponding Hel308 domains, indicated that the interaction of Hjm with DNA is similar to that of Hel308. Notably, sulphate ions bound to Hjm lie on the putative DNA binding surfaces. Electron microscopic analysis of an Hjm-DNA complex revealed substantial flexibility of the double stranded region of DNA, presumably due to particularly weak protein-DNA interactions. Our present structures allowed reasonable homology model building of the helicase region of human Pol&#x00398;, indicating the strong conformational conservation between archaea and eukarya.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The detailed comparison between our DNA-free <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm structure and the structure of Hel308 complexed with DNA suggests similar DNA unwinding and translocation mechanisms, which could be generalized to all of the members in the same family. Structural comparison also implied a minor rearrangement of the five domains during DNA unwinding reaction. The unexpected small contact between the DNA duplex region and the enzyme appears to be advantageous for processive helicase activity.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>DNA helicases are enzymes that translocate along DNA and unwind double-stranded regions in an ATP-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. They play crucial and universal roles in DNA metabolism, such as DNA replication and recombinational repair. As a consequence of their physiologically important functions, many reports have been published regarding protein characterization and catalytic mechanisms, including the relationships between enzymatic dysfunctions and several human genetic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Our on-going structural analysis of the late stage of homologous recombination, such as the RuvABC-Holliday junction (HJ) complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], tempted us to investigate the molecular machinery involved in Holliday junction processing in eukaryotes. We also noticed that the archaeal proteins involved in DNA metabolism generally have amino acid sequences and three-dimensional (3D) structures that are highly similar to their eukaryotic homolog. The proteins from the hyperthermophilic archaea, including <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic>, are more advantageous for structural studies than their eukaryotic counterparts, because of their remarkable thermal stability. In fact, we were the first group to successfully identify the Holliday junction resolvase from archaea, which we designated as Hjc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and we also determined its crystal structure by X-ray analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A subsequent screening study for a new protein factor that stimulates the HJ resolving activity by Hjc led to the identification of a new protein factor, termed Hef [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Biochemical and sequence analyses revealed that this protein should be classified as an XPF/Rad1/Mus81 nuclease, which bears endonuclease activity specific for flap or fork structures. Interestingly, the full-length Hef molecule contains a Super family 2 (SF2) helicase at the amino terminus. We determined the crystal structures of each region that individually folds into a distinct, rigid architecture, such as the helicase region, the nuclease domain, and the C-terminal domain containing the two repeated HhH motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The combined approach of structural and functional analyses of the nuclease regions also revealed the bipartite substrate recognition mode, which is quite likely to be conserved in the XPF/Rad1/Mus81 nuclease family. Intriguingly, the human Hef ortholog was found to be an important component of the FANC core complex, which plays a crucial role in the Fanconi Anemia-related DNA repair process responding to cross-link damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In parallel with these studies, we initiated experiments to identify the branch migration activity of the Holliday junction in archaea. In <italic>P. furiosus</italic>, we successfully indentified a novel DNA helicase, which we designated as Hjm (pf0677), according to its functional activity, <underline>H</underline>olliday <underline>j</underline>unction <underline>m</underline>igration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Its primary structure of 720 amino acids indicated that the Hjm helicase belongs to SF2, and was intriguingly found to share significant similarity to the helicase-like regions of the human DNA polymerase &#x00398; (Pol&#x00398;), HEL308, and Drosophila Mus308 proteins, which are all involved in DNA repair. Hjm appears to be unique to archaea, because of the lack of sequence similarity to proteins from bacteria and yeast. However, it was recently found that this structure-specific helicase preferentially binds to fork-related Y-structured DNAs and unwinds their double-stranded regions. Additionally, Hjm partially complements the RecQ function in <italic>E. coli dnaE486recQ </italic>mutant cells <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Similar results were also reported for another archaeal homologous helicase from <italic>Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These results suggest that Hjm may be a functional counterpart of the RecQ helicases in archaea. The functional interaction of Hjm with PCNA also revealed that this helicase could participate in a reconstituted replisome to restart a stalled replication fork [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Most recently, the crystal structure of the archaeal homolog of Hel308, from <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic>, was determined in both the DNA-free and DNA-complexed states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Another structure of Hel308 from <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus </italic>was also reported, and a unique role for the small C-terminal domain to regulate its unwinding activity was proposed in combination with biochemical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Despite these intriguing findings, many aspects of the Hjm helicase, such as its actual substrates <italic>in vivo </italic>and its ATP-dependent unwinding mechanism of DNA duplexes, still remain elusive.</p><p>In order to obtain more detailed and clearer insights into the 3D structure and the helicase action at the atomic level, we determined the crystal structure of <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm, in two apo-states at 2.0 and 2.4 &#x000c5; resolution, in the ADP-bound form at 2.4 &#x000c5;, and in the ATP-analog bound form at 2.7 &#x000c5;. In combination with single particle electron microscopy of the enzyme complexed with a putative synthetic DNA substrate, the atomic structure revealed clearer views of the functional and structural aspects of each domain, such as DNA substrate recognition and nucleotide binding, in comparison with the structural data of the previously reported Hel308 helicases.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Overview of the structure</title><p>We obtained the two different <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm crystals (Forms 1 and 2) in the nucleotide free-state, and determined their structures at 2.4 &#x000c5; (Form 1) and 2.0 &#x000c5; (Form 2) resolutions, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In the Form 1 crystal, the C-terminal 60 residues, about two thirds of the C-terminal domain, are missing in the final model, presumably because of structural disorder. On the other hand, in the Form 2, we could build the model of almost the entire molecule except for the C-terminal twenty residues. Although we could not obtain cocrystals with nucleotides, we soaked ATP analogs into the crystals, and successfully determined the nucleotide complex structures. The structures of the two apo-forms are quite similar, with a root-mean square deviation (rmsd) of 1.05 &#x000c5; for the corresponding 651 C<sub>&#x003b1; </sub>atoms. Nucleotide binding to the protein also causes no large structural change; The overall rmsd value between the apo- and ATP&#x003b3;S-soakd states is 0.30 &#x000c5; in Form 1, and similarly that between the apo- and AMPPCP-bound structures is 0.40 &#x000c5; in Form 2.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Data collection, phasing, and refinement</p></caption><table

1 to 5) with dimensions of approximately 70 &#x000d7; 50 &#x000d7; 30 &#x000c5;. The protein possesses a concave surface on the front-view side and a hole (about 10 &#x000c5; diameter) at the center of the molecule (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). The two N-terminal domains 1 (residues 1&#x02013;197) and 2 (residues 198&#x02013;399) form typical helicase domains with a cleft between them, as commonly observed in the helicase superfamily. The seven conserved helicase sequence motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] line the cleft walls in an arrangement similar to that observed in other helicase structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Domain 1 contains the Walker A and B motifs that are widely conserved in nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases. The Form 1 ATP&#x003b3;S-soaked crystal exhibited electron density corresponding to the hydrolyzed product ADP, rather than the soaked ATP&#x003b3;S, in the nucleotide-binding pocket (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>).

The triphosphate is wrapped up by the Walker A motif (Thr48 to Thr53), which contains the invariant lysine residue (Lys52). The &#x003b3;-phosphate faces the two acidic residues in the Walker B motif (Asp145 and Glu146). Interestingly, in the Hjm structures, the conformations around the nucleotide binding sites are almost the same, including the side-chain conformations, independently of the nucleotide-binding states. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref> shows a close-up view around the nucleotide binding sites of the three family members. A comparison of the nucleotide binding pocket of Hjm with those in the two Hel308 helicases revealed that the pocket of <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308 is partly disrupted: In the superimposed structure, the three amino acids of the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308 sterically clash with the ATP-analog molecule bound to Hjm (Ile26 with the adenine moiety, and Ala50 and Ala51 with the &#x003b2;-phosphate), indicating that the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308 segments should undergo a structural change upon nucleotide binding. On the other hand, the <italic>S. solfataricus </italic>enzyme exhibits a highly similar structure around the nucleotide binding site, and therefore seems to be ready to bind the nucleotide.</p><p>The C-terminal region is divided into three domains (domains 3&#x02013;5). Domain 3 (residues 400&#x02013;492) has a structural segment similar to the winged-helix (WH) motif. This motif is often used for the recognition and binding of double-stranded DNA (ds DNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the case of Hjm, however, it is unclear whether this segment is important for DNA binding, because the electrostatic potential surface has few notably positive areas in this region. Consistently, in the structure of the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308-DNA complex, the corresponding segment was not involved in DNA binding. Domain 4 (residues 492&#x02013;642) folds into a seven &#x003b1;-helix bundle structure. This fold seems to be unique within this helicase family, as thus far.</p><p>The C-terminal domain 5 (residues 643&#x02013;720) is the smallest and contains the HhH motif. The HhH motif is present in many DNA metabolizing proteins that recognize ssDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Indeed, the corresponding element in the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308 helicase interacts with DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the case of the <italic>S. solfataricus </italic>and <italic>M. thermautotrophicus </italic>Hel308, this domain exhibited a regulatory function to tune the processivity of its helicase activity as a molecular brake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm possesses a PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) box at the C-terminus, which is required for the physical interaction with PCNA, and the unwinding activity of <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm for the fork-structured DNA is enhanced by PCNA <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, the C-terminal segment was invisible in both the Form 1 and Form 2 crystals, suggesting that this segment is highly mobile.</p></sec><sec><title>The Interaction of <italic>PfuHjm </italic>with DNA is similar to that of the archaeal Hel308 helicase</title><p>Based on the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308-DNA crystal structure, a DNA unwinding mechanism has been proposed for this helicase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In this mechanism, the central helix of domain 4 acts as the "ratchet" formed by two key amino acid residues (Arg592 and Trp599 of <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308). These residues form stacking interactions on base moieties of the DNA, thus pushing out 3' tails of unwound DNAs from the tunnel, formed by the domains 1, 3, and 4, toward an exit near domain 5. An interesting feature is that the ratchet helix is located near the conserved helicase motifs, Ia and Ib of domain 1, and IV of domain 2, which are associated with ATPase activity.</p><p><italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm shares 30% and 37% amino acid identity with the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>and <italic>S. solfataricus </italic>Hel308 helicases, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Multiple sequence alignment), and the overall folding of <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm is very similar to those of those proteins throughout the molecule. <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm was fitted to the protein of the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308-DNA complex, with an rmsd of 2.06 &#x000c5;, for the corresponding 561 C<sub>a </sub>atoms, while rmsd values for individual fitting of each domain is 1.04, 0.99, 0.90, 1.13, and 1.22 &#x000c5;, for domains 1 to 5, respectively. This indicates that the spatial arrangements of the five domains significantly differ between <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm and the DNA-bound <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308, and hence each domain of <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm was separately fitted to the corresponding domain of <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308.</p><p>First, we superimposed <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm on <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308 only using domain 2, which recognizes the branch points of the substrate DNA, and then the other four domains were further moved separately to the best fitted positions. The shifts of the second fitting could correspond to the movements of each domain upon DNA binding. The second shifts, defined as the center of mass, were 0.91, 0.77, 1.01, and 1.03 &#x000c5; for domains 1, 3, 4, and 5, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Therefore, as suggested previously for <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the domain rearrangement of <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm should be small upon branched DNA processing. According to the scheme of the helicase-DNA recognition revealed from the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308-DNA complex crystal structure, we visually inspected which amino acids interact with DNA in the fitted <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm-DNA binding model, and found out that such amino acids and their locations are substantially conserved (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Multiple sequence alignment).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Structural comparison of <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm with the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308-DNA complex</bold>.

However, the residues that contact the DNA in the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308-DNA complex are substantially conserved in the sequence, and thus the protein-DNA interactions at this &#x003b2;-hairpin loop could be quite similar between the two enzymes. In the <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm crystal structures, several segments exhibit high temperature factors, and the side chain atoms could not be assigned in the electron density maps. Among these, segments 332&#x02013;335 and 347&#x02013;351 are located on the possible DNA interacting surfaces. We presume that their conformational flexibility would be important for the continuous DNA translocating and unwinding reaction, which is coupled with ATP binding/hydrolysis.</p><p>The Form1 crystals were obtained using ammonium sulfate as a precipitant, and it was found that five sulfate ions were bound to the protein. Notably, all of the sulfate ions lie on possible DNA binding surfaces (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Similarly, it was reported that phosphate ions are bound in the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>and <italic>S. solfataricus </italic>Hel308 structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Collectively, these results indicate that the sulfate/phosphate ions mimic DNA backbone phosphates. For instance, a sulfate ion is strongly bound to Arg306 and Arg309 in domain 2 of <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm. Two point mutations (R306A or R309A) in <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm significantly decreased the DNA binding ability (Fujikane and Ishino, unpublished data).</p><p>Taken together, the <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm structures strongly suggest that this helicase recognize branched DNAs in a similar manner to that in the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308-DNA complex. Therefore, it is also likely that the DNA unwinding mechanism is conserved between them.</p></sec><sec><title>Electron microscopy of <italic>PfuHjm </italic>complexed with DNA</title><p>We were not successful in obtaining <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm DNA complex crystals. Therefore, we used single particle electron microscopy to analyze the structure of a <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm in complex with a 3' overhang DNA, and indeed, a 3D image was obtained at 23&#x000c5; resolution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The complex has a main body with a protruded portion. The main body corresponds to <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm, as the atomic structure of <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm fits well into the electron density isosurface. Consequently, the protruded portion should correspond to the ds DNA lying outside of the protein molecule. It should be noted that the orientation of the ds DNA is different between the <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm-DNA EM structure and the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>Hel308-DNA crystal structure. The ds DNA in our complex is tilted by about 70 degrees, as compared to that in the <italic>A. fulgidus </italic>enzyme complex. The sequence and the secondary structure of DNA used in our study is slightly different from that of the Hel308 complex. However, it is unlikely that this caused the difference in DNA orientations. In fact, the double-stranded region of the DNA substrate, in both of the protein-DNA complexes, weakly interacts with the helicases through minor contacts. For instance, our previous electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated that the apparent dissociation constant of <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm against ds DNA was about 5 times higher than those against single-stranded or Y-shaped DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, the ds DNA may have happened to be fixed at the distinct positions, because crystallographic and EM analyses target different states of protein or protein-DNA complexes.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Electron microscopy of the <italic>Pfu</italic>Hjm-DNA complex</bold>.

A minimum dose system (MDS) was used to reduce the electron radiation damage of the sample. The step size of a pixel of the image was calibrated to be 5.1 &#x000c5;, using TMV as a reference sample. Image processing was performed using the software packages EMAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and IMAGIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Individual particle images were boxed out, using the GUI-based program boxer in EMAN. The class average images of the Hjm-DNA complexes were obtained by several cycles of a multireference alignment and classification procedure for image sets. The programs in IMAGIC were used to calculate these class averages. The initial 3D map was obtained by common-line method and subsequent iterative refinement was performed using REFINE routine of EMAN. The resolution of the 3D map was estimated by the 0.5 criterion of the Fourier shell correlation. The visualization of the 3D map and fitting of the crystal structure into the map were performed, using the Chimera software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Homology modeling</title><p>The homology model of the helicase-like domain of human DNA polymerase &#x00398; (UniProt code Q6VMB5) was constructed by using the Homology module of the MOE application (Ryouka Systems Inc.), which was based on the methods of Levitt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and Fechteler et al.
