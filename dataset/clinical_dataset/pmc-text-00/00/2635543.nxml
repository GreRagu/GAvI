Aside from maternal and fetal death, the                condition may also result in intra-uterine growth restriction, seizures (eclampsia),                renal or liver failure, and placental abruption. Despite much investigation, the                pathological processes underlying this disease are still largely undiscovered.                Previous investigations have focussed on defective placental implantation as an                important aetiological factor, with the resulting release of placentally derived                circulating factors, which cause endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. At the                microvascular level, there is a state of vasoconstriction from smooth muscle                contraction, increased vascular permeability and anti-angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which correspond to the clinical findings of                high BP (blood pressure), oedema and a characteristically small placenta at delivery                of the baby.</p><p>The VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) family is thought to be one of the                important molecular systems involved in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.                Conventional VEGF, also known as VEGF-A, is made up of six different isoforms formed                from alternative exon splicing, resulting in proteins of varying amino acid length,                termed VEGF<sub>xxx</sub>. VEGF<sub>165</sub> is the most common isoform of                    VEGF<sub>xxx</sub>, and consists of 165 amino acids. VEGF<sub>165</sub> acts via                its receptor VEGFR-2 to increase vascular permeability, vasodilation and                angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Endogenous alternative                splicing of the VEGFR results in soluble VEGFR-1 {also known as sFlt-1 [soluble                Flt-1 (fms-like tyrosine kinase-1)]}, which binds to VEGF and inhibits its function                    [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. High levels of sFlt-1 have been                documented in pre-eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>VEGF levels in pre-eclampsia have been measured by a number of techniques, with                conflicting results according to the technique used. When measured by commercial                sandwich ELISAs, which have been proposed to measure only the free unbound forms of                VEGF, levels appear to be reduced in pre-eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. When measured by RIA or cEIA                [competitive EIA (enzyme immunoassay)], VEGF levels have been shown to increase                substantially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This discrepancy has been                proposed to be due to these latter two methods not being affected by circulating                binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In 2002, an alternative family of VEGF-A isoforms were identified, termed                    VEGF<sub>xxx</sub>b. These are the same size as conventional VEGF-A, but are                alternatively spliced in exon 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This                alternative splice site selection results in an alternate six amino-acid C-terminus,                which affects the property of the isoforms. VEGF<sub>165</sub>b is the most widely                studied of these isoforms. VEGF<sub>165</sub>b has been shown to inhibit the effects                of VEGF<sub>165</sub> by binding to its principal receptor VEGFR-2 and preventing it                from exerting its physiological effects, such as endothelial cell proliferation and                migration. VEGF<sub>165</sub>b also binds to and activates Flt-1 (VEGFR-1),                resulting in a transient increase in capillary hydraulic conductivity, but no                sustained increase in permeability, in contrast with VEGF<sub>165</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] of VEGF<sub>165</sub>b in term placenta detected a decrease                in VEGF<sub>xxx</sub>b expression in pre-eclamptic placenta compared with control                placenta, and an uncoupling of the splicing link between VEGF<sub>165</sub>b and                    VEGF<sub>165</sub>. To determine whether VEGF<sub>165</sub>b may play a role in                the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia, we have investigated the expression of                    VEGF<sub>165</sub>b in maternal plasma from normotensive and pre-eclamptic                pregnancies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Pregnant subjects were recruited from St Michael's Maternity Hospital, Bristol,                    U.K. between June 2006 and December 2007.

A total of 50 subjects were                    recruited from routine antenatal clinics in the first trimester of pregnancy.                    Subjects were aged between 17 and 42&#x000a0;years.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure                        6</xref> (left-hand panel), VEGF<sub>165</sub>b levels have an AUC                    significantly greater than 0.5 in contrast with sFlt-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, middle panel) and sEng (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, right-hand panel).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>ROC curves for first trimester VEGF<sub>165</sub>b, sFlt-1 and sEng                            in the prediction of pre-eclampsia</title><p>AUC was highest for VEGF<sub>165</sub>b [<italic>P</italic>=0.0047                            compared with random (0.5)].

In the present                study, the total VEGF levels measured by EIA are consistent with those measured                previously using this assay methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]                and by those using an independent method, the RIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In contrast, the ELISA results in the present study from the same                samples gave much lower readings, consistent with previous ELISA reports of plasma                VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These experiments therefore                highlight the discrepancy reported previously between measurements of total                circulating VEGF in plasma by commercial ELISAs compared with cEIA or RIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The antibodies used in the ELISA are two                monoclonals raised against the VEGF peptide sequence and thus may be raised against                a similar or identical epitope. The ELISA appears to yield artificially low results,                presumably as VEGF is bound by agents in plasma which prevent its detection by both                antibodies simultaneously. sFlt-1 does not affect this ELISA when given as a                recombinant protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], but the effect of                endoglin or other plasma constituents have not been tested. The discrepancy was                particularly striking after measurement of VEGF<sub>165</sub>b levels, using an                ELISA that detects plasma VEGF<sub>165</sub>b using two antibodies that have                epitopes on completely separate parts of the antigen (VEGF) molecule. It is                therefore rather disturbing that the cEIA is no longer commercially available and                was withdrawn from sale by all known suppliers between 2006 and 2007.</p><p>Of the VEGF family, VEGF<sub>165</sub>, the most widely studied form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], is known to increase vascular leakage,                induce vasodilation and promote angiogenesis. Although this isoform is up-regulated                in pre-eclampsia, its metabolic activities may be blocked by other proteins which                bind to VEGF and inhibit its function. sFlt-1 and sEng both bind to VEGF and prevent                it from exerting its physiological effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. sFlt-1 is an anti-angiogenic molecule that is able to induce a                pre-eclamptic-like syndrome of hypertension and proteinuria when administered to                pregnant rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. sEng is an anti-angiogenic                protein that inhibits TGF (transforming growth factor) &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and                    &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> signalling and increases the severity of pre-eclampsia                occurring in pregnant rats treated with sFlt-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, neither molecule can be used clinically as a first trimester                marker of pre-eclampsia as sFlt-1 levels are observed to increase only                5&#x000a0;weeks before the onset of the clinical disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and sEng concentrations become elevated at                17&#x000a0;weeks of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In 2002, VEGF<sub>165</sub>b was identified in normal renal cortex and was                subsequently shown to be present in many different tissues, and forms the majority                of VEGF in tissues such as human colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]                and vitreous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. VEGF<sub>165</sub>b is                relatively down-regulated in many conditions, including prostate, renal, bowel and                skin cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>],                diabetic retinopathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>],                Denys&#x02013;Drash Syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and in                the placenta of patients with pre-eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying these changes in expression are still under                investigation, but the reduction is associated with excess angiogenesis.                    VEGF<sub>165</sub>b has been shown to be anti-angiogenic in animal models of                    VEGF<sub>165</sub>-induced blood vessel growth in the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], mouse subcutaneous tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and rat mesentery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and inhibits physiological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and pathological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] angiogenesis. Studies have also shown that                VEGF<sub>165</sub>b transiently, but not chronically, increases hydraulic                conductivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The results shown in the present study indicate that VEGF<sub>165</sub>b fails to be                up-regulated in the first trimester in those pregnancies that will later be                complicated by pre-eclampsia. It can be concluded that VEGF<sub>165</sub>b may be a                clinically useful first trimester marker for increased pre-eclampsia risk, providing                for instance a guide to commencement of first trimester oral aspirin therapy, as                this decreases the incidence of pre-eclampsia by 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>It is not clear what mediates the up-regulation of VEGF<sub>165</sub>b in early                pregnancy or what prevents it in women who will develop pre-eclampsia, and further                work must be done to investigate this finding. The failure of up-regulation may be                reflective of the aetiology or could be contributory to the subsequent                pre-eclampsia. For instance, in the first trimester, the reduced anti-angiogenic                    VEGF<sub>165</sub>b compared with normal pregnancy may reflect a maternal                vasculature response to try and correct the defective implantation processes                underlying the disease, or the failure to up-regulate VEGF<sub>165</sub>b may                contribute to defective implantation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the women who donated their time and their plasma to this                study.</p></ack><sec sec-type="funding"><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by the <funding-source id="gs1">British Heart                Foundation</funding-source> [grant numbers <award-id rid="gs1">FS/05/100,                BS06/005</award-id>]; and the <funding-source id="gs2">Wellcome                Trust</funding-source> [grant number <award-id rid="gs2">74702</award-id>].</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Khan</surname><given-names>K.&#x000a0;S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wojdyla</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Say</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>G&#x000fc;lmezoglu</surname><given-names>A.&#x000a0;M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Van&#x000a0;Look</surname><given-names>P.&#x000a0;F.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>WHO analysis of causes of maternal death: a systematic review</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2006</year><volume>367</volume><fpage>1066</fpage><lpage>1074</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16581405</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Damsky</surname><given-names>C.&#x000a0;H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>S.&#x000a0;J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Preeclampsia is associated with failure of human cytotrophoblasts                        to mimic a vascular adhesion phenotype.
