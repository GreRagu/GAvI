However, whether this requirement is fulfilled is seldom tested explicitly. Here we provide a lab/field comparison to investigate the identity of an egg-marking signal of ant queens. Our study was based on ant workers resolving conflict over male production by destroying each other's eggs, but leaving queen eggs unharmed. For this, the workers need a proximate cue to discriminate between the two egg types. Earlier correlative evidence indicated that, in the ant <italic>Pachycondyla inversa</italic>, the hydrocarbon 3,11-dimethylheptacosane (3,11-diMeC<sub>27</sub>) is more abundant on the surface of queen-laid eggs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p>We first tested the hypothesis that 3,11-diMeC<sub>27</sub> functions as a queen egg-marking pheromone using laboratory-maintained colonies. We treated worker-laid eggs with synthetic 3,11-diMeC<sub>27</sub> and found that they were significantly more accepted than sham-treated worker-laid eggs. However, we repeated the experiment with freshly collected field colonies and observed no effect of treating worker-laid eggs with 3,11-diMeC<sub>27</sub>, showing that this compound by itself is not the natural queen egg-marking pheromone. We subsequently investigated the overall differences of entire chemical profiles of eggs, and found that queen-laid eggs in field colonies are more distinct from worker-laid eggs than in lab colonies, have more variation in profiles, and have an excess of longer-chain hydrocarbons.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results suggest that queen egg-marking signals are significantly affected by transfer to the laboratory, and that this change is possibly connected to reduced queen fertility as predicted by honest signaling theory.

However, if the acceptance rate of discriminating workers also depended on other egg compounds, or even on the entire chemical profile of eggs, this might provide an explanation for the observed difference, provided that there would be systematic differences in chemical profiles of eggs between field and lab colonies. The hydrocarbon profiles of both QLE and WLE consist of linear and methyl-branched alkanes, the majority of which could be identified &#x0005b;29 compounds; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004718-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004718-dEttorre2">&#x0005b;ref. 17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x0005d;. Additional samples of eggs, relative to those used in bio-assays, showed that in lab colonies treatment increased the average (&#x000b1;SD) percentage of 3,11-diMeC<sub>27</sub> in the entire hydrocarbon profile from 9.0&#x00025; (&#x000b1;2.7&#x00025;) on WLE (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12) to 26.1&#x00025; (&#x000b1;0.6&#x00025;) on TWLE (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2), as compared to 12.0&#x00025; (&#x000b1;3.2&#x00025;) on QLE (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;17). Similarly, in field colonies the relative abundance increased from 6.4&#x00025; (&#x000b1;2.3&#x00025;) on WLE (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14) to 23.5&#x00025; (&#x000b1;8.2&#x00025;) on TWLE (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14), compared to 12.9&#x00025; (&#x000b1;7.8&#x00025;) on QLE (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;15) (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004718.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Hence, QLE and WLE had similar relative proportions of 3,11-diMeC<sub>27</sub> under lab and field conditions, and treatment with synthetic 3,11-diMeC<sub>27</sub> had a clear and comparable effect on the relative abundance of this compound in the profile. We used log-transformed peak areas in Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and when plotting the first two PC's for QLE and WLE of lab colonies, we found considerable overlap between the two egg types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004718-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) with the predicted positions of TWLE falling within the QLE group. Hence, the major difference between QLE and WLE in lab colonies is indeed the relative abundance of 3,11-diMeC<sub>27</sub>, so that the experimental addition of this compound to WLE turns them into mimics of QLE. In the field colonies, however, there was a much clearer distinction between QLE and WLE to start with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004718-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), and the PCA positions of TWLE did not come to overlap with those of QLE. This implies that, although treatment with 3,11-diMeC<sub>27</sub> worked both under field and laboratory conditions, the effect in field colonies was not sufficient to let TWLE mimic QLE, but the same chemical compound made TWLE as acceptable as QLE in lab colonies.</p><p>Apart from more variation and better separation between QLE and WLE in field colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004718-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), the profiles of QLE in field colonies were characterized by higher abundance of longer-chain hydrocarbons (3-MeC<sub>27</sub>, C<sub>28</sub>, 3,11-diMeC<sub>27</sub>, C<sub>29</sub>, and especially 3-MeC<sub>29</sub>), which was only observed to some extent on QLE in lab colonies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004718-Heinze1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004718-dEttorre2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004718.s003">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004718.s002">Figure S2</xref>.

Artificial selection experiments typically overestimate the heritability of traits relative to natural populations, and a central problem is therefore how these differences can be matched <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004718-Kruuk1">&#x0005b;e.g. 21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004718-Postma1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004718-Zhou1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Deceptive laboratory results have been obtained in studies of chemical recognition in vertebrates. Individual recognition in genetically uniform laboratory strains of the house mouse, <italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic>, has traditionally been assumed to depend on scents derived from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).

Examples like these emphasize that great care should be taken when performing bioassays and interpreting results under laboratory conditions, as they are not always representative for the more complex field conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Possible fertility reduction under laboratory conditions</title><p>The pattern we observed in our experiments may also be due to another feature of our laboratory conditions, namely a possible reduction in fertility of queens. Fertility signaling is of major importance in social insects, as workers sacrifice their own reproduction for inclusive fitness benefits via the reproduction of their fertile queen. The queen signal has been hypothesized to reflect fertility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004718-Ratnieks4">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004718-Keller1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, and is thus expected to vary according to the reproductive state of the queen. In the laboratory, we tried to reproduce the natural conditions of <italic>P. inversa</italic> in terms of temperature, humidity and photoperiod, but conditions may well have remained sub-optimal, because colony productivity never approached the natural situation (e.g. lab colonies produced an average&#x000b1;SD of 3.0&#x000b1;4.7 new workers in the 35 day study period, whereas field colonies produced 16.6&#x000b1;5.4 new workers). The move to the lab may thus have reduced queen fecundity, which could also have induced the higher acceptance of sham-treated WLE in lab colonies relative to field conditions (40.0&#x00025; vs. 7.5&#x00025;, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004718-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In field colonies, we assume that queens were highly fecund, and we observed that they produced eggs that were chemically very different from WLE, so that the workers could easily recognize and destroy WLE in field colonies. However, if fecundity dropped under laboratory conditions, the queen signal may have decreased so that her eggs became chemically more worker-like (although the difference in 3,11-diMeC<sub>27</sub> remained) and workers failed more easily to discriminate between WLE and QLE (and an increase 3,11-diMeC<sub>27</sub> may have tipped the balance towards acceptance). Alternatively, the workers could have lowered their threshold for WLE acceptance after detecting the decrease in queen fecundity, indicating that she was failing or ageing. In any case, this would imply that workers police eggs by relative comparison to known eggs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004718-Helanter1">&#x0005b;see also ref. 32&#x0005d;</xref>, which allows them to react in a condition-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>The hypothesis of queen signal encoded in the average chain length of cuticular profiles</title><p>Strong differences in multiple hydrocarbons between fertile and unfertile individuals have been found in several social insect species.

These varying results imply that considerable further work is needed to establish whether these caste-correlated differences would decrease when queen fecundity is compromised.</p><p>Although these studies mainly obtained correlative results, they suggest that these putative fertility signals are making use of the production of alkenes and shifts in the average hydrocarbon chain length, which should therefore be more costly to produce/maintain than alkanes of median chain length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004718-Zahavi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. To concentrate on the chain length, as may be the case for <italic>P. inversa</italic>, this hypothesis predicts that cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of unfertile workers of social insects should be bell-shaped, with abundant peaks in the centre (e.g. 27 carbon atoms in the case of <italic>P. inversa</italic>) and minor peaks at both ends.
