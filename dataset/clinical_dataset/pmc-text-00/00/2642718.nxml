During infection, <italic>E. coli</italic> O157&#x02236;H7 secretes StcE, a metalloprotease that promotes the formation of attaching and effacing lesions and inhibits the complement cascade via cleavage of mucin-type glycoproteins. We found that StcE cleaved the mucin-like, immune cell-restricted glycoproteins CD43 and CD45 on the neutrophil surface and altered neutrophil function. Treatment of human neutrophils with StcE led to increased respiratory burst production and increased cell adhesion. StcE-treated neutrophils exhibited an elongated morphology with defective rear detachment and impaired migration, suggesting that removal of the anti-adhesive capability of CD43 by StcE impairs rear release. Use of zebrafish embryos to model neutrophil migration revealed that StcE induced neutrophil retention in the fin after tissue wounding, suggesting that StcE modulates neutrophil-mediated inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Neutrophils are crucial innate effectors of the antibacterial immune response and can contribute to severe complications caused by infection with <italic>E. coli</italic> O157&#x02236;H7.

Research suggests that EHEC strains are growing more virulent, resulting in a higher incidence of hospitalization and development of HUS from recent produce-associated outbreaks. Although immune dysregulation is a feature of HUS disease, the specific mechanisms contributing to altered immune function require investigation. Furthermore, the contribution of the immune response to early intestinal disease is not known. StcE is a secreted protease of EHEC that is expressed during infection and may contribute to virulence via cleavage of mucin-like glycoproteins. In this study, we define mucinase activity toward glycoproteins on the surface of human neutrophils and find that StcE alters neutrophil activity by interacting with these proteins. StcE affected crucial neutrophil functions including oxidative burst production and migration. The effects of StcE were both cleavage-dependent and cleavage-independent, providing insight into a novel mechanism for mediating neutrophil function via mucin interactions. Our study reports an immune-modulating role for a potential EHEC virulence factor and provides a possible explanation for altered neutrophil phenotypes observed during <italic>E. coli</italic> O157&#x02236;H7-induced disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enterohemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EHEC) of serogroup O157&#x02236;H7 is an emerging human diarrheal pathogen associated with numerous food-borne outbreaks in the U.S. Infection of the colon by EHEC causes mild diarrhea that proceeds to bloody colitis and can be acquired following ingestion of fewer than 100 organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Cleary1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

StcE altered neutrophil function via both cleavage-dependent and cleavage-independent effects. Proteolytic activity of StcE led to increased neutrophil oxidative burst production, while binding of StcE was sufficient to increase neutrophil adhesion, leading to impaired migratory capacity. We propose that the interaction between StcE and CD43 prevents the sialoglycoprotein from providing crucial anti-adhesive force, preventing uropod-mediated detachment leading to impaired migration. Oxidative burst production and migration defects leading to increased neutrophil retention could contribute to tissue destruction and inflammation, as well as bacterial evasion of the immune response. Interaction with neutrophil surface mucins by StcE might therefore represent a novel way of dysregulating the immune response during EHEC disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>StcE Binds the Neutrophil Surface Glycoproteins CD43 and CD45</title><p>StcE binds to and aggregates cells of the Jurkat leukemic T cell line and binds to the undifferentiated HL-60 promyelocytic cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Lathem1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Heat-inactived StcE (hiStcE) had no effect on neutrophil adhesion. E435D is proteolytically inactive but retains substrate binding activity, unlike hiStcE, indicating that binding is the minimal function necessary to induce neutrophil adhesion. To account for the possibility that StcE and E435D increased adhesion by serving as a bridge between CD43 or CD45 and the extracellular matrix, binding of StcE to Fbg was tested by ELISA.

Although they traveled shorter distances over time, StcE- and E435D-treated neutrophils did not appear deficient in production of forward protrusions. However, cells seemed unable to retract their rearward edge and move forward, suggesting that StcE interfered with neutrophil migration by preventing de-adhesion of the uropod. During migration, StcE-treated neutrophils displayed striking morphological differences, with formation of elongated tails at the uropod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000320-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). E435D treatment also resulted in elongated morphology, but the phenotype was not as severe.

CD43 and CD45 share characteristics of these substrates and were the major StcE ligands on the neutrophil surface. We found that StcE cleaved specifically within the O-glycosylated domains of these proteins. The majority of the CD43 extracellular domain is heavily O-glycosylated, and the resultant negative charge and steric hindrance serve to inhibit non-specific cell-cell interactions. StcE degraded this domain, leading to loss of anti-adhesive function. In contrast, the majority of the CD45 extracellular domain is N-glycosylated, and the N-terminal portion, which varies in length by differential splicing, is O-glycosylated. StcE cleaved within this terminal portion, leaving the majority of the protein intact. It is not known what effect the terminal O-glycosylated region has on function of the intracellular phosphatase domain, but cleavage of this region by StcE could promote inhibitory dimerization.</p><p>In order to fight infection, neutrophils must leave the bloodstream to reach effector sites.

Treatment with StcE led to increased neutrophil adhesion that interfered with random migration as well as chemotaxis across filters and endothelial monolayers. Surprisingly, this effect was cleavage-independent. The proteolytically inactive mutant, E435D, caused similar effects to StcE, suggesting that binding was the minimal function required. Our data suggest that removal of CD43 anti-adhesion is the mechanism by which StcE and E435D interfere with migration, although we cannot rule out a role for CD45. StcE degraded the extracellular domain of CD43, while E435D clustered CD43 at the uropod and blocked antibody binding to the extracellular domain. Cleavage of CD43 by StcE reduces anti-adhesive force at the promigratory leading edge, but also relieves the anti-adhesive force in the uropod that could promote rear detachment. E435D, like crosslinking antibodies, induces CD43 relocalization to the uropod, reducing anti-adhesive force at the leading edge. Binding of E435D may also mask the negative charge of CD43 and interfere with anti-adhesion at the rear, causing a similar outcome to StcE via a slightly different mechanism. Increased adhesion can be induced by crosslinking antibodies to CD43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Seveau1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, and it is unclear if this results from simple masking of the protein or because antibody binding transduces a pro-adhesive signal. Our results support the hypothesis that the anti-adhesive function of CD43 at the uropod is an important component of cellular migration.</p><p>Although it has been proposed that CD45 may regulate chemotactic signaling in neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Harvath1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, only recently has it been suggested that CD45 may be directly important for cell adhesion. Shivtiel and colleagues found that bone marrow mononuclear cells deficient in CD45 were more adherent to fibronectin as a result of increased activation of &#x003b2;1 integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Shivtiel1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that CD45 signaling may be important for neutrophil adhesion and that interaction with CD45 contributes to StcE-mediated effects on adhesion and migration. It is unknown whether StcE cleavage of the terminal O-glycosylated portion of CD45 will affect its signaling capacity. Investigation of the effect of StcE on CD45 signaling is a potential topic for future study.</p><p>The observation of a cleavage-independent function for StcE in neutrophils parallels findings with C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), another StcE substrate. StcE-cleaved C1-INH retains its ability to inhibit the complement cascade, and E435D is equally capable of potentiating C1-INH function. StcE binds to C1-INH and the bacterial surface simultaneously, increasing the local concentration of C1-INH and protecting the cell from complement-mediated lysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Lathem2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. If binding of StcE to its substrates is sufficient, what is the purpose of proteolytic activity? Proteolysis may be more important for some substrates than others. For example, cleavage of intestinal mucins might be required to promote colonization, whereas only binding is necessary to affect activity of C1-INH and CD43. Alternatively, proteolytic activity of StcE might be dispensable for its interaction with all substrates but provide enhanced turnover. StcE displays high affinity and low turnover of C1-INH and MUC7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Grys2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, and it is possible that proteolysis provides a mechanism for it to detach from one substrate molecule in order to bind another. This would facilitate interaction of the same StcE protein molecule with different substrates, allowing it to interact with multiple glycoproteins during infection.</p><p>Proteolytic activity was not completely dispensable to modulate neutrophil function, as the activities of E435D and StcE were not identical. Active StcE more potently induced an elongated cell morphology during neutrophil migration than did E435D, suggesting that cleavage was more efficient than binding in preventing rear detachment. This could be explained if binding of E435D to CD43 blocked charge repulsion, but removal of the CD43 extracellular domain by StcE eliminated both charge repulsion and steric hindrance. Furthermore, StcE exerted a cleavage-dependent effect on neutrophil oxidative burst production. The specific substrate mediating these effects was not identified, but CD45 is an attractive candidate because it has previously been reported to modulate production of the oxidative burst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Liles1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. CD43 may also play a role in oxidative burst production, although evidence for this is less clear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Nathan1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Regardless of the exact mechanism, the finding that StcE increased the oxidative burst in a cleavage-dependent manner provides further evidence that it may play an immunomodulatory role during infection.</p><p>Neutrophils are the first responders to bacterial infection, and pathogens have strategies to combat this response that include inhibition of chemoattractant receptors and inactivation of C5a and IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Nizet1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. To our knowledge, proteolysis of cell surface mucins by StcE represents a novel mechanism for altering neutrophil function. Respiratory burst production and the ability to migrate are crucial capabilities of neutrophils in fighting infection, and alteration of these functions by StcE may lead to a dysregulated immune response during EHEC infection. Neutrophils isolated from children with HUS are more adherent to the vascular endothelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Forsyth1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, and StcE could contribute to this phenotype. The effect of StcE on neutrophil migration was both rapid and persistent. Increased adhesion and impaired migration were evident after 30 minutes of StcE treatment. After 210 minutes, fewer StcE-treated neutrophils had migrated across transwell filters, suggesting this was not a transient defect that could be overcome with time. The longevity of the effect further suggests that the interaction between StcE and neutrophils may be physiologically relevant. Whether alteration of neutrophil function leads to pro- or anti-inflammatory outcomes may depend on the site of activity and presence of other stimuli. Neutrophils that remain stuck to the endothelium may be unable to migrate into the intestine in response to infection, and StcE may thus protect the bacteria from clearance by the host immune response. The observed decrease in neutrophil migration across endothelial cell monolayers supports the conclusion that StcE could impair migration out of the vasculature and into the intestine. Inhibition of complement activation at sites of infection by StcE-localized C1-INH would reduce production of the chemotactic C5a fragment, further contributing to a migration defect. Alternatively, neutrophils that are stuck to the endothelium may contribute to inflammation and tissue destruction, as seen in the kidneys during HUS. Zebrafish treated with StcE exhibited neutrophil mislocalization to the tissues that resembled recently described inflammatory mutants, lending credence to this hypothesis. The fact that mislocalization occurred at a late but not early time point after wounding may be explained by accumulation of inflammatory signals from neutrophils that are retained in the tissues, leading to progressive neutrophil infiltration and retention over time. Enhancement of the neutrophil oxidative burst by StcE could further contribute to inflammatory tissue damage in the intestines and during HUS as a result of inappropriate neutrophil retention.</p><p>The pO157 plasmid is associated with EHEC disease incidence and severity, suggesting that plasmid-encoded genes might contribute to pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Tarr1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-WelinderOlsson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

In a recently described disease model of EHEC in rabbits, mutation of the type II secretion system led to decreased colonization, and the authors conclude that lack of StcE secretion might contribute to this defective colonization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Ho1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cleavage of CD43 and CD45 by StcE on the neutrophil surface, leading to increased adhesion, defective migration, increased respiratory burst production, and overall dysregulation of the immune response, may provide another mechanism by which StcE enhances the progression of disease caused by enterohemorrhagic <italic>E. coli</italic>. Moreover, as CD43 and CD45 are expressed on many cells of the immune system, it is unlikely that the immunomodulatory activity of StcE is limited to neutrophils.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>For studies with neutrophils from human subjects, informed consent was obtained from healthy donors at the time of blood draw with approval of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Health Sciences Human Subjects committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Reagents</title><p>Recombinant StcE and E435D protein were expressed and purified as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000320-Grys1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.
