Does this cognitive mapping of social concepts arise from shared brain resources for processing social and physical relationships? Using fMRI, we found that the tasks of evaluating social compatibility and of evaluating physical distances engage a common brain substrate in the parietal cortex.

Moreover, social distances are also acted out in our natural behaviours, such as our tendency to regulate &#x0201c;personal space&#x0201d; based on the degree of social connection with others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Hall1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Hayduk1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

If the parietal cortex indeed performs analogous operations in social space, such a self-referential mapping of social distance would be an efficient manner of organizing complex social information to guide interactions with others.</p><p>In the present study, first, we investigate whether people symbolically organize social relationships on a &#x02018;distance&#x02019; scale when estimating social compatibility with other agents. In this psychophysical experiment, fifteen participants performed a doll-arrangement task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004360-g001">Figure 1</xref>). First, they had to place a doll representing self and another doll representing an incompatible person wherever they liked on a stage, and next the participants were requested to select dolls representing compatible persons based on their facial pictures and to spatially arrange on the stage wherever they liked. By measuring physical distances between a self-doll and other dolls, we may know if people represent social relationships on a &#x02018;distance&#x02019; scale when estimating social compatibility with other agents.</p><fig id="pone-0004360-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004360.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Results of a doll-arrangement task.</title><p>(A) A typical arrangement by a participant, with compatible dolls placed close to the self doll.

Twenty-four healthy volunteers performed sets of tasks. First, we prepared a physical distance (PD) task and a social distance (SD) task. In the former, a display presented two inanimate objects whose relative physical positions could be inferred by texture and lighting cues, and participants indicated which object they judged to be closer to themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004360-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In the latter, the display presented pictures of two faces, and participants indicated which individual they felt they would be more compatible with and would interact and cooperate with better in real life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004360-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The facial pictures were chosen because the facial appearance of a person is known to give us the first impression of the person and if the person is attractive to us we often feel social compatibility to that person, increasing the motivation to build a sustainable relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Zebrowitz1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Then, we expect that common section in the parietal cortex is involved in the evaluation of both physical and social distance, and degree of parietal activation reflects demands of the SD task.</p><fig id="pone-0004360-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004360.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Examples of stimuli used in the PD and SD tasks and the average results.</title><p>(A) Stimulus for PD task.

We prepared another task, i.e. a social feature (SF) task, where the participants were presented with the same pairs of faces but were asked which would be more &#x02018;socially popular&#x02019; or &#x02018;get along with people in general&#x02019;. This task replicated elements of the SD task, such as the evaluation of facial features or empathetic processing, but lacked the element of self-referential distance. Thus, it is likely that the SD task and the SF task both require common neuronal process related to the analysis of one's facial features and empathetic processing, but only the former activates the parietal cortex imposed a role of self-referential (egocentric) processing of evaluation of social distance.</p><p>Finally, we also expect that the parietal cortex communicates with other brain areas such as the fusiform gyrus, where task-relevant information about facial features is processed &#x0005b;e.g. 20, 21&#x0005d;, in a way that fusiform gyrus activity, which is most likely elicited by both the SD and SF tasks, influence the parietal activity only in the SD task.

Each participant was first asked to place a white doll (representing self) and a black doll (representing an incompatible person) wherever they liked on the stage. Next, he/she randomly picked one doll at a time out of 12 dolls (each had a facial picture of an unfamiliar person and all of the pictures were also used in the fMRI experiment), and if he/she felt that he/she would be compatible with the person in real life, he/she had to place it anywhere on the stage. Even though each participant was allowed to place the compatible dolls anywhere on the stage (Indeed, some participants simply sorted the dolls in a row fashion), the averaged distance between the self and compatible dolls across participants was significantly (physically) shorter than that between the self and incompatible dolls (paired t-test, t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4.2, df&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004360-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These suggest that people can choose compatible persons solely based on their facial appearance, and clearly demonstrate that people tend to spontaneously arrange representations of socially compatible individuals near themselves even without explicit instructions to do so. Thus, it is likely that people represent social relationships on a &#x02018;distance&#x02019; scale when estimating social compatibility with other agents.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Behavioral results in the PD and SD tasks</title><p>In order to verify the response consistency of the participants in the PD and SD tasks, all fMRI participants repeated the same PD and SD tasks outside the scanner.

As social compatibility seems to be represented on a &#x02018;distance&#x02019; scale (see above), this provided a measure of subjective social distances analogous to the objectively defined distances used in generating the PD stimuli.</p><p>We found that the reaction time (RT) became significantly longer as the differences in &#x02018;distances&#x02019; decreased, and that this relationship was consistent across both the SD and PD tasks. That is, when pairs of faces were rated as being similar in social distance, the RTs increased (F(3, 69)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12.2, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.005 inside the scanner, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 outside, single-factor ANOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004360-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The same trend was seen in the PD task: when the two physical objects were about the same distance from the participant, the RTs increased (F(2, 46)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;43.8, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 inside, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 outside; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004360-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The graded RTs in the SD task imply that when people evaluate social compatibility with a person and compare these about two persons, abstract magnitudes of their social &#x02018;distances&#x02019; could be compared, as in the case when people compare physical distances from themselves to two objects in the PD task.</p><p>Finally, the RTs for the SD task were significantly correlated inside and outside the scanner (df&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;22, <italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.69, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), indicating the consistency of the SD task demands for participants both inside and outside the scanner. Based on this finding, together with the evidence of &#x02018;distance&#x02019;-dependent processing in the SD task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004360-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), we used the subjective ratings of differences in social distance as covariates to depict brain regions related to this task demand (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Brain activation related to evaluation of &#x02018;egocentric space&#x02019;</title><p>Our main hypothesis was whether common section in the parietal cortex is involved in the evaluation of both physical and social distance. In order to depict brain areas related to both the PD and SD tasks, we prepared two control conditions (PC and SC, respectively). In these control conditions, participants simply pressed a button in response to the displayed objects or faces that are the same in the PD and SD tasks. Thus, by directly comparing brain activity during the tasks with that during their corresponding control conditions, we may depict activations purely related to the tasks that cannot be accounted by factors of simple visual and motor processing.</p><p>The fMRI analysis revealed that the only brain activity that was significantly associated with the PD task was in the superior aspects of the posterior parietal cortices.

No significant parietal activation was found in the SF task (SF vs. SC), suggesting that the common factors between SD and SF, including eye movements and attentional factors, did not contribute to the parietal activation observed only in the SD task.

Thus, our neuroimaging finding raises a possibility that the human parietal cortex is a member of social brain network.</p><p>Only superior aspect of posterior parietal cortex including intraparietal area was activated in the entire brain when the participants assessed physical distance between themselves and external objects. This is consistent with previous notion that posterior parietal cortex is involved in self-referential coding of external objects that is often used for upcoming motor behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Connolly1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Medendorp1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, a patient with lesion in the parietal lobule shows impairment in relating her body to external objects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Rapcsak1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Milner1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. All these findings indicate the importance of superior aspect of posterior parietal cortex in humans in a function of self-referential (egocentric) spatial processing of external world.</p><p>The SD task required the participants to evaluate social compatibility with a person based on his/her facial appearance. As demonstrated in the doll-arranging task, when people evaluate the social compatibility, they tend to think of the compatibility as a &#x02018;distance&#x02019; that can be converted into physical distance from the self-representing doll that brought their egocentric viewpoints. Thus, it is assumed that the participants also performed self-referential (egocentric) processing of an abstract magnitude of &#x02018;distance&#x02019; from a person in the SD task, as indicated by the graded RT in this task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004360-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Then, we found activations during the SD task in the intraparietal regions that are also active during the self-referential assessment of physical distance (PD). The activations should be related to core process of the SD task because within the brain regions active during the SD task only the activity in the parietal regions reflected the demands (i.e., the differences in social distances between self and two persons) of SD task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004360-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Further, the activation was observed in the SD task, while the region became silent in the SF task where self-referential evaluation of a person was not particularly required, even though the brain had to process the same sets of facial pictures. Thus, it seems that self-referential (egocentric) evaluation of social compatibility with a person engages the intraparietal regions that are associated with the self-referential assessment of physical distance. In general, one should carefully interpret roles of common activations across multiple tasks. However, it might be also true that activations in the same brain region shared between tasks may indicate that the tasks commonly, at least partly, require neuronal computation implemented on neuronal machinery of the specific brain region. In this vein, egocentric evaluation of social compatibility with a person might require a brain function of self-referential assessment of &#x02018;distance&#x02019; in the parietal cortex.</p><p>The context-dependent involvement of intraparietal cortex is further supported by the present PPI analysis. Namely, both the SD and SF tasks engaged the fusiform gyrus that plays an essential role in the facial processing, but functional coupling of activities between the fusiform gyrus and the parietal cortex in the left hemisphere was specifically enhanced in the SD task. This suggests that when the brain has to evaluate social compatibility with a person based on his/her facial appearance, the information processed in the facial processing area needs further computation for the evaluation of social distance. The parietal cortex in the dorsal pathway seems to be best situated for this neuronal computation. Thus, the findings from our analyses all suggest the predominant importance of the intraparietal cortex for the neuronal computation of the social distance evaluation, and the human parietal cortex may have social-cognitive function in spatial terms that is analogous to its intrinsic properties of spatial function.</p><p>Our ability to judge human relationship in spatial terms may have its evolutionary root in the ontologically older neural substrates for spatial processing. Converting a function of particular brain region related to an ontologically older processing of physical world into the processing for mental world could be a basic and general strategy of the brain. The present study may provide an example of this extending function in human social cognition.</p><p>In order to share a brain function between analyses of physical and mental worlds, mental quantity should be represented as abstract magnitude of it. Human parietal cortex appears also to be specialized for this purpose because parietal cortex participates in mental rotation task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Bonda1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and in the processing of magnitudes of temporal discrepancy and of numerical differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Walsh1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Piazza1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Our present findings extend the cortical network of social cognition to the parietal cortex by suggesting that the parietal cortex subserves analytic functions in evaluating social relationships &#x0005b;c.f. 32&#x0005d;. In past studies on the neural underpinning of social cognition, much focus has been given to emotional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-BaronCohen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Frith2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and reward-related brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Izuma1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Zink1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Growing evidence in non-human primate supports the involvement of the parietal cortex in the social evaluation. Neurons in the intraparietal sulcus exhibit activities that appear to represent values regarding other agents such as female, subordinate and dominant moneys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Klein1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, neuronal activities in the intraparietal sulcus are modulated in a context-dependent manner under a circumstance where &#x02018;social&#x02019; hierarchy exists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Fujii1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. While neurons in the intraparietal sulcus are classically implicated in the spatial processing of depth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Sakata1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004360-Sakata2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, those primitive &#x02018;social&#x02019; functions seem to be supported by neurons in the parietal cortex. However, the most striking difference between our human observation and the monkey studies might be that humans can evaluate social distance from other agents based solely on their unfamiliar facial pictures by mentally simulating future outcomes from the cooperation with the agents.</p><p>In summary, we found activity in the parietal cortex in connection with a task involving self-referential judgments of social distance. The location of this parietal activity overlapped with areas activated during judgment of spatial distance, suggesting a shared cognitive mechanism, perhaps one of distances in the abstract. This may help explain the linguistic, psychological and behavioural connections between the concepts of the physical and social spaces. Taken together, it seems that parietal cortex may have evolved beyond its original purpose of analyzing physical space, to work as a multi-purpose module for computing abstract distances. Such a co-opting of spatial processing for the purposes of social cognition would seem useful in an evolutionary context, given the scale, complexity and abstractness of relationship networks in human societies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>A doll-arranging task</title><p>Fifteen participants (12 male and 3 female; ages 20&#x02013;32 years) spatially arranged 6-cm-high dolls on a 30&#x000d7;30-cm stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004360-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Each doll had a small dot on its vertex, which was used in the distance analysis (see below). Each participant was first asked to place a white doll (representing self) and a black doll (representing an incompatible person) wherever they liked on the stage. A total of 12 dolls, each of which had a facial picture of an unfamiliar person, were tested. The pictures were selected from a publicly available facial picture database (see below), and all were also used in the fMRI experiment. The participants randomly picked one doll at a time, and if they felt that they would be compatible with the person in real life, they had to place it anywhere on the stage. All participants completed this task within 5 minutes. We took a picture from just above the final arrangement of dolls. The size of stage in the picture was edited (300&#x000d7;300 pixels) by a computer software, and we counted the number of pixels to measure distances between the self and compatible/incompatible dolls. When multiple compatible dolls were selected, the average distance was calculated. The doll-arranging task was a virtually modified version of the social measurement that was done to measure spatial distance between persons by carefully observing human natural social behaviors (10, 11). This task was designed to be easily done in an experimental room. Even though we have not directly tested the validity and reliability of the task in the evaluation of psychological (social) distance, together with the previous findings, the present doll-arranging task may conveniently evaluate our tendency to regulate &#x0201c;personal space&#x0201d; based on the degree of social compatibility with others.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>fMRI participants</title><p>Twenty-four healthy male (20) and female (4) volunteers (ages 19&#x02013;34 years) participated in the fMRI experiment.

We used, with permission, facial pictures from a publicly available facial picture database produced by Softopia Japan (Gifu, Japan) for educational and research purposes. The database consists of facial (neutral) pictures of Japanese males and females across a fairly wide range of generations (ages 15&#x02013;64 years). We used this database because Japanese faces would be more familiar to the participants, though the individual in the picture was unfamiliar. For the present study, we selected pictures of 36 males and 36 females ranging from 20 to 35 years of age (roughly the same generation as that of the participants). Pictures were paired off in order of age, within the same gender. Each trial stimulus comprised one of these 36 pairs, and each pair was used twice to counterbalance the left-right positions, making a total of 72 trials.</p><p>This task was also repeated outside the scanner, with an additional rating task after each trial. Participants were asked to rate the difference between the two people with respect to the main social distance task with a score ranging from 1 (small difference) to 5 (large difference).

Thus, the button to be pressed in a session was predetermined. This order was also counterbalanced in a participant.

Thus, the fMRI phase of the experiment consisted of 10 sessions. The purpose of the present study was to see if the parietal cortex likely active in physical distance judgment is also engaged in social distance judgment. In order to reduce confounding factors by performing these two tasks in a mixed manner, we separated the physical and social sessions. The physical (PD and PC) sessions were conducted before the social (SD, SF and SC) sessions for one half of the participants, and vice versa for the other half. Within this constraint, the order of the sessions was randomized across participants. This was done to avoid confusion of responses under the situation where the participants had to make different judgment to the identical set of visual stimuli. As both control sessions (PC and SC) were performed just before or immediately after their experimental sessions (PD, SD and SF), effect of low-frequency drift of BOLD signal could be eliminated in the contrast (e.g. PD vs. PC) even though this was not perfect.</p><p>Each 36-trial session was divided into six blocks. Each block contained six 4-s trials (a 3-s stimulus followed by a 1-s blank), for a total of 24 s (six functional images) per block.

The mean RT for each category in each task was calculated for each participant.

Each block in a session was modelled with a boxcar function delayed by 4 s and convoluted with the standard SPM5 hemodynamic response function. We defined a linear contrast in the general linear model to identify activity that was exclusively related to the PD task by directly comparing it with activity obtained in the control task (PD vs. PC). By this procedure, we may depict brain areas that play essential roles in the PD task and are distinct from those simply related to visual processing and motor response. The same procedure was used to identify activity exclusively related to the SD task (SD vs. SC) as well as to the SF task (SF vs. SC). The participants processed identical sets of facial pictures in the SD and SF tasks; therefore, we may expect some brain regions are active in both tasks. To identify these brain regions, we tested a contrast &#x0005b;(SD&#x0002b;SF) vs. 2&#x0002a;SC&#x0005d;. Finally, as we hypothesised, we found that the PD and SD tasks activated similar regions in the parietal cortices that were not active during the SF task.

First, we individually calculated the mean rating for each 6-trial fMRI blocks (12 blocks per participant). Then, we performed parametric modulation analysis between the ratings and effect size in the block. Effect size was obtained by comparing activity during the block with activity in the 8-s inter-block intervals. We first tested this in each participant, and then performed the random effect group analysis to accommodate inter-participant variability. In this second-level analysis, we used the contrast image (SD vs. SC) as an inclusive mask (p&#x0003c;0.05 corrected) to restrict the search space, which ensures that only voxels belonging to active clusters in the SD task were included. One-sample t-test was used (23 degrees of freedom). The same T-value (3.48) was used to generate the cluster images.

We constructed a linear regression model (general linear model) using the PPI regressor as well as the SD and SF regressors used in the first analysis (boxcar&#x000d7;hemodynamic response). Hence, this analysis was specific to the context-dependent influence of each region that occurred over and above the effects of the two tasks.

For the purposes of the plot illustrating activities between the left fusiform gyrus and the left intraparietal cortex in a representative participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004360-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), we excluded the data from the first volume of each block (<italic>N</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;60) to allow for the hemodynamic delay.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Dr. Chris Frith, Dr. Geraint Rees, Dr. Roi Cohen Kadosh, Dr. Bahador Bahrami and Dr. Daw-An Wu for their valuable comments on the early version of manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0004360-Frith1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Frith</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><name><surname>Wolpert</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>NetLibrary</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><year>2004</year><comment>The Neuroscience of Social Interaction: Decoding, Imitating, and Influencing the Actions of Others (Oxford University Press)</comment></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004360-Goleman1"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Goleman</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><year>2006</year><comment>Social Intelligence : The New Science of Human Relationships (Bantam)</comment></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004360-Bogardus1"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bogardus</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name></person-group><year>1959</year><source>Social Distance</source><publisher-loc>Yellow Springs, Ohio</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Antioch</publisher-name></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004360-Akerlof1"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Akerlof</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name></person-group><year>1997</year><article-title>Social Distance and Social Decisions.</article-title><source>Econometrica</source><volume>65</volume><fpage>1005</fpage><lpage>1028</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004360-Hoffman1"><label>5</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hoffman</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>McCabe</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>VL</given-names></name></person-group><year>1996</year><article-title>Social Distance and Other-Regarding Behavior in Dictator Games.</article-title><source>AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW</source><volume>86</volume><fpage>653</fpage><lpage>660</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004360-Charness1"><label>6</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Charness</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Gneezy</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name></person-group><year>2008</year><article-title>What's in a name?
