Tunicamycin triggered increased phosphorylation of both serine 473 and threonine 308 by 4 hours, consistent with Akt activation; phosphorylation declined by 8 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Pharmacological inhibition of Akt attenuated the tunicamycin-induced transcription of IAP mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) indicating that PERK and Akt contribute to IAP mRNA accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>IAP translation is induced by ER stress in a PERK-dependent manner</title><p id="P14">The above results reveal a role for Akt in the UPR-dependent accumulation of cIAP mRNA. We noted however that IAP proteins continue to accumulate at time points at which IAP mRNA levels are declining, suggesting additional levels of regulation. We therefore evaluated the contribution of PERK and Akt to the induction of IAP protein. Wild-type or Akt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs were challenged with tunicamycin and IAP levels were determined by western analysis. Strikingly, Akt1 deficiency did not prevent stress-induced accumulation of IAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Although cIAP protein accumulation is not disrupted in Akt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs, it is possible that Akt isoforms Akt2 or Akt3 become activated by stress in the absence of Akt1, leading to IAP induction. The stress-mediated induction of a phosphorylated Akt isoform in Akt1&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells is evidence of this possibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). We therefore used a small molecule inhibitor of Akt to inhibit all Akt isoforms. Wild-type MEFs were treated with tunicamycin, Akt inhibitor, or both. Coincident treatment of cells with tunicamycin and the Akt inhibitor did partially attenuated ER stress-induced accumulation of cIAP1 and cIAP2 protein; however this inhibition was not complete as cIAP protein was still induced upon tunicamycin treatment in the presence of the Akt inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Similar results were observed in cells the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (data not shown). Thus, while Akt activation and induction of cIAP mRNA contribute to the expression of cIAP protein during ER stress, this transcriptional response is not sufficient for the maximal induction of cIAP protein. As PERK plays a crucial role in regulating cellular translation during stress, we next determined whether the continued accumulation of cIAPs reflected a PERK-dependent increase in translation.</p><p id="P15">Although PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; generally inhibits protein translation, translation of some transcripts, such as that of ATF4, are paradoxically induced by eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Fernandez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Harding <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Vattem and Wek, 2004</xref>).

It is of interest to note that expression of cIAP1 resulted in increased accumulation of cIAP2.

Tunicamycin treatment increased SMAC-associated cIAP1 and cIAP2, and a corresponding decrease in SMAC-associated XIAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Because cells deficient for PERK are acutely sensitive to ER stress, an understanding of the pro-survival mechanisms initiated by PERK activity may reveal therapeutic targets for cancer as well as other UPR-based pathologies. The pro-survival mechanisms that have been described downstream of PERK are adaptive programs that reduce the cytotoxic consequences of the stress that a cell incurs. The current work demonstrates that in addition to the adaptive pathways downstream of PERK, once a cell has reached a critical level of stress, PERK also mediates cell survival through the selective induction of the IAP family proteins. ER stress-induced expression of cIAPs coincides with reduced activation of caspases, suggesting an inhibitory effect of IAPs on the ER stress-induced apoptotic program. Our results confirm previously reported data that suggests IAPs are transcriptionally induced in an Akt-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hu et al., 2004</xref>). Our data demonstrate that IAP mRNA is transiently induced early during the ER stress response. This induction coincides temporally with ER stress-induced Akt activity and is attenuated by Akt inhibition. While the specific transcription factors downstream of Akt have not been identified, NF&#x003ba;B remains a likely candidate. Akt promotes NF&#x003ba;B activity by phosphorylating and activating I&#x003ba;B kinase, leading to NF&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation and transcription of its target genes, which include cIAP1 and cIAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Bellacosa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Debatin and Krammer, 2004</xref>). While ER stress can induce NF&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity in a PERK-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">Deng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>), the role of Akt activity in ER stress-induced NF&#x003ba;B activation has not been addressed.</p><p id="P22">Importantly, while IAP transcription does increase following ER stress, our results indicate that increased expression is not necessary for IAP induction. Inhibition of Akt effectively inhibited IAP mRNA accumulation, but did not inhibit protein accumulation suggesting an alternative mechanism contributes to IAP protein accumulation during ER stress. Indeed, our data demonstrates that IAP mRNA is preferentially translated during the ER stress response in a PERK and eIF2&#x003b1;-dependent manner. While phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; is associated with attenuation of protein synthesis, translation of specific transcripts is induced by eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation. The mRNAs of the transcription factor ATF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Harding et al., 2000a</xref>) and the cationic amino acid transporter Cat-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Fernandez et al., 2002b</xref>) contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5&#x02019;-untranslated regions (5&#x02019;UTR) that repress translation under basal conditions, but allow for efficient translation when eIF2&#x003b1; is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Schroder and Kaufman, 2005</xref>). The 5&#x02019;UTRs of both human and mouse cIAP1 and cIAP2 contain uORFs, suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism.</p><p id="P23">Alternatively, translational regulation of IAPs could reflect the presence of putative internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). IRES elements have been reported for cIAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Warnakulasuriyarachchi et al., 2004</xref>) mRNA, suggesting additional mechanisms by which cells upregulate IAPs during ER stress. IRES elements in the cIAP1 mRNA may explain why, in our hands, inhibition of Akt alone upregulates cIAP1 protein expression.</p><p id="P24">Although reintroduction of cIAP expression into PERK&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells during ER stress only partially rescues these cells from apoptosis, it is important to note that PERK mediates cellular adaptation to ER stress through multiple mechanisms. We thus did not expect to completely rescue PERK&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis by reintroducing only one mechanism by which PERK mediates survival.</p><p id="P25">Interestingly, the expression of the most potent IAP, XIAP is not induced by ER stress. XIAP directly inhibits caspases-3, -7, and &#x02013;9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Deveraux et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Scott et al., 2005</xref>; Shiozaki et al., 2003). Although not direct caspase inhibitors, cIAPs are believed function as modulators of XIAP activity through the sequestration of SMAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Eckelman and Salvesen, 2006</xref>). Our data is consistent with this hypothesis as ER stress-induced expression of cIAP proteins leads to a reduction of XIAP in SMAC immunoprecipitates. Thus, while XIAP protein levels are not induced by ER stress, there is a net increase XIAP through PERK-dependent cIAP induction. The importance of XIAP activity for survival of ER stress is highlighted by the fact that knockdown of XIAP dramatically sensitizes cells to tunicamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>); our unpublished results).</p><p id="P26">The activation of Akt may also directly affect XIAP activity during ER stress as Akt has been demonstrated to phosphorylate and thus stabilize XIAP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Dan et al., 2004</xref>). The transient activation of Akt during ER stress may thus regulate cellular levels of XIAP protein, and possibly contribute the loss of XIAP protein observed at later hours of ER stress.</p><p id="P27">Another possible and intriguing role for cIAP1 and cIAP2 in ER stress may lie in the modulation of death receptor signaling. Signaling downstream of TNF&#x003b1; can be either pro-survival or pro-apoptotic and cIAPs are crucial for pro-survival signaling through the TNF&#x003b1; receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Wang et al., 1998a</xref>). Autocrine TNF&#x003b1; pro-apoptotic signaling can occur during ER stress through IRE1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Hu et al., 2006</xref>). However, the role of cIAP1 and cIAP2 in ER stress-induced TNF&#x003b1; signaling has not been addressed. While we failed to detect a change of TNF&#x003b1; levels in the media of fibroblasts treated with tunicamycin (unpublished data), the critical role of cIAPs in protecting tumor cells from TNF&#x003b1;-induced apoptosis is becoming increasingly clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Bertrand et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Petersen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Varfolomeev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Vince et al., 2007</xref>). Given these observations, PERK inhibition, as a therapeutic strategy may not only eliminate the ability of cells to adapt to the tumor microenvironment, but also induce the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in tumor cells that excrete TNF&#x003b1;. Future experiments will be required to determine the role of PERK in maintaining tumor cIAP levels and viability <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P28">A striking finding is that ER stress-mediated activation of Akt is completely dependent on PERK. The precise mechanism whereby Akt is activated during ER stress is under current investigation. We and others have observed that this activation is dependent on PI3-kinase activity as ER stress-induced Akt phosphorylation is ablated by the presence of LY294002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hosoi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hu et al., 2004</xref>),our unpublished results. We have also observed induction of PI3K activity in <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays after prior treatment of cells with tunicamycin (our unpublished data). This activation of PI3K is independent of extracellular growth factor signaling, as Akt becomes activated by ER stress in the absence of serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>); unpublished data).</p><p id="P29">A recent report suggests that activation of PI3K occurs downstream of the eIF2&#x003b1; kinase PKR, suggesting that PI3K and Akt activation is a property of all eIF2&#x003b1; kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kazemi et al., 2007</xref>). Elucidation of the mechanism by which eIF2&#x003b1; kinases activate PI3-kinase is of great interest as signaling pathways downstream of PI3K bring to light a myriad of new, unexplored mechanisms by which cells respond to stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S8"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Cell Culture and Materials</title><p id="P30">Cell lines were maintained in MEF Media (Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle&#x02019;s Medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini), Penicillin/Streptomycin (Cellgro), nonessential amino acids (Gibco), L-glutamine (Cellgro), and &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol (Gibco). eIF2&#x003b1; S51A homozygous knock-in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were a gift from Donalyn Scheuner and Randal Kaufman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Scheuner et al., 2001</xref>).
