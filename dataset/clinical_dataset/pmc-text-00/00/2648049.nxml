Erectile dysfunction is still a significant contributor to postoperative morbidity following radical prostatectomy, despite meticulous nerve-sparing technique.  Secondary smooth muscle changes in the penis have been identified as the underlying causes of penile atrophy, veno-occlusive dysfunction, and fibrosis. Initial observations that intracavernous injection therapies used on a regular basis postoperatively resulted in improvements in the return of spontaneous erectile function led to the development of penile rehabilitation protocols.

Introduction</title><p>Erectiledysfunction (ED) continues to be a significant complaint among men undergoingradical prostatectomy (RP), despite meticulous nerve-sparing technique. Thediscrepancy between preservation of the nerves and recovery of erectile functionleads us to believe that the etiology is likely multifactorial. Smooth musclealterations and fibrotic changes in the penis following surgery were identifiedas underlying causes of penile atrophy, veno-occlusive dysfunction, andPeyronie's-like changes. Other mechanisms, such as penile hypoxia, are likelyto contribute to post-RP erectile dysfunction as well.</p><p>The topicof penile rehabilitation therapy (PRT) has become an area of intense interestover the last decade. Initial observations that intracavernous injectiontherapies used on a regular basis postoperatively resulted in improvements inthe return of spontaneous erectile function led to the development of penilerehabilitation protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A central question is whether vasoactivetherapies, such as oral type V phosphodiesterase (PDE-V) inhibitors andintracavernous or intraurethral alprostadil, can lessen or reverse the effectsof causative factors for ED. As several recent articles in Advances in Urologyhave thoroughly reviewed the benefits of PRT, the purpose of this article is toprovide caution to the present enthusiasm for penile rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. Penile Injury Following RP: Basic Science</title><p>The basicscience behind the mechanism of erection has been discussed previously and isbeyond the scope of this review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. With that said, it is important that weunderstand the underlying hypothesis of penile rehabilitation therapy. In the 1990s, it was recognized thatdenervation injury to the penis affects the cavernous smooth muscle. This is similar to the skeletal muscleatrophy that is seen following spinal cord injury. Using a rat model, Klein et al. were the first to demonstratethat denervation of the penis leads to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Then in 2003, User andMcVary were able to show penile apoptosis as early as 1 day after cavernousnerve ablation in a rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This apoptotic process is directly relatedto atrophy and fibrosis. The hypothesis is that PDE-V inhibitors promote penilerehabilitation by stimulating smooth muscle cell replacement via a cGMPmechanism and reducing collagen synthesis via phosphokinase G activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. By performing percutaneous penile biopsies at the time of RP and 6 monthslater, Schwartz et al. were the first to demonstrate that early use of 100 mgof sildenafil after RP may preserve intracorporeal smooth muscle content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Interestingly, those taking 50 mg of sildenafil under the same dosing regimenshowed no statistically significant change in smooth muscle content. There was no control group in this study andonly 21 of the enrolled 40 men were available for follow-up. The effects on thelong-term return of erectile function were not determined. Rajfer et al. from UCLA demonstrated inseveral studies that rats treated with PDE-V inhibitors had no significantincrease in the penile shaft collagen content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These studies haveprovided important animal model documentation of the benefit of PDE-V inhibitortherapy for the prevention of functional and histologic changes in the penisthat can occur after nerve damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec3"><title>3. Limitations of Present Clinical Studies</title><p>While there have been many studies in the rat modelshowing the benefits of local vasoactive therapies, the crossover to clinicalsignificance in the human has been more difficult to prove (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Montorsi et al. showed in 1997 that men who performed penile injections had asuperior rate of return of adequate erections following RP than men who did notdo injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, the study did not include preoperative parametersof erectile function or the use of a validated questionnaire. Also, the smallnumber of patients included in the study decreases its power. Additionally, the short duration of follow-up of 12 weeks limits anyconclusions regarding long-term impact of therapy. Nevertheless, this study wasthe first clinical report to suggest a benefit of a penile rehabilitationstrategy using a pharmacologic therapy.</p><p>The evidence for the use of oral agents for penilerehabilitation is even weaker. In 2005, Mulhall et al. reported in a nonrandomizedstudy that men who underwent pharmacologic penile rehabilitation following RPresulted in higher rates of spontaneous functional erections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Men who hadfully functional erections by self-report preoperatively were encouraged toparticipate in a penile rehabilitation program for at least 12 months followingsurgery. Patients who decided to participate constituted the rehabilitationgroup, while those who decided not to participate but presented for follow-upfor periodic evaluation of their erectile function constituted thenonrehabilitation group. There were 58 men in the rehabilitation group and 74in the nonrehabilitation group, but no placebo arm. This study had a strongpatient selection bias, as patients were allowed to select treatment orobservation. In addition, only men who completed 18 months of therapy wereincluded, meaning that men who dropped out due to lack of efficacy were notpart of the analysis.</p><p>The benefit induced by a PDE-V inhibitorrehabilitation approach compared to an on demand PDE-V administration has notbeen confirmed. In a follow-up to their first study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], Montorsi et al. prospectively studied a cohort of 80 patients submitted to bilateral NSRRP withadequate erectile function data 12 months after surgery, as presented in theirabstract at the 2006 annual meeting of the American Urological Association[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Patients were assigned to fourdifferent groups: no erectile therapy,intracavernosal injection of prostaglandin E-1 on demand, PDE-V inhibitor ondemand, and PDE-V inhibitor therapy either daily or every other day for 3months. No significant difference was found in the mean IIEF score betweenpatients treated with daily therapy versus on demand therapy.</p><p>Bannowsky et al. from Germany reported in 2008 theirfindings of low-dose sildenafil for rehabilitating erectile function afternerve-sparing RP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Twenty-three men with preserved erectile function basedon Rigiscan testing 1-2 weekspostoperatively received sildenafil 25 mg nightly versus 18 men who receivedplacebo for 52 weeks. There was a significant difference in IIEF-5 score andtime of recovery of erectile function between the groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001),with potency rates of 86% versus 66%. The authors concluded that in cases ofearly penile erection, daily low-dose sildenafil leads to a significantimprovement in the recovery of erectile function. However, the limitations tothis study are that it was performed at a single center and 95% of patients hadnocturnal erections following catheter removal, which is not typical.</p><p>Padma-Nathan et al. performed the first randomized,placebo-controlled trial of chronic PDE-V inhibitor therapy for the purposes ofpenile rehabilitation and presented their findings at the 2003 AmericanUrological Association annual meeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. They concluded that nightlyadministration of sildenafil for 9 months following nerve-sparing radicalretropubic prostatectomy (NSRRP) increased the return of spontaneous erectionscompared with placebo. However, this study has been criticized for theseemingly low percentage (4%) of men considered responders in the placebo arm. Additionally, the criteria for being considered a responder were stringent, asresponders were defined as those having a combined score of &#x0003e;8 for IIEF Q3and 4 and positive response to the question &#x0201c;Over the past 4 weeks, have yourerections been good enough for satisfactory sexual activity?&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] The findingsof this study were recently published in the International Journal of ImpotenceResearch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>A subset of these men hadnocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity (NPTR) testing performedpreoperatively and at various time points postoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The authorsconcluded that nightly sildenafil objectively improved nocturnal erectionsversus placebo.</p><p>The limitation of this study is that while being suggestive, nocturnal tumescence data interpretation does notnecessarily correlate with return of clinically usable erections.</p><p>In contrast, in the largest randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, parallel study done to date, Montorsi et al. recently reported on a vardenafil trial after bilateral nerve-sparing RP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A total of 628 men were randomized to placebo, nightly vardenafil, or on demand vardenafil for 9 months, followed by a 2-month washout period, and an optional 2-month open-label period. The results clearly show that nightly dosing with vardenafil did not have any effect beyond that of on demand use. Following washout, IIEF-EF scores &#x02265;22 were achieved in 28.9%, 24.1%, and 29.1% of patients for placebo, vardenafil nightly, and vardenafil on demand groups, respectively, showing no statistically significant difference among the groups. Mean per-patient success rates for intercourse completion were not significantly different among treatment groups either. While on demand dosing was efficacious, nightly vardenafil for the purpose of penile rehabilitation was not efficacious. This well-designed study provides a cautionary note for the present enthusiasm of oral PDE-V inhibitors for penile rehabilitation therapy. The authors concluded that: &#x0201c;the finding that on demand dosing is more effective in improving both erectile function and sexual intercourse completion rates within this patient population prompts reconsideration of the current practice of prescribing nightly PDE5 inhibitor therapy, as on demand use of vardenafil if equally effective in men with ED following NSRP.&#x0201d;</p><p>Point-counterpoint debates have become commonregarding the efficacy of penile rehabilitation following RP. In one such example, Abraham Morgentalerfrom Harvard University listed several intriguing arguments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. First, hequestioned the theory that penile rehabilitation helps to reverse the chronichypoxia and ischemia of the flaccid penis following RP. &#x0201c;But why is there reasonto suspect that the flaccid penis is hypoxic, despite having venous oxygentension? After all, the endothelium of all venous structures suffers no illeffects despite a lifetime of exposure to oxygen levels that are well belowthose seen in arterial blood. Second,there is no reason to believe that the penis is ischemic following RP. If it were ischemic, would it not eventuallybecome necrotic? Furthermore, PDE-Vinhibitors do not increase blood flow to the flaccid penis, so how can benefitoccur?&#x0201d;</p><p>Similarly, in a more recent point-counterpointdebate at the 2008 AUA Annual Meeting in Orlando, Fla, Craig Donatuccifrom Duke University was charged with providing the contrary argument as whether penilerehabilitation was effective after RP. He presented many of the same points listed above, describing thepitfalls of the clinical trials that have been presented thus far. He stated: &#x0201c;There is not yet enough evidenceto declare penile rehabilitation effective; but I am not sufficiently convincedof the ineffectiveness of penile rehabilitation to recommend against it. Myopinion is that the benefits of penile rehabilitation are &#x0201c;not proven&#x0201d;; yet itis currently the standard of care&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec4"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>The study of penile rehabilitation is in activeevolution. There are intriguing data supporting the use of penilerehabilitation in the animal model, but these studies may not translate intohuman effect. While many published reports of clinical trials point towardimproved outcomes with active treatment, these studies have significantlimitations. Most recently, the onlylarge, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to date showed no clear benefit ofrehabilitation with vardenafil versus on demand dosing. In fact, quite theopposite was shown. Clearly, more randomized, placebo-controlled trials areneeded. Unfortunately, these presentmany challenges. First, these trials prove costly with poor long-termcompliance and significant early dropout rates. Second, it cannot be overlookedthat differences in nerve-sparing technique and outcomes between surgeons canconfound interpretation of results. Eventhough the benefits of penile rehabilitation are still questionable, thepractice of frequent and chronic administration of PDE-V inhibitors has becomestandard of care for many urologists. We suggest proceeding with caution whenencouraging our patients to adhere to a rehabilitation regimen, until moredefinitive results are available.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref
