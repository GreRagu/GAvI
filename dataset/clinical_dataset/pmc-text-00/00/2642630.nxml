The MJ was, up to a recent period, completely unknown at the molecular level. Recently, proteins originated from two distinct post-Golgi specialised secretory organelles, the micronemes (for AMA1) and the neck of the rhoptries (for RON2/RON4/RON5 proteins), have been shown to form a complex. AMA1 and RON4 in particular, have been localised to the MJ during invasion. Using biochemical approaches, we have identified RON8 as an additional member of the complex. We also demonstrated that all RON proteins are present at the MJ during invasion. Using metabolic labelling and immunoprecipitation, we showed that RON2 and AMA1 were able to interact in the absence of the other members. We also discovered that all MJ proteins are subjected to proteolytic maturation during trafficking to their respective organelles and that they could associate as non-mature forms <italic>in vitro</italic>. Finally, whereas AMA1 has previously been shown to be inserted into the parasite membrane upon secretion, we demonstrated, using differential permeabilization and loading of RON-specific antibodies into the host cell, that the RON complex is targeted to the host cell membrane, where RON4/5/8 remain associated with the cytoplasmic face. Globally, these results point toward a model of MJ organization where the parasite would be secreting and inserting interacting components on either side of the MJ, both at the host and at its own plasma membranes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>A unique feature of apicomplexan parasites is the formation of an intimate contact between the apex of the parasite and the host cell membrane called the moving junction that moves along the parasite during invasion. Proteins originated from two distinct secretory organelles, the microneme for AMA1 and the rhoptry neck for RON2/4/5 proteins, are associated to form the junction. Here, we have furthered the characterization of the MJ complex by describing RON8, an additional protein component. AMA1 has previously been shown to be inserted into the parasite membrane upon secretion. Our study demonstrates that all the RON proteins are translocated into the host cell, where RON4/5/8 remain associated with the cytoplasmic face of the host cell plasma membrane. Furthermore, we identified a privileged interaction between transmembrane MJ proteins AMA1 and RON2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Overall, this led us to propose the first model describing the putative MJ organisation at the interface between the host cell and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. In this original concept, the parasite would export its own receptor (RON2) and ligand (AMA1) on either side of the MJ.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Invasion by Apicomplexa is an essential step of the pathologies associated with these protozoan parasites that include <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., the causative agents of malaria, as well as <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, responsible for human and animal toxoplasmosis. The invasive stages of these parasites share a highly conserved architecture, including a cytoskeleton-associated original pellicular complex, and two types of vesicular apical organelles (micronemes and rhoptries) that participate to the invasion process through the exocytosis of their contents in a sequential manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Carruthers1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Host cell invasion has been well described at the ultrastructural level, but the precise molecular interactions and the specific role of the exocytosed parasite proteins are still poorly understood. Proteins located on the surface of the parasite probably mediate the initial interaction with the target cell. This is followed by an intimate contact between the apical tip of the parasite and the host cell membrane, called the moving junction (MJ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Aikawa1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. This singular structure, likely linked to the subpellicular cytoskeleton motor of the parasite, might serve as a support to propel the parasite into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that forms inside the host cell. To do so, the MJ rapidly turns into a ring that is moved backward along the parasite during invasion and ends up at the posterior end of the invaded parasite at the end of the process. Despite a number of investigations having led to the discovery of a variety of putative parasite adhesive molecules secreted from micronemes, and of an original acto-myosin based motor for gliding motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Keeley1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, the process of invasion itself (i.e. MJ-dependent host cell entry), remains a major conundrum. Indeed, although the morphological features of the process have been described 30 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Aikawa1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, the MJ was, up to a recent period, completely unknown at the molecular level. The major reason for this was its transient nature, since host cell invasion is a very rapid process (a few seconds), and therefore isolating the structure was not possible.</p><p>Rhoptries are elongated organelles composed of a bulbous body that tapers into a thin duct-like neck. Rhoptries empty their contents apically during the invasion process, after microneme exocytosis, and their contribution to invasion was considered mostly as providing building material for the developing PV, since proteins of the bulb of the rhoptry (ROPs) were found associated with the nascent vacuole membrane (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Dubremetz1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>). Recently, an unexpected function of the rhoptries in MJ formation arose from the discovery that one rhoptry neck protein (RON4) was associated to the MJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Alexander1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Lebrun1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. It was proposed that MJ formation would derive from a cooperation between i) newly discovered RONs located in the rhoptry neck and ii) the micronemal protein AMA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Alexander1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Numerous lines of evidence suggest that the conserved AMA1 protein plays a central role during invasion of Apicomplexa. For instance, AMA1 has been shown to be essential for <italic>Plasmodium</italic> merozoites and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> tachyzoites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Mital1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Triglia1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>T. gondii</italic>, AMA1 and RON4 have been found to be associated in a complex <italic>in vitro</italic> and they localize precisely at the MJ during cell invasion, although a direct association of the two proteins has not been demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Alexander1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Lebrun1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The isolation of RON4 from parasite extracts by affinity purification led us to the simultaneous purification of the rhoptry neck protein RON2 and protein TwinScan_4705 (annotated also 583.m00636) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Lebrun1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, which was later shown to be also a RON (RON5, P. Bradley personal communication). Like AMA1, RONs are conserved throughout the Apicomplexa including <italic>Plasmodium spp.</italic>, and they are not found outside this phylum. AMA1 and RONs are stored in two distinct compartments that release their content sequentially during invasion. Cross-linking experiments on invading parasites showed that the interaction of AMA1 with RONs takes place during invasion and is not the result of non-specific or indirect binding occurring in the parasite lysate during IP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Alexander1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. One intriguing question is how the micronemal protein AMA1 and the complex of rhoptry neck proteins RON2/RON4/RON5 avoid interacting in the secretory pathway. Another important question is how these proteins are organized at the MJ. The microneme protein AMA1 has been characterized structurally and appears to be translocated as a type-1 transmembrane (TM) protein in the tachyzoite plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Hehl1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Donahue1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. On the contrary, the topology of the RONs at the MJ is still obscure and several important questions remain unanswered. Are RONs directly or indirectly linked to the parasite surface? Could they be binding to a host cell receptor or, as we speculated previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Lebrun1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, are they directly inserted into the host cell membrane to serve as a receptor for AMA1?</p><p>Here, we describe an additional partner of the previously characterized AMA1/RON2/4/5 complex named RON8. We also show that the complex may be assembled as pro-proteins but that a distinct timing of biosynthesis between MICs and RONs precludes the association of RONs with AMA1 before secretion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RONs are exported to the host cell membrane, RON/4/5/8 being exposed to the host cell cytosol and RON2 being probably an integral membrane protein that displays a privileged interaction with AMA1. These results provide an important clue to understand how such a crucial structure for the invasive and developmental processes of the parasite is built and organized.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of RON8 as an additional partner of the AMA1-RON2/4/5 complex</title><p>In order to further refine the molecular characterization the MJ complex of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, we searched for additional proteins co-immuno-purified (IP) by the anti-RON4 antibody matrix, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Lebrun1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The RON4-associated proteins were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. As in our first analysis, we detected two principal bands at &#x0223c;120 kDa and &#x0223c;100 kDa, which corresponded to RON2, RON4 and RON5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition to the proteins of the MJ already known to be associated with each other (RON2, RON4, RON5 and AMA1), mass spectrometry analysis identified peptides from proteins that are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000309.s007">Table S1</xref>. Peptides from proteins originated from the secretory organelles involved in invasion (microneme and rhoptry) have retained our attention. First, peptides from two microneme proteins MIC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Fourmaux1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and MIC3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-GarciaReguet1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> were detected. However, Western blot and reverse IP analysis using anti-MIC3 or anti-MIC1 antibodies did not confirm a specific interaction of these proteins with the MJ complex proteins (data not shown). Second, we found peptides from TwinScan_0092 (80.m02161) and TwinScan_2001 (541.m00141), two predicted <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> proteins that had also been detected in the proteomic analysis of the rhoptries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Bradley1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. TwinScan_0092 predicts a protein of 49 kDa that is not localising at the MJ but was instead found to be a new dense granule protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Michelin1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Concerning TwinScan_2001, a previous study using an antibody raised against a specific peptide had localised it to the apicoplast by IFA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Bradley1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, although it does not possess any <italic>bona fide</italic> plastid-targeting element in its amino acid sequence. We then decided to reassess its subcellular localization by generating a specific polyclonal antiserum directed against a recombinant TwinScan_2001 protein corresponding to the central part of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This antibody (anti-Tw2001) reacted on Western blot with a major band of about to 250 kDa and several minor bands of lower molecular mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), that were also detected with an additional serum raised against another region of the protein (not described here), but were absent when probed with the pre-immune serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000309.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). By IFA, the anti-Tw2001 serum recognized an antigen co-localized with RON4 in intracellular parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that TwinScan_2001 was a new rhoptry neck protein that we named RON8.</p><fig id="ppat-1000309-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000309.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Identification of an additional moving junction complex member, RON8.</title><p>(A) Isolation of RON4-associated proteins by immuno-affinity column.

The detection of RON2 in these conditions could be explained by the fact that the Cyt-D treatment had improved the accessibility of the protein to the antibody, either because it destabilised some link of RON2 with Cyt-D sensitive structures of the host or, more simply, that it blocked the junction in an early stage where the protein is more accessible. Overall, this is strengthening the idea that RON2, RON4, RON5 and RON8 are present together in the MJ complex during invasion.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>RON2 and AMA1 can interact together in the absence of RON4/5/8</title><p>The generation of antisera against the individual members of the MJ complex allowed us to analyse more precisely the RONs and their interactions by IP using different conditions for solubilization of the parasite.

After one hour of chase, the 150 kDa disappeared and the 120 kDa band was the major one detected. A 65 kDa band after chase and a slightly slower migrating one in the pulse corresponded to AMA1 (as described above) and proAMA1 respectively (see below). In non-reduced condition, the 150 kDa band was detected both in pulse and chase fractions, indicating that RON2 is processed and that the two fragments might be linked by internal disulfide bonds (several cysteines are present in both fragments). For RON5, after 20 minutes of pulse, a major protein of &#x0223c;180 kDa (unreduced) was immunoprecipitated, which is consistent with the predicted size of the protein. After one hour of chase, the 180 kDa product almost disappeared and a &#x0223c;150 kDa band was detected instead. In reduced condition, the 180 kDa form was also detected in pulse, while a &#x0223c;110 kDa form was immunoprecipitated after one hour of chase. A band of &#x0223c;30 kDa was also detected by Western blot on whole tachyzoites in reduced condition (data not shown) and was recovered by IP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000309.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These results indicated that RON5 is cleaved at least at two sites, one processing event resulting in removal of a pro-sequence (as for many ROP proteins), and another processing event yielding two polypeptides possibly bound by a disulfide bond (as for RON2). Concerning RON8, a processing event was also detected in reduced and non-reduced conditions, indicating that RON8 was also subjected to removal of a pro-sequence. Pulse-chase experiment for RON4 also showed that it is expressed as a pro-protein (&#x0223c;120 kDa reduced condition and &#x0223c;145 kDa unreduced) that is cleaved to yield a mature protein of &#x0223c;110 kDa (reduced) or &#x0223c;120 kDa (unreduced). One additional minor band of lower molecular mass was also sometimes present. The persistence of the immature form of RON4 after one hour of chase indicated that RON4 was only partially matured. This could be linked to the fact that, as shown before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Lebrun1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Bradley1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, part of RON4 is secreted in the PV (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and therefore avoids the rhoptry-specific processing compartment. Serendipitously, the generation of a transgenic parasite cell line expressing a Ty-tagged version of RON4 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000309.s008">Text S1</xref>) that was, for unknown reasons, entirely secreted in the vacuolar space (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000309.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) and remained entirely unprocessed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000309.s003">Figure S3B</xref>), strengthened this hypothesis.</p><p>In order to determine in which compartment the RONs were processed, we then generated antibodies directed against the RON8 pro-peptide.

Three putative TgSUB2 cleavage sites were found in RON8, two in RON5 and one in RON2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). We therefore raised antibodies against a peptide spanning RON8 AA 1-91, located before the first SFVE motif of the RON8 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). IP using anti-proRON8 demonstrated the specificity of the anti-proRON8 for the immature form of RON8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000309.s004">Figure S4A</xref>), whereas IFA showed reactivity restricted to the characteristic pre-rhoptry compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000309.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), which corresponds to the nascent rhoptries of daughter parasites during endodyogeny. The cleavage of all RONs beyond the ER was showed by pulse/chase analysis in the presence of the Golgi transport-inhibiting drug brefeldin A (BFA), pro-RONs remaining the only forms of the proteins at the end of the chase (data not shown and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>RONs and AMA1 can interact as pro-proteins</title><p>Since RONs undergo a proteolytic maturation, we analyzed if they could bind as immature proteins or if processing was required for this binding. To this end, we analyzed the MJ complex by pulse-chase experiments, followed by IP in lysis conditions known to preserve the association of the complex (using 1&#x00025; NP40). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, after a 15 min pulse, the immature forms of RON2, RON8 and RON5 could be recovered after IP with the anti-RON4 monoclonal. Similarly, and as a complementary approach, IP of the pro-forms of the other MJ partners was achieved using anti-RON2n, anti-RON5 or anti-RON8 (data not shown). To confirm these data, we checked for the association of the complex in BFA-treated cells that would express only immature radiolabeled RONs. As expected, in presence of the drug, proRON2 (150 kDa), proRON8 (329 kDa), proRON5 (180 kDa) and proRON4 (120 kDa, reduced) were the only species found at the end of the chase and co-precipitated together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

One possibility would be that they are synthesized sequentially and never coexist in the same compartment. We checked this hypothesis by IFA. Since maturation of both MICs and RONs occurs with rapid kinetics (MICs mature within 15-60 min, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Carruthers2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and the pro-sequence is only transiently detected by IFA, detection using anti-propeptide antibodies faithfully reflects the timing of their synthesis. We therefore performed double IFA with the rabbit polyclonal anti-pro-RON8 and the antiserum raised by Hehl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Hehl1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> against a peptide corresponding to the AMA1 pro-sequence (data not shown). Unfortunately, this anti-proAMA1 serum gave a very low signal/noise ratio and no significant data could be obtained with this probe. Since we had previously studied the fate of other microneme prodomains and showed for example that 80&#x00025; of the parasites co-expressed both pro-forms of microneme proteins M2AP and MIC3 simultaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-ElHajj1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, we reasoned that AMA1 could follow the same scheme and therefore decided to use the mouse anti-proMIC3 and the rabbit anti-proM2AP sera instead. Interestingly, no colocalization of proRON8 and proMIC3 was ever found and both markers were only observed simultaneously in &#x0223c;7&#x00025; of the parasites (&#x000b1;2&#x00025;, mean&#x000b1;SEM of 3 independent experiments; usually in very large parasites in mid-stages of endodyogeny) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g004">Figure 4C, upper panels</xref>).

Dual staining using rabbit anti-proM2AP serum and anti-RON4 showed that pre-rhoptry RON4 staining was almost never associated with a proM2AP staining in the same parasite (8.1&#x00025;&#x000b1;3&#x00025;, mean&#x000b1;SEM of 3 independent experiments) and apparently not in the same compartment, while RON2, RON5 and RON8 were systematically detected simultaneously with RON4 in pre-rhoptries in the same conditions (data not shown), confirming that RONs and MICs biosynthesis are asynchronous.

Abortive invasion has been previously documented in a recent mathematical model showing that approximately 55&#x00025; of the parasites detach within 5 min of initial attachment, but this paper did not conclude on whether the moving junction was built or not before detachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Kafsack1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. We thus assessed the presence of RONs in this particular situation. Dual IFA showed that all RONs could usually be detected as a punctuate signal, near the point of contact where the rhoptry content had apparently been initially discharged, as detected by anti-ROP1 staining in the host cell permeabilized with saponin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). RON2 was only detected with anti-RON2c, as reported above.

Instead, this appeared to reflect a specific association of the RONs with the host cell membrane. It is also to note that we could only rarely detect an AMA1 signal in these conditions. Indeed, quantitative analysis on three independent experiments showed that 89&#x00025;&#x000b1;2&#x00025; of the ROP1 evacuoles observed without parasites were RONs-positive while only 8.5&#x00025;&#x000b1;2&#x00025; of the ROP1 evacuoles observed without parasites were positive using the anti-AMA1 ectodomain B3.90 mAb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Hehl1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), strongly suggesting that the RONs and AMA1 associate with different membranes.</p><fig id="ppat-1000309-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000309.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Association of RONs with the host cell plasma membrane.</title><p>(A) A RON spot persists on cells after abortive interaction with a parasite in the presence of Cyt-D.

Since we had observed that the use of formaldehyde to fix parasite during invasion could result in partial permeabilization of the host cell membrane (data not shown), we stopped the invasion process on ice instead and performed the IFA on unfixed cells at 4&#x000b0;C. In these conditions, the MJ complex could not be detected unambiguously with any of the anti-RONs sera. The lack of detection of the epitopes by the antibodies could suggest either a lack of accessibility within the junction, or spatial and conformational constraints or, finally, a localization of these epitopes on the cytoplasmic side of the host cell membrane.</p><p>We thus addressed the possible association of RONs with the cytoplasmic face of the host plasma membrane. To this end, we examined the topology of the RONs at the MJ remnant in fully invaded parasites by differential permeabilization. Note that since RON2 was not detected at this residual junction, this approach did not allow defining the topology of RON2 in the host cell membrane. In streptolysin-O (SLO)-treated infected cells, the host cell plasma membrane was selectively permeabilized without affecting the PVM (Beckers <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994), allowing the selective detection of exposed cytosolic domains of PVM-associated protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

It is to note that this approach could not be used to assess the inhibitory effect of the anti-RONs on the invasion, as the amount of antibody loaded in the cells is variable and cannot be quantified.</p><p>Taken together, our results show that the parasites can secrete the RONs complex directly into the host cell cytoplasm, RON4, RON5 and RON8 remaining associated with the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane/PVM during invasion, after which they persist there for a few hours as a residual structure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The invasion process in Apicomplexa is unique among eukaryotic pathogens in that it involves a MJ structure that is used by the parasite to propel itself inside the cell using its gliding motion. Described morphologically more than 30 years ago, the composition of the structure is still poorly understood at the molecular level. A complex of four proteins AMA1/RON2/RON4/RON5 has been recently described, and two of these proteins (AMA1 and RON4) had been detected at the MJ, AMA1 being associated with the parasite membrane. We have completed the biochemical characterization of the complex and demonstrated that all the RONs are exported to the host cell membrane and, more surprisingly, three are exposed to the cytosolic face of the host cell membrane. The data we have obtained have led us to propose the first tentative model for the molecular organisation of the MJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat-1000309-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000309.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the MJ organisation model.</title><p>AMA1 is secreted from the micronemes at the surface of the parasite, whereas the RONs are secreted within the host cell and could serve as a receptor for AMA1 (left).

It is unclear how RONs are exported into the host cell and how they could insert into, or bind to, the host cell membrane, but a secretion of rhoptry material through a transient pore in the host cell membrane has been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Dubremetz1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Proteins from the bulb of the rhoptry (ROPs) are known to be secreted in association with vesicles (e-vacuoles) into the host cell cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Hakansson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, but this is likely to occur after junction formation and RONs are not found in e-vacuoles. RONs must therefore be translocated at a very early stage, likely corresponding to the transient spike of conductance detected by patch clamp study of <italic>T. gondii</italic> invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-SussToby1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. An association with lipids might also facilitate membrane insertion. RON4 and RON8, which are not predicted to possess a TM domain, are exposed to the cytoplasmic face of the host cell. RON5, which contains only one putative TM domain in its N-terminal end is, at least partially, exposed on this cytoplasmic face. Although we showed unambiguously that RON2 (which possesses three putative TM domains) is also a component of the MJ associated with the host cell, its precise topology at the membrane will need further studies. Indeed, whereas RON4/5/8 proteins are easily detected at the MJ, RON2 is only observed at a very early stage of junction formation or when the actin cytoskeleton is destabilized with Cyt-D, using a serum directed against a very short sequence located between the last two TM domains. This may reflect a direct or indirect interaction of this domain with the sub-plasmalemmal cytoskeleton, although invasion has been shown to critically depend on actin filaments of the parasite but not of the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Dobrowolski1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, only the last two TM domains of RON2 are unambiguously recognised by the prediction programs we used and the loop between these TM domains is particularly well conserved between all Apicomplexa RON2 orthologs, suggesting a conserved function.</p><p><italic>T. gondii</italic> develops within a vacuole that derives from the host cell membrane. A fascinating phenomenon in Apicomplexa invasion is the selective restricted access of host proteins to the forming vacuole in which the parasite develops. This molecular sieving takes place at the MJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Aikawa1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Mordue1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, the presence of RONs at the cytoplasmic face of the host cell could also be involved in the exclusion of host plasma membrane proteins from the PV membrane; they would constitute a selective and protective physical barrier that would prevent protein candidates, which could mediate the fusion of the PV with the endo-lysosomal system, to be incorporated and therefore creating a non-fusigenic compartment in which the parasite could develop. These results call for functional studies to assess the respective roles of the RONs in mediating a successful invasion.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Introducing its own receptor in the host cell membrane as a way for the parasite to circumvent host specificity?</title><p>A firm attachment of the parasite to the host cell membrane is necessary to propel it inside the PV. To do so, several scenarios might be envisaged. First, parasite ligands might be binding to host cell receptors. Another possibility is that parasite proteins, which would be directly inserted into the host cell membrane, could serve as receptors for the parasite through their extracellular domain. Our data fit perfectly with the latter scenario. Indeed, the parasite targets proteins on both membranes of the MJ; on the parasite surface for AMA1 via its TM domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Donahue1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and on the host cell membrane counterpart, for RON2/4/5/8 (this study). In addition, we have shown that AMA1 can interact directly with RON2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The domains interacting together still remain to be mapped. The precise function of AMA1 is not yet known, but several previous works showed a role of the protein in establishing close contact with the host cell suggesting that AMA1 could be involved in a receptor-ligand interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Mital1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. However direct binding of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> or <italic>T. gondii</italic> AMA1 to the target cell has not been proven unambiguously. Here we propose that the interaction of AMA1 with the host cell could be mediated by a RON2 receptor inserted into the host cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000309-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This model may account for the conserved mechanism of invasion by Apicomplexa. This type of secretion by a pathogen of a receptor for its own invasion machinery is reminiscent of the translocated intimin receptor (TIR) exported by enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Kenny1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, but it would be the first one to be characterised for a eukaryotic pathogen.</p><p>One crucial question is which protein is dragging the MJ backward during invasion? AMA1 does not possess the critical tryptophan that is necessary for interaction of its C-terminus with the sub-membranous motor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Jewett1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, during invasion, AMA-1 is present at the MJ but the majority of AMA1 is clearly on the parasite surface, on both sides of this adhesion zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Alexander1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Howell1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, implying that at least part of the AMA1 pool is not translocated posteriorly as opposed to other microneme proteins. Consistent with this notion, it is possible that part of the AMA1 pool serves as the anchor for the junction, but that another microneme TM protein interacts with the complex once assembled to propel it backwards in a glideosome-dependent motion.</p><p>Apicomplexan parasites show a wide range of host cell specificities that may depend on the expression of the MIC repertoire that differs greatly between parasites or stages of the same parasite; we hypothesize that the conserved process of invasion itself (i.e. MJ-dependent host cell entry) would be rather mediated by the specific protein complex described here, which is mostly conserved among Apicomplexa. However in this study we have characterized a new member of the MJ complex, RON8, which, in contrast to other MJ members, is specific to <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>N. caninum</italic>. This highlights the fact that the MJ complex could have a different composition in several Apicomplexa and would suggest that some MJ partners could also account for driving the specificity to the host cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Distinct timing of biosynthesis between MICs and RONs</title><p>The invasion by apicomplexan parasites is a well-orchestrated mechanism involving the targeting of interacting proteins from two distinct compartments. One intriguing question is how the micronemal protein AMA1 and the RONs complex, which move through a conventional eukaryotic secretory pathway involving the rough ER, the Golgi apparatus and endosome-like structures, avoid interacting before secretion. Here we showed that even if they could physically interact as pro-proteins in cell extracts, it is probably not the case in these intermediate compartments because of a distinct timing of biosynthesis between MICs and RONs. Indeed, all the RONs (in addition to the ROPs, data not shown) are present at the same time in the pre-rhoptries in dividing parasites, whereas newly-synthesized MIC3 and M2AP (their immature forms) are not yet detected in these parasites. They are synthesized later, when the rhoptry compartment has been fully loaded.</p><p>This is the first study showing unambiguously that MICs and RONs are not expressed at the same time, which indicates that the biogenesis of rhoptries and micronemes is asynchronous in <italic>T. gondii</italic>, as previously suggested by ultrastructural analysis of other Apicomplexa such as <italic>P. berghei</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000309-Schrevel1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. This distinct timing of biogenesis for proteins destined to two secretory organelles could be a general mechanism of segregation used by the parasite for interacting proteins, which would allow interaction only after secretion and during invasion.</p><p>In summary, this study extends significantly our understanding of the MJ formation and composition. The finely-tuned rhoptry and micronemal protein biosynthesis, the cooperation of these proteins originating from two different secretory organelles and the secretion of MJ components directly into the host cell, highlight the sophisticated strategies driving the active invasion of the Apicomplexa.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The primers, antibodies and recombinant proteins generated in this study are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000309.s008">Text S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Host cells and parasite cultures</title><p>All <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites were grown in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) or Vero cells grown in standard condition.
