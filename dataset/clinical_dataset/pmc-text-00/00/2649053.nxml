His vital signs including temperature, arterial pressure and heart rate were normal. Clinical examination was negative. A color Doppler exam&#x000e9;nation showed deep vein thrombosis and subsequently heparin therapy begun. Contrast Enchanced Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was also performed in order to exclude a major intra-abdominal malignancy and thrombosis of left external iliac vein was depicted as well. A history of migraine during the last 3 years and anorexia nervosa was also reported. After 10 days on heparin therapy, dry cough begun, followed by an episode of moderate haemoptysis (100&#x02013;120 ml). At review his vital signs were normal and his platelet count and coagulation tests were within normal limits. There was no leukocytosis, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal. Skin examination was normal. Chest postero-anterior plain film showed a nodular opacity in the mid right lung field. Chest Contrast Enchanced-Multislice CT (MSCT) and Magnetic Resonance angiography (MRA) revealed a partially thrombosed aneurysm of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery and left lower lobe pulmonary artery occlusion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Lung window settings of the MSCT revealed a right lower lobe ground glass opacity probably representing a pulmonary hemorrhage, while left lower lobe parenchyma appeared normal. MR brain venography showed chronic thrombosis of superior sagittal and transverse sinuses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Chest Contrast Enhanced-MSCT angiography axial section showing a partially thrombosed aneurysm of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery, and thrombosed segmental branch of the left lower lobe pulmonary artery</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1757-1626-2-98-1"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Contrast Enhanced pulmonary MRA (coronal MIP) showing aneurysm of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1757-1626-2-98-2"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Axial MIP of 3D-PC MRV showing chronic thrombosis of superior sagittal and transverse sinuses (arrows)</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1757-1626-2-98-3"/></fig><p>Finally, a diagnosis of Hughes-Stovin syndrome, was made on the basis of pulmonary artery aneurysms and venous thromboses in such a young patient, without clinical findings consistent with Beh&#x000e7;et disease. Even though our patient lacked a history of fever and chills, however dry cough, followed by haemoptysis due to pulmonary aneurysm and peripheral venous thrombosis without any clinical manifestations of Beh&#x000e7;et disease were strong evidence of Hughes-Stovin diagnosis. Haemoptysis resolved with intravenous methylprednisolone treatment after about 25 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Hughes-Stovin syndrome is a rare clinical condition characterized by multiple pulmonary artery aneurysms and peripheral venous thrombosis, first described in 1959 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Patients, mostly men aged 12&#x02013;40 years may present with haemoptysis, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and signs of pulmonary hypertension. Other associated features reported in Hughes-Stovin syndrome include fever and elevated intracranial hypertension Since its first description, there have been only a few reports of its occurrence in the English medical literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Aneurysms usually involve the pulmonary arteries and the bronchial arteries resulting in subsequent haemoptysis. However they can occur anywhere in systematic circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recurrent phlebitis also commonly involves the large vessels resulting in thrombus formation. In general there is a thrombus formation predisposition affecting the peripheral veins. Thrombosis of the vena cava and of the right atrium has also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Histologic studies show destruction of the arterial wall and perivascular lymphomonocytic infiltration of capillaries and venules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of Hughes-Stovin syndrome is not known. The current consensus opinion is that Hughes-Stovin syndrome results from a vasculitis similar to that implicated in Beh&#x000e7;et disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Vasculitis in Beh&#x000e7;et disease results in arterial occlusion, arterial aneurysm, venous occlusion, and varices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], indicating systemic vessel involvement. Furthermore, it is very likely that Hughes-Stovin syndrome represents a cardiovascular manifestation of Beh&#x000e7;et disease, since in both clinical entities pulmonary aneurysms are characteristic clinical features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However other clinical presentations can overlap significantly; both are more common in young men, the pulmonary manifestations of both can be identical, and the histology of the aneurysms in both entities can be similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Regardless the presence of deep venous thrombosis, the pulmonary artery thrombi may originate in situ, secondary to the pulmonary artery wall inflammation. On initial CT images a rim of enhancement at the filling defects may be depicted; this finding is consistent with inflammation &#x02013; a finding that is not usually seen in acute or chronic pulmonary embolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similarly, the pathogenesis of pulmonary artery aneurysms in Hughes-Stovin syndrome has been attributed to weakening of the vessel wall due to inflammation, which corresponds well to the observation by Ketchum et al, that the aneurysms develop at the locations of prior thrombus and abnormal enhancement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Hughes and Stovin's original theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] suggested that degenerative bronchial arteries lead to changes in the vasa vasorum of the pulmonary arteries and the development of aneurysms. The volume-rendered CT images according to Ketchum et al show prominent and tortuous bronchial artery branches that apparently supply a web of smaller vessels at the sites of pulmonary artery wall inflammation even before the actual aneurysm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similarly Mahlo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and Herb et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] performed digital subtraction angiography of the bronchial arteries and noted distorted and dilated bronchial arteries with convoluted small branches, findings that correspond to Hughes and Stovin's original theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Haemoptysis remains a leading cause of death in patients with Beh&#x000e7;et disease. Similarly, Hughes-Stovin syndrome is often fatal as a result of massive haemoptysis due to pulmonary/bronchial arterial aneurysm rupture. However systemic bronchial artery hypertrophy secondary to ischemia related to the pulmonary artery occlusion could also be the origin of bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Finally, haemoptysis could be attributed secondary to both pre-mentioned mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Conventional angiography can be used for better evaluation of the pulmonary aneurysms and assessment of angiodysplastic bronchial arteries in Hughes-Stovin syndrome.</p><p>However, it cannot be performed in all patients with venous thromboses. Contrast-Enhanced MRA and Contrast-Enhanced MDCTA may provide an alternative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] while 3D volume rendering analysis can ideally visualize the presence of an increased number of morphologically abnormal bronchial arteries even before aneurysm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In fact it is reported that multi-detector row helical CT angiography provides more precise depiction of bronchial and nonbronchial systemic arteries than does conventional angiography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The syndrome is most often treated by immunosuppressant, either systemic corticosteroids or cytotoxic agents (a combination of cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids), in patients without or with small amount of hemoptysis in order to stabilize the pulmonary artery aneurysms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], or even make them disappear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. If pulmonary embolism is present a therapeutic dilemma is often posed in using anticoagulants. Anticoagulation may prevent the progression of pulmonary embolism and resolve vein thrombi, but since it increases the risk and severity of haemoptysis, it is contraindicated. Surgical resection of the affected segments of the lung is to be considered in cases of high risk rupture aneurysms limited to one segment or one lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the high morbidity and mortality associated with surgery, and the frequent bilaterality and multifocality of the pulmonary artery aneurysms at the time of diagnosis, makes transcatheter embolization an alternative to surgery in most cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Identification of aneurysms in the bronchial arteries should be treated by bronchial artery embolization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Even enlargement of bronchial arteries when recognized, should be treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The types of vasculitis involved in Hughes-Stovin syndrome and in Beh&#x000e7;et disease seems to be very similar. Though most patients with Hughes-Stovin syndrome will present with haemoptysis and advanced disease, dysplastic bronchial arteries and pathologic enhancement of pulmonary thromboemboli seen on CT pulmonary angiograms should alert the radiologist and raise suspicion of pulmonary vasculitis. Earlier diagnosis could be in some cases crucial, allowing the prevention of the development of potentially life-threatening pulmonary artery aneurysms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.
