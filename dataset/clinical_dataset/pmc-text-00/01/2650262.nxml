INTRODUCTION</title><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) havebeen implicated in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, particularcardiac disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. ROS include a number of oxygen-containing reactivespecies, among which superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)are most widely studied in biomedical field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. ROS attack cellularconstitutes, including lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, leading to oxidativestress and tissue injury. Due to the detrimental effects of ROS, mammaliancells have evolved a number of antioxidants to protect cells from oxidativeinjury. However, under pathophysiological conditions, ROS formation mayoverwhelm the normal cellular antioxidant defenses, and as such oxidativetissue injury and disease process occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>There are a number of cellularsources of ROS formation, which include mitochondrial electron transport chain(ETC), NAD(P)H oxidase, uncoupled nitric oxide synthases, and cytochrome P450enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The above cellular sources of ROS formation are implicated inoxidative stress of various tissues, including vasculature and myocardium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Because of the multiple cellular component nature of mammalian tissues,detection of cell-specific formation of ROS is of critical importance forunderstanding the oxidative mechanisms of disease process and for developingantioxidative stress-based strategies for intervention of oxidative tissuedegeneration. In this context, over the last several decades various methodshave been developed for detecting ROS formation in biological systems. Theseinclude the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping, luminescentmethods, as well as a number of biochemical assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. While EPR spintrapping technique is of the highest specificity for detecting oxygen radicals,its sensitivity is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, EPR technique and most of thebiochemical assays for detecting ROS are unable to directly visualize the ROS formationin a highly sensitive real-time manner. Direct sensitive in situ detection ofROS formation from cultured cells provides important insight into the molecularand biochemical mechanisms by which ROS mediate pathophysiological processes. Accordingly, in this study, we have applied the highly sensitivechemiluminescence (CL) imaging technique to investigate the in situ ROSformation in cultured monolayers of rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes and the factorsthat modulate the ROS generation in this widely used in vitro model for cardiaccell physiology and pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

In situ real-time CL imaging</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, a liquidnitrogen cooled back-illuminated charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (VersArray2048B, Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ, USA) with a Nikon 50 mm f/1.2 lenswas used to image the 6-well cell culture plates.

To reduce the noise, the CCD sensor was cooled to  &#x02212;110&#x000b0;C,  and a 50 kHz read outfrequency was used to minimize the dark current and read out noise. The cultureplates were placed on a heated plate (37&#x000b0;C). An enhanced aluminum front mirrorwas placed above the culture plates to redirect the photons to the camera. Toensure that the imaging experiment environment is totally dark, the imagingsystem is placed in a light tight enclosure. After placing the cultureplates in the imaging system, we immediately took 6 CL images, each with tenminutes of exposure time.</p><p>Before we extracted out the data, wecalibrated the intensity of the CCD sensor by using dark frames to remove thebackground and thermal noise in a totally dark environment.

For each CL image, we subtracted the master dark frame from it to get the finalimage.

Induction of cellular antioxidants by D3T andthe effects on basal and BPQ-stimulated ROSformation in cultured monolayers of H9c2 cells</title><p>Asshown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, incubation of H9c2 cells with 100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>MD3T for 48 hours resulted in significant induction of cellular NQO1, CAT, GSH,GR, and GPx.

DISCUSSION</title><p>AlthoughROS have been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac disorders,studies on direct in situ CL imaging of ROS formation in cultured cardiac cellsare lacking in the literature. In this study, we have applied a highlysensitive CL imaging system (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) to investigate the in situ real-timeROS formation in cultured monolayers of rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes, a widely usedin vitro cell model for studying cardiac cell biology and cytoprotection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">14</xref>]. By using this innovative CL imaging system, we have demonstrated thatsignificant amounts of ROS could be released from H9c2 cells in culture underunstimulated conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While the exact cellular sources forthis constitutive ROS formation in H9c2 cells remain to be elucidated, onepossible site could be the mitochondrial ETC. In this regard, mitochondria accountfor roughly 40&#x02013;50% of the totalmass of cardiomyocytes. Considering the high mitochondrial activity incardiomyocytes, we next determined if BPQ could stimulate the ROS formationfrom H9c2 cells in culture. Indeed, dramatically augmented CL responses were observed after adding 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M, and even 0.2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M BPQ to the cultured monolayers of H9c2 cells (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), suggesting that BPQ is a potent ROS generator in cardiomyocytes. Itremains unclear why the CL responses elicited by 0.2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>MBPQ decreased over 60 minutes in untreated cell cultures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Itmight be due to the significant detoxification of the small amount of BPQ (0.4 nmol/2.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells) in H9c2 cells, leading to decreased availability of the free BPQmolecules that undergo redox cycling to produce ROS.</p><p>BPQ is a quinone metabolite derivedfrom benzo(a)pyrene, an environmental pollutant implicated in cardiovasculardiseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">16</xref>]. Benzo(a)pyrene is also present in cigarette smoking, which isa major risk factor for human cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">17</xref>]. Metabolism ofbenzo(a)pyrene by mammalian tissues, including cardiovascular tissue, can formsignificant amounts of BPQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">18</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that BPQpreferentially undergoes redox cycling in mitochondria, leading to ROSformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, unpublished observation]. Thus, the mitochondrial ETC could also be the site where BPQ underwentredox cycling to generate ROS in the cultured monolayers of H9c2 cells. Tofurther investigate the involvement of mitochondrial ETC in ROS formation byH9c2 cells, AA and ROT were used to selectively block the electron transport atcomplexes I and III, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">19</xref>]. The marginal effects of either AA orROS on ROS formation by H9c2 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggested that blocking the mitochondrialETC was not an effective mechanism for altering ROS formation by H9c2 cells. The redox cycling of BPQ thus appears to be a much more effective pathway foraugmentation of ROS formation by cardiomyocytes. This is an importantobservation considering the involvement of benzo(a)pyrene in cardiovasculardiseases. The potent and sustained stimulation of ROS formation by BPQ incardiomyocytes would create significant oxidative stress in myocardium. In thiscontext, augmented ROS formation and the subsequent oxidative cell injury inmyocardium are crucial events underlying cardiac disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Likewise,inhibition or scavenging of ROS in myocardium has been shown to be an effectivestrategy for intervention of oxidative cardiac injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">21</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we alsodemonstrated that pretreatment with D3T significantly upregulated cellular antioxidantsand markedly inhibited both constitutive and BPQ-stimulated ROS formation incultured monolayers of H9c2 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). D3T is a cruciferoussulfur-containing compound, which potently induces antioxidants in mammaliancells/tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">22</xref>]. In H9c2 cells, D3T potently upregulated NQO1, CAT, GSH, GR,and GPX (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). NOQ1 is recently found to scavenge superoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">23</xref>]. CAT, GSH, GR, and GPx are key cellular factors primarily for detoxification of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>, coordinatedinduction of the above cellular antioxidants in H9c2 cells would enhancedetoxification of both superoxide and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,  and therebyleading to the decreases in luminol/HRP-amplified CL responses. This is thefirst study demonstrating that upregulation of cellular antioxidants by D3T wasaccompanied by markedly decreased oxidative stress induced by BPQ in culturedcardiomyocytes. The above finding also implicated D3T as a promisingchemoprotective nutraceutical for intervention of oxidative cardiac injuryassociated with exposure to benzo(a)pyrene as well as other pollutants thatgive rise to redox-cyclingquinones. In this regard, consumption of cruciferous vegetables rich inorganosulfur compounds, including dithiolethiones, is associated with decreased incidence ofcardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">25</xref>].</p><p>In summary, by using the highlysensitive CL imaging system, we demonstrate that cultured monolayers of H9c2cardiomyocytes constitutively release ROS under physiological conditions, andthe redox cyclerBPQ potently stimulates the ROS formation in the cultured cardiomyocytes. Withthis innovative imaging system, we also demonstrate that upregulation ofcellular antioxidants by cruciferous D3T appears to be a highly effectivestrategy for mitigating oxidative stress induced by BPQ in the culturedcardiomyocytes. These observations lay a basis for investigation of myocardialoxidative stress as well as cardioprotection in animal models. Although most ofthe data presented in this work were from 2 independent measurements, ourongoing research on luminol/HRP-based CL imaging further confirms the abilityof this innovative technique toreproducibly detect ROS in both cellular systems and in vivo animals.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>ABBREVIATIONS</title><def-list><def-item><term>AA:</term><def><p>Antimycin A</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BPQ:</term><def><p>Benzo(a)pyrene-1,6-quinone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAT:</term><def><p> Catalase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CL:</term><def><p>Chemiluminescence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>D3T:</term><def><p>3<italic>H</italic>-1,2-dithiole-3-thione</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DCIP:</term><def><p>Dichloroindophenol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPR:</term><def><p> Electronparamagnetic resonance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ETC:</term><def><p> Electrontransport chain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FBS:</term><def><p> Fetalbovine serum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GPx:</term><def><p> Glutathioneperoxidase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GR:</term><def><p> Glutathionereductase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GSH:</term><def><p>Reducedform of glutathione</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>:</term><def><p>Hydrogen peroxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRP:</term><def><p> Horseradish peroxidase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NQO1:</term><def><p> NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBS:</term><def><p> Phosphate buffered saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROS:</term><def><p> Reactiveoxygen species</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ROT:</term><def><p> Rotenone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOD:</term><def><p>Superoxide dismutase.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by NIHR01HL71190 and a grant from Harvey Peters Research Center Foundation to Y.
