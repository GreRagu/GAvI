It is the third greatest cause of respiratory death in the United Kingdom with older people increasingly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-copd-3-791">British Thoracic Society 2006</xref>). Patients suffer impairment in health related quality of life (HRQL) distressing dyspnoea and reduced exercise capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-copd-3-791">National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions. 2004</xref>). COPD accounts for 20% of all respiratory related emergency admissions to English hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-copd-3-791">British Thoracic Society 2006</xref>). Chronic diseases such as COPD require a holistic approach to management, and importantly a strong focus on the facilitation and support of behaviors that enable self-management. Pulmonary rehabilitation, a multidisciplinary intervention consisting of exercise, psycho-social support and education aims to &#x0201c;reduce the symptoms, disability, and handicap and to improve functional independence in people with lung disease&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-copd-3-791">Morgan et al 2001</xref>). In addition to this pulmonary rehabilitation encourages a commitment to long term exercise behaviors and promotes self-management strategies.</p><p>Self efficacy is a psychological construct which defines &#x0201c;the belief in one&#x02019;s capabilities to organise and execute the course of action required to produce given attainments&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-copd-3-791">Bandura 1997</xref>), and may be fundamental to promoting effective self management and enabling behavior change in the longer term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-copd-3-791">Jones 2006</xref>). In one study of healthy older subjects, self efficacy was shown to be influential in an individual&#x02019;s decision concerning participation in a home-based strengthening programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-copd-3-791">Bawel 2003</xref>). It has been suggested that self-efficacy acts as the mediator between changes in health related quality of life, symptoms and physiological outcomes in patients with COPD after pulmonary rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-copd-3-791">Arnold et al 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-3-791">Kohler 2002</xref>). In support of this, change in exercise tolerance after rehabilitation has been shown to be associated with improvements in self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-copd-3-791">Lox and Freehill 1999</xref>). In this case the self-efficacy measurement was designed to test an individual&#x02019;s confidence to perform selected activities as extolled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-copd-3-791">Bandura (1997)</xref>. Participants were asked to rate perceived confidence to achieve pre-defined walking distances.The authors demonstrated that stronger self-efficacy for walking at the start of the programme was associated with a greater increase in walking distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-copd-3-791">Lox and Freehill 1999</xref>). This suggests a role for confidence and perceived ability in achieving change. In another study of individuals with COPD the authors evaluated relationships between self-efficacy, dyspnoea and functional ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-copd-3-791">Siela 2003</xref>). Using the COPD Self Efficacy Scale (CSES) significant relationships between the variables were identified. Self-efficacy accounted for one third of the variance in functional ability in men with COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-copd-3-791">Siela 2003</xref>). The CSES was developed specifically for COPD and has shown good test-retest reliability and internal consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-copd-3-791">Wigal et al 1991</xref>) although to date the scale has received little attention in the evaluation of pulmonary rehabilitation.</p><p>Goal setting is commonplace in many programmes, and often considered to be &#x0201c;the cornerstone of effective rehabilitation&#x0201c; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-copd-3-791">Barnes and Ward 2000</xref>). Effective goal setting and attainment of goals is generally thought to be associated with increased confidence in self-management skills, for example the ability to manage symptoms and self-exercise. The precise value and effectiveness of methods of goal setting has, however been poorly evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-3-791">Levack et al 2006</xref>) and factors that determine those who achieve goals compared with those who do not requires greater exploration. One study using &#x02018;goals achieved&#x02019; as a measurement of success identified significant differences in the assessment of goal attainment between therapists and patients. Therapists were more likely to underestimate goal attainment compared with patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-copd-3-791">van Stel et al 2002</xref>). We may hypothesise that self-efficacy will determine whether a patient develops the necessary behaviors to achieve a particular goal. The aims of this study therefore are to investigate the influence of initial levels of self-efficacy on patient reported goal achievement and the effect of rehabilitation on self efficacy. In addition, we will explore relationships between self efficacy and other rehabilitation outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In this longitudinal follow up study, patients were recruited from primary and secondary care services as part of a study of pulmonary rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-3-791">Garrod et al 2006</xref>). One hundred and eleven patients with a known diagnosis of COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-copd-3-791">The COPD Guidelines Group of the Standards of Care Committee of the British Thoracic Society 1999</xref>) were sent invitation letters outlining the rehabilitation programme on offer and the nature of the research. Of those who responded, 16 declined to participate and 87 made initial assessment appointments. Seventy-four of these patients attended initial assessment (missing CSES data for 2 patients). All provided written informed consent. All patients had limited exercise tolerance due to dyspnoea. No patient had performed rehabilitation in the past 12 months. Taxi transport to the hospital was provided where required. Exclusion criteria consisted of unstable angina, recent exacerbation or change of medication, intermittent claudication or other mobility limiting conditions. Full ethical consent was obtained from Wandsworth Local Research Ethics Committee.</p><sec><title>Baseline assessments</title><p>Patient details (age, gender, smoking history) and lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC) were assessed prior to rehabilitation using a Sensormatics<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Vmax 29c.</p></sec><sec><title>Goal setting</title><p>Goal setting was performed prior to rehabilitation with the assistance of the physiotherapist.

This 34 item questionnaire has been shown to be both reliable and internally consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-copd-3-791">Wigal et al 1991</xref>). Participants are asked to identify how confident they are that they could manage their breathing difficulties in a number of situations, for instance &#x0201c;when there is humidity in the air&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;when I am lying in bed&#x0201d;. The CSES provides items with sufficient complexity in relation to the specific situation of managing with COPD. The CSES consists of Likert scale with 5 responses from &#x0201c;very confident&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;not at all confident&#x0201d; scoring 5 to 1 with 5 representing higher self-efficacy. The score can be calculated in two ways, a raw score with a maximum of 170, or a rating score which takes account of items that may not be applicable to the patient by reporting the average score based on the number of items answered. Since, in some cases, items were considered non applicable, we only report on the rating score data in this analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><sec><title>Sub-maximal exercise tolerance</title><p>The Six Minute Walking Distance (6MWD) was performed according to ATS instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-3-791">ATS 2002</xref>) along a 30 m corridor and the best of 2 repeatable tests were taken (repeatability was defined as a difference between walks of &#x0003c;50 m).

Education, self management strategies and goal setting (as components of rehabilitation) may be considered integral to this process. However the efficacy of methods of goal setting has not been clearly determined. Goal setting and problem solving may be considered an essential source of self-efficacy beliefs and relies on an individual&#x02019;s cognitive appraisal of the situation and effort to persist in the face of any setbacks. The findings of this study did not support our hypothesis, that individuals with strong self-efficacy would be more successful in overcoming difficulties in order to achieve their goals. In our analysis all goals were considered and classed as &#x0201c;attained&#x0201d; if at least one goal was fully achieved according to the patient&#x02019;s perspective. If data were analysed considering the primary goal only we see a trend emerging towards higher self efficacy associated with goal attainment (p = 0.05). However, rehabilitation is a multifaceted therapy with the aim of achieving a number of goals relevant to patients&#x02019; daily life, to this end we felt an aggregated measure would better reflect the complexity of rehabilitation and goal setting. It is however, reassuring that most of the patients reported some level of achievement of goals, hence supporting the notion that pulmonary rehabilitation is a patient focused treatment with outcomes directly applicable to patient goals.</p><p>The concept of goal setting remains poorly defined, not only do approaches differ between health professionals but individual concepts of goal setting and perception of attainment also differ. This makes standardization of goal setting difficult, however, we ensured that only one health professional was involved with the goal setting and that patients used a standardized method to record outcome, from their own perspective. Although goals necessarily differed according to patient preference we endeavored to ensure that they were measurable to some extent, eg, by distance walked, activity achieved, effort involved. The goals identified were predominantly related to functional ability suggesting there may have been (albeit unwitting) therapist bias. Further studies exploring the concept of goal setting in patients with COPD are recommended. In particular, the effect of supervision and the influence of different health professionals require further elucidation. The most appropriate way of measuring and assessing goals has yet to be determined and warrants further research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-3-791">Levack et al 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study we provide further validation of the CSES questionnaire through evidence of relationships with other measures of patient symptoms. Self-efficacy both influences whether an individual will attempt an action as well as determining whether they will persevere in overcoming obstacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-copd-3-791">Bandura 1997</xref>). Self-efficacy beliefs have been found to predict significant variation in rehabilitation outcome following orthopedic surgery (after controlling for physical functioning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-copd-3-791">Waldrop et al 2001</xref>), level of disability from pain intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-copd-3-791">Arnstein et al 1999</xref>) and recovery from heart attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-3-791">Ewart 1992</xref>).</p><p>A criticism of our study concerns the large number of subjects lost to follow-up. Of the initial 87 patients who made an appointment for assessment only 74 attended and CSES data were unavailable for 2 of those. Forty-eight patients completed rehabilitation and all assessments. Although self-efficacy at baseline did not differ between those who completed rehabilitation and those who dropped out we cannot account for differences in motivation nor do our analyses allow us to explore other psychological influences such as anxiety or depression that might contribute to goal attainment. However, whether baseline self efficacy influences goal attainment in a self selected (and presumably well motivated group of patients) remains a pertinent question.</p><p>In accordance with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-copd-3-791">Arnold et al 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-copd-3-791">Lox and Freehill 1999</xref>), we showed a statistically significant difference in self-efficacy after rehabilitation, further supporting sensitivity of the CSES in the evaluation of rehabilitation. In the study of Arnold et al (1999) a generic self-efficacy tool was used and unlike the CSES test re-test reliability has not been documented.</p><p>The attainment of a personal goal can act as a powerful reinforcement of successful self-management, and could lead to a more positive appraisal of performance. Recent qualitative data shows that, in patients with Bronchiectasis, one of the perceived barriers to self management includes lack of confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-3-791">Lavery et al 2007</xref>). Understanding more about the components and facilitators of goal attainment in rehabilitation may help us identify strategies that will support longer term behavior change and maintenance of rehabilitation benefits.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge the support of The Health Foundation in funding this work and the statistical support of Dr Penelope Bidgood.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>RG has received funding from GlaxoSmithKline, Boehringer and Pfizer.
