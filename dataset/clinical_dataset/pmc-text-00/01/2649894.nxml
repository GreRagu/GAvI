Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), sustains proliferation and not differentiation of embryonic stem cells. We used CD133 to purify adult human retinal cells and aimed to determine what effect LIF had on these cultures and whether they still had the ability to generate neurospheres.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Retinal cell suspensions were derived from adult human post-mortem tissue with ethical approval. With magnetic automated cell sorting (MACS) CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells were enriched from post mortem adult human retina. CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cell phenotype was analysed by flow cytometry and cultured cells were observed for proliferative capacity, neuropshere generation and differentiation with or without LIF supplementation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We demonstrated purification (to 95%) of CD133<sup>+ </sup>cells from adult human postmortem retina. Proliferating cells were identified through BrdU incorporation and expression of the proliferation markers Ki67 and Cyclin D1. CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells differentiated whilst forming neurospheres containing appropriate lineage markers including glia, neurons and photoreceptors. LIF maintained CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells in a proliferative and relatively undifferentiated state (Ki67, Cyclin D1 expression) without significant neurosphere generation. Differentiation whilst forming neurospheres was re-established on LIF withdrawal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data support the evidence that CD133 expression characterises a population of cells within the resident adult human retina which have progenitor cell properties and that their turnover and differentiation is influenced by LIF. This may explain differences in retinal responses observed following disease or injury.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Neurospheres can be reliably generated from post-mortem adult human retina irrespective of post-mortem time (up to 48 hours) or age of donor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This implies that the adult human retina may possess an inherent ability for cellular replacement throughout life. To this aim we have a presence of somatic progenitor cells, within adult human tissue, which unlike stem cell populations previously described for the retina, have limited potential but are responsible for cell renewal via differentiation into mature functioning cells. Progenitor cells divide rarely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] but are likely to be stimulated to proliferate in the event of tissue damage due to disease or injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These progenitor cells are thought to differ from stem cells in that their proliferation is most likely asymmetric i.e. where some cells retain the properties of the parent cell and some begin the process of differentiation into mature cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The progenitor cells that we are studying within the retina are observed to have a reduced proliferation rate and generate neurospheres containing cells at different stages of differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This cannot be compared to the hallmarks of stem cells which have a high rate logarithmic expansion of totipotent cells usually associated with embryonic tissue but more recently identified within adult neural tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Cell-cell, cell-matrix, cognate and soluble growth factor and cytokine-mediated regulation of cell may maintain retinal progenitor cells in an arrested or quiescent state with very low turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In order to therapeutically support or facilitate progenitor cells roles in regeneration of adult retina following inflammation, degeneration or damage, further understanding of the control of cell turnover is required. The isolation or enrichment of this population of cells is therefore an important objective for this avenue of research. To date a few cell markers have proved suitable for specifically identifying, isolating or enriching progenitor cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A common marker for neural tissue progenitors is the cell surface expression of CD133 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. CD133 is a pentaspan glycoprotein expressed in the plasma membrane protrusions of cells, first identified on mouse neuroepithelial stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In humans CD133 identifies haemopoietic stem and progenitor cells that may also express the stem cell marker CD34 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although the function of CD133 in stem/progenitor cells is unknown, it is expressed in a wide range of tissues throughout the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Within the retina CD133, human prominin (mouse)-like 1 (PROML1, previously known as AC133 antigen) is concentrated in the membrane evaginations at the base of rod photoreceptor cell outer segments, (from where photoreceptor discs are formed) and in the absence of retinal prominin 1/CD133, photoreceptor degeneration occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. CD133 expression in undifferentiated cells has been utilised to identify, isolate and enrich stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and neural progenitor from the developing and adult brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In these systems CD133<sup>+ </sup>progenitor cells generated primary and secondary neurospheres (demonstrating potential for passage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore CD133<sup>+ </sup>cell populations showed potent engraftment, proliferation, migration, and neural differentiation ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Following injury or damage, neural tissue responds with production of growth factor, neutrotrophins and cytokines including the mitogen, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF is a member of the IL-6 cytokine family that maintains stem cells in an undifferentiated state and promotes stem cell renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the adult rodent brain, LIF is localised to neurons within the olfactory sensory layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and is upregulated in injury or tissue damage enhancing neural progenitor cell turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. LIF signals via gp130, (associated with LIF receptor) driving progenitor cells to re-enter the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although LIF maintains neural stem cell turnover observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, exogenous LIF promotes gliogenesis alongside enhanced neurosphere production <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The actions of LIF may therefore vary in different contexts.</p><p>The data presented demonstrate successful purification of adult human progenitor cells through magnetic separation using the stem cell marker CD133. Purified cultures were assessed in the presence of growth factors and cytokines (FGF2 and LIF) for proliferative ability (markers of division), neurosphere generation and cell differentiation and phenotype. The role of exogenous LIF in maintaining retinal progenitor cells in culture (preventing neurosphere generation and differentiation) was also addressed. CD133<sup>+</sup>retinal cells showed increased proliferation in the presence of LIF as measured by BrdU incorporation, Ki67 and Cyclin D1 expression. CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells were efficient in forming neurospheres, which was suppressed in the presence of LIF and restored again by LIF removal, without any demonstrable change in their differentiation capacity within neurospheres.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of tissue</title><p>Research on human retinal tissue was carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Donor tissue was obtained from Bristol Eye Bank after the removal of the cornea for transplant was used with research consent and ethical approval (Central and South Bristol Research and Ethics project number E5866) and R and D approval (United Bristol Healthcare project number OP/2004/1734). As previously reported, the retina was removed from donor eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Post mortem times varied between 20 and 48 hours which does not alter the ability of progenitor cell cultures to generate neurospheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry of retinal sections</title><p>Whole neural retina was removed from donor eyes and washed in cell culture medium to remove any contaminating retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 2 hours at room temperature.

Within the retina, CD133<sup>+ </sup>cells are subject to a complex microenvironment, which is likely to act through cytokines such as LIF and IL-6 and undoubtedly other mitogens that may regulate the mitotic activity and differentitation of these cells into mature cell types. Through the incorporation of BrdU we have shown that CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells do give rise to daughter cells that have low level proliferative capacity forming neurospheres that contain subset of cells that retain multipotency, expressing retinal cell markers including glial, neurons and photoreceptors.</p><p>Although our research focuses on CD133<sup>+ </sup>cells within the retina, the exact origin of these cells remains an open question. Retinal progenitor cells may be derived from marrow progenitors, via the circulation (through retinal vessels, choroidal vessels and crossing Bruch's membrane or anterior eye structures); arise from a tissue specific population within the eye (or optic nerve) or arise from changes in other cells e.g. M&#x000fc;ller glial or endothelial progenitor cells. The network of elongated Nestin<sup>+ </sup>cells within the retina would support the distribution of migrating progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] but does not in itself help with the understanding of the origin of retinal progenitors, unless these cells themselves are the progenitors. Retinal stem cells migrate much more widely through the eye if injected into the vitreous than if injected under the retina however transplanted neural progenitor cells exhibit widespread migration into diseased retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Other groups have identified progenitor cells within the ciliary body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>],, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], peripheral margin of the postnatal retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], iris pigment epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and some suggest that M&#x000fc;ller glial cells within the adult retina possess progenitor like properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. We did not detect any markers on CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells to suggest that they were M&#x000fc;ller Glial cells. Their lack of significant expression of haemopoeitic stem cell markers (CD34, CD117, ABCG2, CD45) may suggest that these cells are unlikely to have migrated from bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>The use of CD133 in purifying progenitor cells from both embryonic (murine and human) and adult brain (murine) is established and recognised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The current data demonstrate that the same is true for human retinal progenitor cells. Primary cell suspensions from adult human retina generate more neurospheres per viable cells after selecting for CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells. This suggests that retinal progenitors may have similarity to those from embryonic brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. The data presented demonstrate that a population of CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells have a greater capacity to generate neurospheres (a behaviour associated with differentiation of cells). Correspondingly FACS analysis revealed BrdU incorporation within CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells when incubated with FGF/N2, supporting the hypothesis that increases in overall cell numbers in cultures arise from newly generated cells.</p><p>The analysis of markers expressed by CD133<sup>+ </sup>enriched retinal cells is consistent with a progenitor cell phenotype and is similar to other progenitor cells within the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. As expected CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells highly express Nestin, a neural progenitor cell marker expressed within human retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], but in addition, there was a high expression of CD90, the neural receptor CD271, the neural adhesion marker NCAM, PAX-6 and the FIk2/Fit3 tyrosine kinase receptor CD135. PAX-6 is an important marker as it has a multifunctional role which includes regulating proliferation and differentiation through controlling expression of downstream molecules which contributes to the multipotency of retinal progenitor cells. Pax-6 influences the expression of the following transcription factors which ultimately leads to the generation of specific cell types; Math5, ganglion cells; NgN2, bipolar cells; Neuro D, amacrine cells; Crx1, photoreceptors; Rx1, muller glial cells and Pax-6 acts directly for horizontal cells and is essential for lens formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that Pax-6 is also important for neurosphere generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. In these studies the Pax-6 gene deletion led to arrested retinal development and when cells from the optic nerve of these embryos were harvested, retinal neurospheres failed to develop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. This generates a significant role of Pax-6 in the competence of retinal stem cells and not just retinal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. We provide the first description of retinal expression of CD135 on CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells, which has previously only be found to be expressed in fetal and adult brain, testis and the placenta. It is expressed in populations enriched for stem cells and primitive uncommitted progenitors including haemopoietic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] and is currently being used as a tool for expanding stem cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. The low and absent expression of the cells markers rhodopsin, GFAP, CD45, CD31, CRALBP and CD31 confirm that CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells alongside proliferation markers, are at least as subgroups not differentiated photoreceptors, glial, endothelial or immune cells.</p><p>The CD133 enrichment of adult human retinal cells convincingly enriches retinal neural progenitor cells. In support of this we noted that CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells upregulate their expression of Notch-1 when incubated with LIF which suggests that LIF would be expected to preserve undifferentiated progenitor cells in this system. An upregulation of Notch-1 is critical in the signalling pathway that preserves a pool of undifferentiated progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Low or absent levels of Notch-1 permit cells to exit the cell cycle and ultimately differentiate. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Furthermore increased Notch-1 expression was accompanied by an upregulation of CD135 which as previously discussed, is also important for stem cell turnover. It is therefore not surprising that the cell cycle proliferation markers Ki67 and Cyclin D1 are also upregulated following LIF incubation. Cyclin D1 is more closely associated with promoting photoreceptor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Conversely both Pax-6 and Nestin are upregulated following incubation with FGF/N2, which seems to support the development of neurospheres and differentiated cells in our culture systems. These findings are consistent with current research on progenitor cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] As Pax-6 levels increase, progenitor cells leave the cell cycle and reach a pre-differentiated state before switching off and terminally differentiating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Low levels of Pax-6 function to maintain progenitor cells within the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] which is in agreement with the lower expression found on CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells at time 0 and following LIF incubation. The increased expression of Nestin in FGF/N2 is not that surprising as this is where we see optimal neurosphere generation. The intermediate filament, Nestin has a structure which allows conformational change and as cellular differentiation is associated with morphological changes, following exposure to extracellular as well as cellular signals (such as those associated with the cell cycle), Nestin responds accordingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. In our results we also saw an upregulation of DBX following incubation with FGF/N2. DBX is a microtubule protein which is generally expressed in migrating neuronal processes and more recently has been identified as a marker for neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Within our studies DBX expression could represent the presence of neuron generation and add more scope to the identity of CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells as multipotential progenitors.</p><p>In the central nervous system LIF is involved in responses to injury where expression of LIF increases following brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] with enhanced cell turnover and ensuing cell death and replacement in the damaged area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Studies on LIF-mediated control of embryonic stem cells have suggested that self-renewal of cells involves an auto-regulatory loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In low concentrations of LIF, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. ESCs were found to commit to cell differentiation within the first 36 hours of LIF deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Low levels of LIF maintain cells in a non-responsive state due to endogenous STAT3 activity and once cells have lost STAT3 activity; LIF responsiveness is also lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus cells that have lost LIF-responsiveness are committed to differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and this would reflect the findings in our culture system as when LIF is not added exogenously neurospheres are generated. In addition the lack of NANOG expression within our CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells suggests the need for LIF in order to self renew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. NANOG alleviates the necessity for LIF in ESC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. We found that CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells respond to LIF and respond in the manner expected of ESCs and progenitors described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. So when CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells were cultured in the presence of exogenous LIF; neurosphere generation was reduced. The suppression of neurosphere formation in the presence of LIF raises the question as to whether, like other neural progenitor cells, it may be possible to expand isolated retinal progenitor cells <italic>ex vivo</italic>. A question we hope to address fully in future work.</p><p>Despite our observed effect of exogenous LIF on CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells, neurospheres generated within the optimum growth condition FGF/N2 occurred in the presence of low levels of endogenous LIF. The low levels of LIF at 48 hours increased to significant levels at 2 weeks. For ESCs, LIF concentration is converted into an all or nothing response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Applying this mechanism to CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells the level of endogenously generated LIF may initially have been below the threshold to change the fate of CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells, thus neurosphere generation ensued. Neurosphere differentiation could not be reversed when LIF was re-introduced (unpublished observations) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and we do not have any evidence as to which cells generate LIF in our cultures.</p><p>Studies of embryonic neural precursor cells found that prior exposure to LIF enhances the generation of neurospheres in the presence of appropriate growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Ability to generate neurospheres from purified CD133<sup>+ </sup>adult human retinal cell suspensions was regained after LIF removal but did not fully recover to the extent seen in cells never exposed to LIF, where neurospheres were generated from CD133<sup>+ </sup>cells in FGF/N2 alone. The reason remains unknown but may relate to the rate of cell turnover (which is low for adult human-derived cells). Different stem/progenitor cells have different rates of turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]; faster turnover is observed with embryonic tissue and tissue from small species, where there is a high index of cell division and cell death in differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. Conversely stem cells that turnover slowly and thus divide infrequently generate long lived differentiated cells; a trait arguably favourable within adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Pre-exposure to LIF did influence the size of neurospheres generated; so that they contained significantly more nuclei than neurospheres simply cultured in FGF2/N2. This was also found when neurospheres were generated from neural progenitor cells of postnatal rats that were exposed to LIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. So although the reason for this is unclear it is not a unique observation. Autoregulation of LIF levels through STAT3 could have allowed some CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells to remain in an arrested progenitor state. Such cells could still respond to LIF signalling but reducing the overall neurosphere numbers as fewer cells have committed to differentiation? After pre-exposure to LIF, cell types within neurospheres generated were not different from those neurospheres generated in FGF/N2 Therefore LIF exposure did not detectably alter cell fate or potential. Neurospheres contained neurons, glial and photoreceptor cells. Although evidence suggests that LIF enhances self-renewal by driving a more glial phenotype in differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>], we did not observe this in our cultures as relative numbers of GFAP<sup>+ </sup>cells were not increased.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results provide more evidence for the inherent regenerative ability of the adult human retina. Through purification of a CD133<sup>+ </sup>cell population we have demonstrated that the adult human retina possess cells which can proliferate and whose phenotypic profile after LIF exposure is suggestive of progenitor cell status. The similarity of CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells with other progenitor populations suggests common themes in the behaviour of progenitor cells from different sources. Emerging evidence (paper in preparation) from human retinal neural progenitor cells suggests that they respond to other members of this cytokine family (which includes LIF, IL-6, CNTF and others). LIF and IL-6 share a common signalling mechanism activating gp130 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. This makes the study of the transcriptional targets of LIF/STAT3 an important area of future study in CD133<sup>+ </sup>purified adult human retinal progenitors and suggests a role for LIF in expansion of these cells. However more understanding is needed in the control of what maintains the regenerative ability of cells within the retina and the signals that decide which cells proliferate and which differentiate. Several signalling pathways have been suggested including the Oct-4, Wnt/b-catenin, Notch, BMP (bone morphogenic protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>] and sonic hedgehog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Further work into this area which, will include in depth analysis of microarray data generated for CD133<sup>+ </sup>retinal cells (GEO GSE14733) corroborated by quantitative PCR analysis, will enable us to understand how disease modifying treatments can be developed to target these progenitor cells and possible ex-vivo expansion of retinal progenitor cells for transplantation within the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. We will assess gene expression within the CD133<sup>+ </sup>population over time when exposed to mitogens (including BMPR, noggin, sonic hedgehog and jagged-1). The data produced will generate further understanding of the control of these cells within the neural retina.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DAC carried out, participated in the design and study of the experimental procedures and drafted the manuscript.
