Thus, a physically active lifestyle inevitably results in a larger decrease of daily energy expenditure at later age than a sedentary lifestyle. Here, longitudinal measurements were performed to observe the consequence of the age-associated reduction in physical activity for the maintenance of energy balance as reflected in the fat store of the body.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Healthy, non-obese adults (17 women and 23 men; 27&#x000b1;5 yr; 22.8&#x000b1;2.0 kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) participated in the study. All subjects gave written informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Maastricht University Medical Centre. Follow-up measurements were performed after 11&#x000b1;4 (range 6&#x02013;16) yr. Total energy expenditure was measured by monitoring their metabolism with doubly labeled water over a two-week period, the optimal observation interval for the biological half-lives of the isotopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004745-Speakman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The physical activity level (PAL) is defined as the factor by which total energy expenditure exceeds resting energy expenditure, measured in the early morning with indirect calorimetry. All initial measurements and follow-up measurements in 22 subjects were performed with doubly labeled water. Additionally, all follow-up measurements of PAL, including the remaining 18 subjects, were performed over the same period with a doubly labeled water validated triaxial accelerometer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004745-Plasqui1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Body fat was assessed with deuterium dilution.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Body mass index, as a general indicator of body fatness, increased from 22.8&#x000b1;2.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at baseline to 24.3&#x000b1;2.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at follow-up (P&#x0003c;0.01, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004745-t001">Table 1</xref>). Total energy expenditure showed a non-significant decrease and resting energy expenditure showed a non-significant increase, in combination resulting in a significant decrease of activity energy expenditure from 4.21&#x000b1;1.05 MJ/d to 3.92&#x000b1;1.19 MJ/d (P&#x0003c;0.05). The PAL value decreased significantly (P&#x0003c;0.01) from 1.81&#x000b1;0.16 (range 1.51&#x02013;2.15) to 1.75&#x000b1;0.11 (range 1.58&#x02013;2.03). A similar reduction (P&#x0003c;0.05), from 1.84&#x000b1;0.17 (range 1.51&#x02013;2.15) to 1.74&#x000b1;0.16 (range 1.43&#x02013;2.08), was observed in the subgroup of 22 subjects where both PAL measurements were performed with doubly labeled water. The decrease in PAL was related to the initial PAL value (r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.60, P&#x0003c;0.0001), where physically active subjects showed a larger reduction. At baseline, body mass index was negatively related to PAL (r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.25, P&#x0003c;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004745-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), while at follow-up the relation had disappeared. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004745-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The majority of the subjects showed an increase in body fat with a mean value of 0.34&#x000b1;0.30 kg yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (P&#x0003c;0.0001). The rate of change of fat mass was positively related with baseline PAL (P&#x0003c;0.05) and inversely related to the difference in PAL between baseline and follow-up (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004745-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, subjects with a higher PAL at baseline gained more fat.</p><fig id="pone-0004745-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004745.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Body mass index as a function of the physical activity level at baseline (A) and at follow up (B).</title><p>Linear regression analysis shows an inverse relationship at baseline (A, continuous line) and no relationship at follow-up (B, discontinuous line), 11&#x000b1;4 yr later, in 40 subjects.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004745.g001"/></fig><fig id="pone-0004745-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004745.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Change in fat mass as a function of the difference in physical activity level.</title><p>Physical activity level at baseline (PAL<sub>1</sub>) and at follow up (PAL<sub>2</sub>), 11&#x000b1;4 yr later, in 40 healthy subjects with body-mass indices within the normal range.

The earlier reported age associated reduction of PAL and the gain in fat mass was deducted from cross-sectional data, comparing young adults with elderly, and the two phenomena could not be linked together <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004745-Westerterp1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The current analysis shows a significant gain in fat mass in adults already from the age of 27&#x000b1;5 yr onwards, observed again after 11&#x000b1;4 (range 6&#x02013;16) yr, and a close link with a change in PAL. Fat mass change ranged from a loss of 0.2 kg/yr to a gain of 1.1 kg/yr with an average gain of about 0.2 kg/yr in subjects not changing the PAL between baseline and follow-up, reflecting the fattening with increasing age corrected for the change in PAL.</p><p>In a laboratory study, Stubbs et al. showed that reducing the PAL from 1.8 to 1.4 over 7 days markedly affected energy balance.

Here, a change from an active to a more sedentary life-style resulted in fat storage reflecting insufficient adaptation of food intake to a reduced energy requirement, even in the long term.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0004745-Westerterp1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Westerterp</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name><name><surname>Plasqui</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><year>2004</year><article-title>Physical activity and human energy expenditure.</article-title><source>Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care</source><volume>7</volume><fpage>607</fpage><lpage>613</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15534427</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004745-Speakman1"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Speakman</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><year>1997</year><source>Doubly-labelled water: theory and practice</source><publisher-loc>London</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chapman &#x00026; Hall</publisher-name><fpage>399</fpage></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004745-Plasqui1"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Plasqui</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Joosen</surname><given-names>AMCP</given-names></name><name><surname>Kester</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Goris</surname><given-names>AHC</given-names></name><name><surname>Westerterp</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name></person-group><year>2005</year><article-title>Measuring free-living energy expenditure and physical activity with tri-axial accelerometry.</article-title><source>Obes Res</source><volume>13</volume><fpage>1363</fpage><lpage>1369</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16129718</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004745-Westerterp2"><label>4</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Westerterp</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name><name><surname>Speakman</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><year>2008</year><article-title>Physical activity energy expenditure has not declined since the 1980s and matches energy expenditures of wild mammals.</article-title><source>Int J Obes</source><volume>32</volume><fpage>1256</fpage><lpage>1263</lpage></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004745-Stubbs1"><label>5</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stubbs</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnstone</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Horgan</surname><given-names>GW</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><year>2004</year><article-title>A decrease in physical activity affects appetite, energy, and nutrient balance in lean men feeding ad libitum.</article-title><source>Am J Clin Nutr</source><volume>79</volume><fpage>62</fpage><lpage>69</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14684398</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004745-Williams1"><label>6</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>PT</given-names></name></person-group><year>2008</year><article-title>Asymmetric weight gain and loss from increasing and decreasing exercise.</article-title><source>Med Sci Sports Exerc</source><volume>40</volume><fpage>296</fpage><lpage>302</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18202572</pub-id></citation></ref></ref-list><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>The authors have no support or funding to report</p></fn></fn-group></back></article>
