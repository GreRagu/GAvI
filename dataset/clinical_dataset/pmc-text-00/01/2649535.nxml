In the endocrine pancreatic field, functional human beta cell lines are extremely scarce. On the other hand, rodent insulin producing beta cells have been generated during the past years with great success. Many of such cell lines were produced by using transgenic mice expressing SV40T antigen under the control of the insulin promoter, an approach clearly inadequate in human. Our objective was to develop and validate in rodent an alternative transgenic-like approach, applicable to human tissue, by performing somatic gene transfer into pancreatic progenitors that will develop into beta cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>In this study, rat embryonic pancreases were transduced with recombinant lentiviral vector expressing the SV40T antigen under the control of the insulin promoter. Transduced tissues were next transplanted under the kidney capsule of immuno-incompetent mice allowing insulinoma development from which beta cell lines were established. Gene expression profile, insulin content and glucose dependent secretion, normalization of glycemia upon transplantation into diabetic mice validated the approach to generate beta cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Somatic gene transfer into pancreatic progenitors represents an alternative strategy to generate functional beta cell lines in rodent. Moreover, this approach can be generalized to derive cells lines from various tissues and most importantly from tissues of human origin.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Islets of Langerhans are micro-organs scattered throughout the pancreas, and responsible for synthesizing and secreting pancreatic hormones. They produce hormones such as insulin (beta cells), glucagon (alpha cells) somatostatin (delta cells) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP cells). Insulin-secreting beta cells play a major role and are involved in the development of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, while type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of insulin resistance and inadequate insulin secretion. Thus, in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the functional pancreatic beta cell mass is not sufficient to control glycemia. Over the past decades research in the beta cell field profited from the establishment of insulin-secreting cell lines. Many rodent cell lines were produced from adult beta cells such as RIN and INS1 cells derived from x-ray induced adult rat insulinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Gazdar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Asfari1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and HIT cells generated by simian virus 40 transformation of adult hamster islet cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Santerre1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Such rodent cell lines were extremely useful for a better understanding of beta cell biology. Attempts were next made to generate human beta cell lines using the strategies developed for rodent cell lines. Unfortunately, the majority of the attempts were not successful.</p><p>In the present work, our objective was to validate alternative transgenic approaches to generate beta cell lines using a procedure that can be transferred to human. Specifically, we asked whether beta cell lines can be generated from embryonic pancreatic explants by somatic gene transfer into pancreatic progenitor cells that will differentiate into beta cells.</p><p>For this purpose, we transduced immature rat pancreatic tissues with recombinant lentiviral vector expressing SV40T antigen under the control of the insulin promoter. Our data demonstrate that such vector can transduce pancreatic stem/progenitors, that will differentiate into beta cells expressing the SV40T antigen and form insulinoma from which beta cell lines can be derived. This strategy that mimics transgenic-like approach represents a new process to generate beta cell lines that can be applicable to human tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Tumour formation from rat embryonic pancreases transduced with recombinant lentiviruses expressing the SV40T antigen under the control of the insulin promoter</title><p>We previously demonstrated that mature insulin producing cells can be stably modified by transduction of pancreatic progenitors with recombinant lentiviruses expressing eGFP under the control of the insulin promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Castaing1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Different approaches have been previously developed to generate pancreatic beta cells in large amount. A first one consisted in using as starting material embryonic stem cells (ES cells) to produce beta cells. The major advantage is that ES cells self-renew indefinitely in culture, and have the capacity to differentiate to multiple cell types, and thus to pancreatic beta cells. Quite a large amount of publications appeared during the past years on beta cell production from mouse ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Kahan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and more recently with human ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-DAmour1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Kroon1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. However, mass production of pure beta cells could not be achieved with such process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Kroon1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A second approach to generate large amounts of beta cells was based on the production of pancreatic beta cell lines using adult pancreas as a starting material. First experiments were performed with rodent tissues. The rat cell lines RIN and INS and the hamster cell line HIT were obtained using this approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Gazdar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Santerre1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In 2005, a human beta cell line NAKT-15 was produced using human adult islets as starting material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Narushima1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. While this cell line seemed functional and stable, to the best of our knowledge, since 2005, no information was published with this line. Thus, while major efforts were developed to generate human beta cell lines from adult islets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Narushima1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Soldevila1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> only one human beta cell line was developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Narushima1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, demonstrating the importance of generating additional human beta cell lines and of defining alternative strategies.</p><p>A third approach was to derivate beta cell lines from beta cell tumours derived from transgenic mice expressing SV40T antigen under the control of the insulin promoter. There, the immortalizing gene is expressed in beta cells as early as insulin is transcribed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Hanahan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Miyazaki1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Such lines were extremely useful as a model to deeply study mouse beta cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Hohmeier2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. However, since beta cell lines were obtained by gene transfer in fertilized eggs, its application is restricted to animal models without any possible transfer to human.</p><p>Recently, we demonstrated that immature embryonic pancreas transduced with recombinant lentiviral vectors resulted in endocrine cell differentiation and restricted cell type expression of the transgene according to the specificity of the promoter used in the viral construct. Specifically, when eGFP was placed under the control of the insulin promoter, a majority of the developed beta cells expressed eGFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Castaing1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus recombinant lentiviral vectors can efficiently transduce pancreatic progenitor cells and thereby stably modify mature rat pancreatic beta cells. Here, we asked whether such an approach could be used to generate beta cell lines. If that was the case, it would mimic the approach used to generate beta cell lines form transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Hanahan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Miyazaki1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. This will generate a transgenic like organ without gene transfer in fertilized eggs thus enabling such an approach to be used in human.</p><p>Here, we demonstrated the efficiency of the approach using rat embryonic pancreases. We first developed an approach to generate insulinoma by transducing rat embryonic pancreatic epithelia with recombinant lentiviral vectors expressing the SV40T antigen under the control of the insulin promoter. Here we show that rat embryonic pancreatic epithelia transduced with SV40T antigen expressing lentiviral vectors systematically develop insulinoma when grafted under the kidney capsule of <italic>scid</italic> mice (38 out of 38). This grafting site has been shown to be permissive for the development of many organs such as ovarian cortex, thyroid, skin and airway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Delplanque1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Levy1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this study, we selectively immortalized insulin producing cells using immature embryonic pancreatic bud as starting material. Neither acinar cells nor glucagon-expressing endocrine cells were obtained through this selective process. Furthermore, the derived insulin producing cell line did not express immature endocrine markers such as Ngn3 and Pax4. These cells are mature and express a series of beta cell transcription factors such as Pdx1, Nkx6.1, Pax6 and NeuroD1. They also express molecules crucial for beta cell function such as Pcsk1 and Pcsk2 that participate in the processing of proinsulin to insulin and C-peptide, Abcc8 that codes for the sulfonyurea receptor, Glut2 and glucokinase that are important for glucose stimulated insulin secretion, Snap25 the Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 kDa and Rab3A a small G protein, member of the Rab family and glucokinase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Halban1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Such differences will be investigated in the future.

Finally, upon transplantation, RYAS41 cells regulate the glycemia of NOD/<italic>scid</italic> mice deficient in endogenous beta cells.</p><p>Our current objective is to transfer to human the above described validated technology with the goal of generating functional human beta cell lines. Our past and current data support the feasibility of this objective.

Finally, our preliminary data indicate that human insulinoma develop upon SV40T antigen gene transfer into human pancreatic progenitors using the above described approach.</p><p>In conclusion, we described in the present work a new approach based on somatic gene transfer applicable to human tissues to generate functional beta cell lines starting from rat embryonic pancreas. This strategy provides an interesting novel route to generate human beta cell lines and also cell lines from other specific cell types using SV40 T antigen under the control of other cell type specific promoters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethical Statement</title><p>All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined by the French animal welfare bodies, and all animal work was approved by the Direction D&#x000e9;partementale des Services V&#x000e9;t&#x000e9;rinaires de Paris.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>DNA constructs and recombinant lentiviral productions</title><p>The backbone of the lentiviral construct, pTRIP, has been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004731-Zennou1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.
