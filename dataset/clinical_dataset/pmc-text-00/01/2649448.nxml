The enzymatically active component is a Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent metalloprotease that cleaves most isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MKKs). Using <italic>ex vivo</italic> differentiated human lung epithelium we report that LT destroys lung epithelial barrier function and wound healing responses by immobilizing the actin and microtubule network. Long-term exposure to the toxin generated a unique cellular phenotype characterized by increased actin filament assembly, microtubule stabilization, and changes in junction complexes and focal adhesions. LT-exposed cells displayed randomly oriented, highly dynamic protrusions, polarization defects and impaired cell migration. Reconstitution of MAPK pathways revealed that this LT-induced phenotype was primarily dependent on the coordinated loss of MKK1 and MKK2 signaling. Thus, MKKs control fundamental aspects of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility. Even though LT disabled repair mechanisms, agents such as keratinocyte growth factor or dexamethasone improved epithelial barrier integrity by reducing cell death. These results suggest that co-administration of anti-cytotoxic drugs may be of benefit when treating inhalational anthrax.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inhalational anthrax is an infectious disease caused by the uptake of aerosolized spores of the gram-positive bacterium <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> into the airways.

After a slow onset <italic>B. anthracis</italic> divides rapidly in the circulatory system, resulting in fulminant disease characterized by respiratory distress, haemorrhage, shock and sudden death of the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Shafazand1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Frazier1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The rapid and lethal development of <italic>B. anthracis</italic> sepsis is triggered by massive release of a tripartite bacterial exotoxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Turk1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Tournier1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Anthrax toxin consists of protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF). PA constitutes the receptor-binding and carrier protein, which is responsible for host cell attachment, complex formation with LF and EF, cellular entry of the toxin complex and intracellular release of LF and EF to endocytic organelles or the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Abrami1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. EF is a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that raises intracellular levels of cAMP, a second messenger altering the activity of signaling molecules including guanine nucleotide exchange factors (i.e. Epac), protein kinases (i.e. PKA) and certain ion channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Hong1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The pathological consequences of the combined binary edema toxin (ET; PA and EF) range from imbalance of fluid homeostasis and edema formation in lungs to inhibition of chemotaxis and phagocytosis, and suppression of angiogenesis in endothelial cells. LF is a Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent metalloprotease that specifically cleaves almost all of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinases (MKKs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Duesbery1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Agrawal1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The cleavage occurs close to the N terminus of MKKs and removes the so-called D-domain, a MAPK docking motif, thereby decreasing MKK-MAPK binding affinity and MKK-induced phosphorylation and activation of MAPK. MKKs provide a crucial link from many cell surface receptors to Erk, JNK and p38, and thus mediate the regulation of many transcriptional networks by mitogenic and stress signals. Binary lethal toxin (LT; PA and LF) has been connected to caspase-1-dependent cell death of susceptible innate immune cells, to endothelial cell apoptosis, and to cell cycle arrest in epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Collier1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. LT alters the host immune response by abolishing cytokine production and expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Recently, LT was linked to decreased neutrophil chemotaxis due to reduced actin filament assembly and to inhibition of actin-based motility of the intracellular pathogen <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-During1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-During2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Not all of LT's detrimental effects on host cells seem to be a consequence of abolished MKK function. Specifically, LT-induced cell death has not been conclusively linked to MKKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Turk1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that other LF target proteins may exist.</p><p>Although interference with anti-bacterial responses of the host innate and adaptive immune system is important for <italic>B. anthracis'</italic> ability to replicate rapidly, non-immune cells seem to contribute to the severity and fatality of <italic>B. anthracis</italic> infection when bacterimia-induced toxin concentrations reach considerable levels. Injection of mice with purified LT results in increased vascular leakage, pleural edema and hypoxic tissue injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Moayeri1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, pathological features in systemic anthrax infection in Rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees and inhalational anthrax victims are hemorrhages, pleural effusion and edema <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Vasconcelos1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This phenotype suggests that the barrier function of the endothelium might be affected by LT. In fact, LT caused significant endothelial barrier dysfunction in primary human microvascular endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Warfel1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This effect was not caused by apoptosis, although caspase-dependent apoptosis in LT-treated HUVEC was reported elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Kirby1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The observed increase in permeability, causing fluid leakage, could not be mimicked by suppressing all three MAP kinase pathways with chemical inhibitors and thus, the underlying mechanism of endothelial junction disruption by LT remains unresolved.</p><p>The clinical manifestation of anthrax rarely includes bronchopneumonia in the earlier stages of the disease. In contrast, the final sepsis and shock stage of infection is characterized by respiratory distress and pulmonary edema. This may indicate that the airway epithelium plays not only a role in dissemination of <italic>B. anthracis</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Russell1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, but that breakdown of the lung epithelial barrier is also a crucial, late event in anthrax lethality. In this study, we report that lethal toxin has a profound destructive effect on the barrier function of differentiated human airway epithelium. This LT-induced phenotype is the consequence of altering major components of the mammalian cytoskeleton and microtubule network, causing a state of permanent paralysis where turnover of structural components is greatly reduced. Lung epithelial cell functions, which require sustained dynamic regulation such as directed migration and multicellular junction reorganization, were abolished by LT. The structural paralysis of airway cells is MAPK pathway-dependent and can be efficiently counteracted by introducing non-cleavable MKK mutants. As this approach is currently not a therapeutic option, several compounds recognized for lung-protective function were assessed for their ability to reduce toxin-induced barrier damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Lethal toxin destroys the barrier function of human mucociliary lung epithelium</title><p>To study the effect of <italic>B. anthracis</italic> toxins on the respiratory epithelium, a three-dimensional (3D) model of polarized, mucociliary lung epithelium was established. Primary human lung epithelial cells were grown on extracellular matrix-coated filters in air-liquid interface for 3&#x02013;4 weeks. The differentiated phenotype was characterized by a marked morphological change, giving rise to a multicellular layer consisting of basal cells, non-ciliated cells, ciliated cells and goblet cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004755.s003">Figure S1A</xref>). The <italic>ex vivo</italic> differentiated airway cells formed tight and adherens junction complexes, produced mucus and expressed defensins and surfactant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004755.s003">Figure S1B&#x02013;D</xref>).

This model system was used to determine if circulating <italic>B. anthracis</italic> exotoxins alter lung epithelial cell functions. Addition of protective antigen (PA) alone or edema toxin (ET; PA and EF) into the media in the bottom chamber did not alter barrier function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004755.s004">Figure S2A</xref>), while basolateral application of lethal toxin (LT; PA and LF) caused a significant decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance and a substantial increase in permeability of the layer to fluorescently labeled albumin applied from the apical side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004755-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy revealed that treatment of the 3D epithelium with LT caused an expansion of the epithelial layer and the appearance of large paracellular spaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004755-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Staining of the untreated and LT-treated epithelium with the tight junction marker ZO1 showed disruption of the apical junction network at multicellular connection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004755-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). When exposed to LT, human lung epithelial cells cultured in typical 2D conditions, did not exhibit any signs of apoptosis as judged with caspase 3-mediated cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, by analysis of phosphatidylserine exposure, by DNA laddering or by transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. However, up to 5&#x00025; of cells detached during the first 48 hours of treatment. This loss of attached cells did not accelerate substantially after prolonged incubation in growth factor-containing media, although LT-treated cells failed to resume proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004755.s004">Figure S2B</xref>). In polarized lung epithelium a minor, but reproducible increase of cell death was observed after 48 hours of LT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004755-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), which would be sufficient for loss of barrier function if junction complex remodeling is disturbed.</p><fig id="pone-0004755-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004755.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>LT destroys barrier function in differentiated mucociliary human lung epithelium.</title><p>(A&#x02013;D) Polarized NHBE were treated with or without LT for 48 h.

As F-actin content in general was enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004755-g003">Figure 3A, 3F</xref>), analysis of the actin depolymerization/polymerization cycle was performed. Quantification of remaining F-actin filaments after 1 hour of cytocholasin B treatment showed delayed actin depolymerization in cells exposed to LT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004755-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). After washout F-actin filaments repolymerized into the originally observed phenotypes in control and LT-treated cells (data not shown). Incubation of LT-treated cells with latrunculin A, which prevents actin polymerization by forming complexes with actin monomers, produced a depolymerization delay similar as illustrated for cytocholasin B (data not shown). The microtubule network and the actin cytoskeleton are interdependent, and thus profound actin reorganization is likely accompanied by changes in the microtubular system. Untreated primary lung epithelial cells displayed a radial meshwork of thin and wavy &#x003b1;-tubulin-containing structures. Exposure to LT produced a different pattern, where long microtubules extended straight to the cell periphery and into the large protrusions, resembling a &#x0201c;combed&#x0201d; phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004755-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

As reported earlier in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Ha1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, this loss of MKKs is not due to reduced MKK transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004755-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). As MAPKs have been implicated in cytoskeletal dynamics and their upstream signaling partners MKKs represent the only identified LT targets, we reasoned that the striking, LT-induced cell morphology changes could be triggered by LT-mediated disabling of the Erk, JNK or p38 pathway. Inhibition of these signaling cascades can be mimicked by incubation with chemical inhibitors of the kinase activity of MKK1/2 (U0126; for downstream Erk1/2 inhibition), of JNK (JNKII) and of p38 (SB203580). All three inhibitors altered the morphological phenotype and cell motility of lung epithelial cells, although JNK inhibition changed the cell shape in a distinct manner, leading to overall cell contraction. The combined use of all three inhibitors, a treatment mimicking LT action on MAPK activity, resembled closely the LT-induced phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004755-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004755.s010">Movie S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004755.s011">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004755.s012">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004755.s013">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004755.s014">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004755.s015">S8</xref>).</p><p>Formation and orientation of a single stable protrusion together with the polarization of the MTOC is a prerequisite for directed migration.

MKK-MAPK pathways mediate crucial signals from the extracellular milieu to gene transcription, thus affecting cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and inflammatory mediator release. Accumulating evidence suggests that MAPKs might also control cell migration, although the precise mechanism remains obscure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Huang1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Pullikuth1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. After 24 hours of LT exposure, complete MKK1-7 (except MKK5) deficiency was observed in lung epithelial cells, which was maintained over the observation period of up to 4 days. LT-mediated cytoskeletal alterations, present after the first 24 hours, were sustained even when a depolymerization / repolymerization cycle was induced by addition and subsequnent removal of depolymerizing agents. The presence of multiple overlapping cytoskeletal targets, which control actin and microtubule dynamics indicate that coordinated input from all three major MAPK pathways might be important for maintenance of cell shape and motility. The distinct morphological and functionally paralyzed phenotype caused by exposure of primary human lung epithelial cells to LT supports this notion. Some networks involved in motility may have redundancy, as the successful 2-dimensional wound closure by three different pairs of non-cleavable MKKs suggests. On the other hand, introduction of single non-cleavable MKKs into lung epithelial cells was not sufficient for reversal of paralyzed actin and microtubule networks. Thus, one may speculate that MKK1 and MKK2 may trigger not only Erk1 and Erk2 signaling pathways. MKKs may participate in interactions with molecules essential for connecting membrane dynamics with actin assembly such as cortactin or MP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Pullikuth1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Weed1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

In our study, F-actin content was increased and introduction of non-cleavable MKKs upstream of p38 MAPK rescued 2-dimensional lung epithelial wound healing only if signaling by both, MKK3 and MKK6, was restored. This rescue was not specific for the MKK3/MKK6 pair and did not improve chemotaxis. The cytoskeletal networks of neutrophils that are required for priming responses, polarization, and chemotaxis are quite distinct, and likely controlled by different signaling pathways than those important for cytoskeletal responses and junction formation in other cell types. Endothelial cells, which also form a tight barrier, seem to undergo cell elongation after LT treatment and succumb more or less to apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-Warfel1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004755-vanSorge1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Treatment with KGF or the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone alleviated LT-mediated barrier damage significantly, thus providing a potential therapeutic option for anthrax victims.
