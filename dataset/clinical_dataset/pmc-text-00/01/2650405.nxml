Genome wide surveys of tetraspanins from a broad array of organisms with fully sequenced genomes are an excellent means to understand specifics of intron evolution. Our approach incorporated several new fully sequenced genomes that cover the major lineages of the animal kingdom as well as plants, protists and fungi. The analysis of exon/intron gene structure in such an evolutionary broad set of genomes allowed us to identify ancestral intron structure in tetraspanins throughout the eukaryotic tree of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We performed a phylogenomic analysis of the intron/exon structure of the tetraspanin protein family. In addition, to the already characterized tetraspanin introns numbered 1 through 6 found in animals, three additional ancient, phase 0 introns we call 4a, 4b and 4c were found. These three novel introns in combination with the ancestral introns 1 to 6, define three basic tetraspanin gene structures which have been conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Our phylogenomic approach also allows the estimation of the time at which the introns of the 33 human tetraspanin paralogs appeared, which in many cases coincides with the concomitant acquisition of new introns. On the other hand, we observed that new introns (introns other than 1&#x02013;6, 4a, b and c) were not randomly inserted into the tetraspanin gene structure. The region of tetraspanin genes corresponding to the small extracellular loop (SEL) accounts for only 10.5&#x00025; of the total sequence length but had 46&#x00025; of the new animal intron insertions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our results indicate that tests of intron evolution are strengthened by the phylogenomic approach with specific gene families like tetraspanins. These tests add to our understanding of genomic innovation coupled to major evolutionary divergence events, functional constraints and the timing of the appearance of evolutionary novelty.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic protein coding genes are interspersed with non coding sequences called introns that are removed from the corresponding transcripts by the spliceosome, a complex RNA-protein assemblage.

Despite the vast amount of information generated since their discovery and the importance of introns in understanding gene organization, many issues regarding intron evolution remain enigmatic. These issues include the timing of intron origin and proliferation, the evolutionary history of introns and mechanisms of intron loss/gain in eukaryotic organisms, and the evolutionary dynamics that can explain their existence. These issues have led many researchers of intron biology to ask - is there a selective advantage to having introns and if so what is the advantage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Roy1">&#x0005b;for recent reviews see: 3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Lynch1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Studies on the evolution of spliceosomal introns mainly use broad genomic data sets of conserved homologous genes from diverse eukaryotic organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Roy1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Irimia1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Rogozin2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Fedorov1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

The recently fully sequenced genomes of multiple eukaryotic species covering broad evolutionary divergences, makes analysis of intron-exon structure of individual gene families an interesting option. In particular, taking a phylogenomic approach to understand the distribution of intron/exon evolution in a suitable gene family would allow the determination of ancestral states of intron presence/absence, and allow for the correlation of intron loss/gain events with function and to place time estimates on intron/exon evolutionary events.</p><p>We suggest that suitable gene families to apply the phylogenomic approach to examine intron/exon structure would be ones with many members, several introns in each paralog and a broad phylogenetic distribution. The tetraspanin superfamily of proteins meets all three of these important requirements.

The ability of tetraspanins to carry out multiple interactions relies upon their characteristic structure. Structurally, tetraspanins are proteins of only 200&#x02013;300 amino acids, with four conserved transmembrane domains which delimit one small extracellular loop of 13&#x02013;31 aminoacids (SEL; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004680-g001">Figure 1</xref>), a short intracellular sequence and a large extracellular loop of 69 to 132 aminoacids (LEL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Boucheix2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Stipp1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. These SEL and LEL regions are the least conserved regions of tetraspanins. The LEL has two domains: a constant region, containing three &#x003b1;-helices (H-A, H-B, and H-E) without cysteines and a variable region, characterized by the presence of cysteines that form a structural scaffold of disulfide bridges that allows for high sequence variability on the inter-cysteine loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004680-g001">Fig 1A, B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Seigneuret1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

In our previous study we utilized information from tetraspanin paralogues from fully sequenced genomes (bilaterian animals - protostomes and deuterostomes, plants - monocots and dicots, fungi - Microsporidia, Zygomycota and Asmcycota, and protists - Amoebozoa and Excavates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-GarciaEspana1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>). For the present study, we add tetraspanin paralogues from non bilaterian animals (Cnidarians, Placozoa and Poriferans), Choanoflagellates (the closest unicellular relatives of animals), Fungi (chitridiomicota), Plants (lycophytes and mosses) and Protists (stramenopiles, alveolates and discicristates).

First, we can examine whether the tetraspanins corroborate already well-established patterns of exon/intron loss in other genes. Because there are several introns in the tetraspanins this allows us to test hypotheses of intron gain/loss very precisely. Second, we hypothesize that major structural changes in tetraspanin genes with respect to exon/intron structure are associated with major cladogenetic events in the eukaryotic tree of life. This hypothesis stems from ideas about major radiations of organisms being accompanied by similar major adaptations. In order to test this hypothesis, we reconstruct the gain/loss of introns on a well corroborated eukaryotic tree and examine where on the tree the gain/loss events occur. Third, we hypothesize that substantial exon/intron structural changes that occur in tetraspanins are associated with major functional changes in these proteins. This hypothesis can be tested by examining whether any other physical aspects of tetraspanins change concurrently with exon/intron alterations. Specifically, we examine if changes in the cysteine motifs in tetraspanins are coincidental or correlated with exon/intron changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sequence analysis of sponge tetraspanin introns and the discovery of three novel ancient animal tetraspanin introns</title><p>Sponges are often considered the most primitive diploblastic (two tissue layers) animals.

In this short domain that corresponds to only 10.5&#x00025; of the total sequence surveyed, we found 36.7&#x00025; of the 79 novel intron gains in tetraspanins (a ratio of 3.5 times greater rate than expected over random).

The remainder of the tetraspanin gene regions (the four trasmenmbrane domains and the LEL without the variable subdomain; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004680-g001">Fig 1</xref>), had a frequency of intron insertions 5.8 times lower than that of the SEL (a frequency of 0.60 for each region).

Our character mapping of intron loss/gain in tetrasapanins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004680-g004">Figure 4</xref>) suggests that intron/exon junctions 1 and 4 existed in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes, while the intron/exon junction combination of 1 through 6 existed in the common ancestor of animals. How can we best explain this distribution with respect to intron gain and loss? Hypothesizing that all six of these &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; introns existed in the common ancestor of eukaryotes requires the parallel loss of introns 2, 3, 5 and 6 in the protist, plant and fungal lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004680-g004">Figure 4</xref>). An alternative hypothesis is that the common ancestor of all eukaryotes had introns 1 and 4 and that the common ancestor of animals acquired introns 2, 3, 5 and 6. This alternative hypothesis is better because it requires many fewer evolutionary loss and gain events (4 versus 12). Even if the loss or gain of introns 2, 3, 4 and 5 is considered a single evolutionary event, the scenario with fewer steps (1 step versus 3 steps) suggests that the common ancestor of animals acquired the four &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; introns 2, 3, 5 and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004680-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This analysis supports a mixture of introns late and introns early in the evolution of tetraspanins (depending on what one considers &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;late&#x0201d;) and is similar to the conclusions made by Rogozin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Rogozin2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004680-g006">Figure 6</xref> clearly demonstrates that the bulk of tetraspanin introns are the result of gains both at the tips of the tree for the organisms involved in this study, and for internal nodes. One exception to this general trend is the internal node defining protostomes (in the present study protostomes are represented by <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Intron gain/loss is correlated with cladogenetic events in the tree of life</title><p>Early studies of intron gain/loss indicated that intron gain is prevalent in eukaryotic genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Roy2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Kumar1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

Babenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Babenko1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> analyzed the evolution of exon/intron structure of paralogous genes in several eukaryotic lineages and concluded that intron loss dominates at short evolutionary distances, whereas bursts of intron insertion might accompany major evolutionary transitions. In addition, Carmel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Carmel1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Carmel2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> showed that evolutionarily conserved genes and gene families accumulate introns more readily than rapidly evolving genes. We can directly test this hypothesis using the patterns observed in tetraspanins. The gain/loss of tetraspanin introns coincides with the major organismal radiations and there are very few intron gain/loss events found in single taxa in our study (except the protosomes, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>). Most tetraspanins (20 of 33 human tetraspanins) originated in the common ancestor of vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-GarciaEspana1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004680-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). A few other tetraspanin groups can be traced to the common ancestor of mammals (4 out of 33 human tetraspanins; 18). The appearance of these new tetraspanins coincides in nearly all cases with the concomitant acquisition of new introns. On the other hand, the large number of protostome tetraspanins (from flies and worms) have few orthologs with the 33 tetraspanins in <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, and hence few orthologous intron acquisitions. Because we only used a limited taxonomic sampling for our comparisons, the suggestion that major intron loss and gains coincide with the divergence of major organismal groups needs to be tested with the acquisition of more whole genomes. Nevertheless, our data are consistent with the notion that intron structure changes are major evolutionary events that coincide with adaptive or anatomical divergence.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Are intron gain/loss events correlated with function?</title><p>The generation of functional diversity in gene families is another interesting aspect that might be correlated with intron gain/loss events.

One explanation is that some of these intron location constraints could be caused by the amino acid composition of these regions which have nucleotide compositions found at different frequencies in various protein secondary structure elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Dibb1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-DeKee1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The regions in tetraspanins where introns are less frequently found (mainly the transmembrane domains) have distinct and conserved secondary structures mainly formed by &#x003b1;-helices. These &#x003b1;-helices shape the transmembrane domains and form a tree trunk like structure in the LEL constant domain from which the LEL variable domain extends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Seigneuret1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Kitadokoro1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, the SEL loop and the LEL variable domain have a lower tendency for &#x003b1;-helix formation that could explain in part its higher frequency of intron gains in comparison to regions with &#x003b1;-helices. One reason why derived introns in tertraspanins are less frequently found in the DNA coding for &#x003b1;-helices could be the caused by the effects of purifying natural selection, as a result of the chance of disrupting the &#x003b1;-helices. Large alternative splice events or subtle changes produced by NAGNAG tandem acceptors that could be produced by the insertion of new introns would severely disrupt the &#x003b1;-helical structure of these regions. It is reasonable to assume that natural selection will eliminate variation caused by novel intron insertions in &#x003b1;-helices because of the disruption of the primary structure in these regions of tetraspanins. Such purifying selection would be absent or weak in DNA regions coding for flexible or loosely packed parts of a fold and hence such regions could accrue more novel intron insertions. Our observations on tetraspanin introns suggest that a systematic analysis of intron evolution, in suitable protein families where new and ancient introns could be differentiated, may shed light in the mechanisms of intron gain and loss and their relationship to protein structure and function.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Intron sliding in tetraspanins</title><p>That specific intron junctions sometimes differ among species by only a few nucleotides is a well known although rare phenomena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Rogozin3">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Stoltzfus1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.

We observed several instances of putative intron sliding in tetraspanins in which intron positions were shifted among different species. It has been pointed out that exon length variations could be caused by extension or contraction of exons at the intron junctions, as for example by the assimilation of adjacent intron sequences by one exon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Craik1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. This hypothesis plus that the shifted intron positions were located in the extracellular variable domain let us to check if intron exon sequences could be implicated as a source of sequence variability by producing expansion or contraction of exons length. To study this phenomenon further, we gathered orthologous tetraspanins in the close relatives to the species in which the shift took place. In two instances, CD81 intron 5 and TSPAN14 intron 4c (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004680.s006">Figures S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004680.s007">S6</xref>), we were able to compare the intron sequence in two closely related species which ruled out any implication of the intron sequence in the exon change of length. It seems the variation of length at the end of the exons was due to indel loss or gain, a frequent cause of divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004680-Britten1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Testing hypotheses about intron evolution with tetraspanins</title><p>The tetraspanin family is particularly well suited to addressing questions about protein function and evolution in a phylogenomic context. Because the structure and function of many of the members of the gene family are well known, these attributes of tretraspanins can be examined for correlation with intron change and organismal evolution. Because the number of introns in the tetraspanin family is reasonably large, and the phylogenetic distribution of genomes that can be used for such studies covers all of eukaryotes, specific evolutionary questions about introns can be addressed. Using tetraspanins, we were able to examine several aspects of intron evolution in a very precise manner. First, we examined the overall phylogenetic distribution of intron change and found that much of the intron gain/loss occurs in major phylogenetic branching events, specifically in the origin of the vertebrates. Second, we show that a proportionately larger number of intron gain/loss events occur in the large and small extracellular loops (LEL and SEL) than anywhere else in the protein structure. Finally, we examine the dynamics of intron gain/loss in the context of reading phase shifts. Close examination of tetraspanins allows for very precise statements to be made about these phenomena related to intron evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Data mining and Sequence analysis</title><p>Intron-exon borders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004680.s001">Table S1</xref>) were determined or verified aligning the tetraspanin sequences to their respective genomic region with the Align two sequences option of the NCBI BLAST program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>) and manual supervision of the splice consensus signals.

By reconstructing ancestors in the phylogenetic tree we can decipher the transition of intron/exon structure over evolutionary time. Two kinds of information on intron/exon junction need to be made clear. First, any whole genome that has been characterized for tetraspanin intron/exon pattern can equivocally be used to determine the pattern in common ancestors. The second kind of information on intron/exon presence is found in incompletely sequenced genomes. In these cases, only the presence of an intron/exon junction can be considered as equivocal. The absence of the junction in such cases is not inferable. Consequently, we constructed a presence absence matrix for all of the known introns and exons in tetraspanins from fully sequenced genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Mapping intron/exon structure on phylogenetic hypothesis</title><p>We mapped these presence absence data onto a phylogenetic hypotheses for the animals in the study.
