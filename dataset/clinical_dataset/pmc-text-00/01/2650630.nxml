Here, we systematically analyzed PPIs in the nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium <italic>Mesorhizobium loti</italic> using a modified high-throughput yeast two-hybrid system. The aims of this study are primarily on the providing functional clues to <italic>M. loti</italic> proteins that are relevant to symbiotic nitrogen fixation and conserved in other rhizobium species, especially proteins with regulatory functions and unannotated proteins. By the screening of 1542 genes as bait, 3121 independent interactions involving 1804 proteins (24% of the total protein coding genes) were identified and each interaction was evaluated using an interaction generality (IG) measure and the general features of the interacting partners. Most PPIs detected in this study are novel interactions revealing potential functional relationships between genes for symbiotic nitrogen fixation and signal transduction. Furthermore, we have predicted the putative functions of unannotated proteins through their interactions with known proteins. The results described here represent new insight into protein network of <italic>M. loti</italic> and provide useful experimental clues to elucidate the biological function of rhizobial genes that can not be assigned directly from their genomic sequence.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd><italic>Mesorhizobium loti</italic></kwd><kwd>Protein&#x02013;protein interaction</kwd><kwd>Yeast two-hybrid system</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria belonging to the family Rhizobiaceae (rhizobia) are biologically unique organisms that exhibit two distinct lifestyles in nature, as free-living soil bacteria or as symbionts of some leguminous plants. In nitrogen-starved soil, rhizobia can colonize the roots of compatible legumes and elicit the formation of specialized organ, the root nodules. Inside the nodules, rhizobia differentiate into non-dividing form of bacteria (bacteroid) and reduce atmospheric dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) into biologically usable ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). Nitrogen fixed by the symbiotic rhizobia is then assimilated by the host plant, enabling the plant to grow in nitrogen-depleted environments.</p><p>Because of the agronomic importance of rhizobia, complete genome sequencing has been accomplished in seven rhizobia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C6">6</xref></sup> and is now in progress on several additional species. The availability of complete genome sequences allows us to know the global features of the organism &#x02018;rhizobium&#x02019; at the molecular level. Simultaneously, the genome sequences also provide genetic platforms for comparative study of genome structure within rhizobia, or between rhizobia and other plant-associated bacteria. These comparative analyses have revealed the existence of a genomic region enriched for genes involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation (symbiosis island), as well as various specialized gene sets for signal transduction and membrane transport that allow rhizobia to adapt to the environment of both soil and intracellular of host plant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C7">7</xref></sup></p><p>Although a genome sequence is very useful, the genome sequence alone is not sufficient to reveal the specific molecular functions of all the genes. To date, genetic analyses, such as targeted gene disruption or transposon random mutagenesis, have revealed various rhizobial genes essential for nodule formation and nitrogen fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C8">8</xref></sup> Additionally, with the completion of several rhizobial genome sequences, comprehensive transcriptome or proteome analysis has been carried out in order to understand physiological states of rhizobia under a variety of conditions such as symbiosis with host legume or nutrient-depleted conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C14">14</xref></sup> These analyses have allowed us to know expressional dynamics throughout the rhizobial genome and to discover numerous novel genes and proteins not previously known to be involved in these conditions.</p><p>Although a large amount of data have been accumulated through these functional analyses, many genes predicted on the rhizobial genome remain functionally unannotated. That is primarily because that the genome sequence and expression profiles give an indirect and fragmented picture of the biological function of genes, and more detailed information on gene function would be obtained by biochemical properties of the gene products (proteins) or by their interaction with other proteins of known function. Therefore, more interactive and systematic analysis that accelerates functional assignment for many rhizobial genes simultaneously is required.</p><p>As a first effort to examine the protein networks of rhizobia, we conducted a large-scale analysis of protein&#x02013;protein interactions (PPIs) in <italic>Mesorhizobium loti</italic> using a yeast two-hybrid (YTH) system. YTH analysis is one of the well-established methods for mapping binary protein interactions and its usefulness is clearly illustrates by the fact that comprehensive studies of PPIs in several model organisms have provided several important biological and bioinformatics platforms for the study of protein networks in the organism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C18">18</xref></sup> These analyses have also successfully placed functionally uncharacterized proteins into their biological context.</p><p>In this study, for the selection of target gene groups for the YTH screening, we primarily used two available information, the genomic information and the results of a transcriptome analysis of <italic>M. loti</italic>. Symbiosis island contains many genes for symbiotic nitrogen fixation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C1">1</xref></sup> and the clustered up-regulation of genes in symbiosis island under bacteroid state were observed by macroarray analysis of <italic>M. loti</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C14">14</xref></sup> The macroarray analysis also revealed that several genes located outside of symbiosis island were also up-regulated under bacteroid or microaerobic condition. Although these features led us to hypothesize that genes located in the symbiotic island and those up-regulated under symbiosis are involved in certain physiological events of symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the biological significance of the majority of these genes has not yet been revealed. Identification of PPIs of these gene products will help elucidate their biological function and expand our knowledge of the mechanism of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Therefore, we selected these genes for the initial target of our analysis. Complete genome sequences of several rhizobium species enables us to survey the conserved orthologous genes among rhizobia. Since conserved genes are presumed to execute common functions, the obtained PPI data from the <italic>M. loti</italic> YTH screening can be applied to other rhizobia. Among conserved genes, we primarily selected <italic>M. loti</italic> genes of unknown function and those with regulatory functions, in order to reveal the biological roles of the functionally unannotated proteins and signal transduction pathways that function commonly among rhizobium species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Construction of bait clones and prey library</title><p>The backbone of our YTH screening is the MATCHMAKER GAL-4 based YTH system.

The number of interactions in each category is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="DSM028TB2">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>.</p><p>To assess the validity of our categorization, we evaluated all detected interactions using the IG measurement, a method for computationally assessing the reliability of PPI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C21">21</xref></sup> Interactions with lower IG values are more likely to be reliable than interactions with higher IG values. The IG values for all detected interactions ranged from 1 to 62 and the average IG value was 10.2. When we examined the interactions in which the IG values were &#x0003c;5, &#x0003e;94% of interactions in category A, B, and C were included, whereas only 32% of category D interactions were included (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;1). The average IG values for category A (2.37 &#x000b1; 0.16), B (2.21 &#x000b1; 0.17), and C (2.75 &#x000b1; 0.72) were significantly lower (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) than that of category D (26.0 &#x000b1; 3.49) when 50 independent interactions were selected randomly from each category and compared. This result indicates that our classification is appropriate to define the reliability of each interaction.</p><p>To minimize false positives caused by self-activation, we used multiple reporter genes driven by different GAL4-responsive promoters and carefully determined the level of self-activation of each bait clone (see Materials and methods). Furthermore, we re-screened bait proteins under more stringent conditions when the bait protein generated an excessive number of positive colonies (&#x0003e;300 colonies per bait). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="DSM028TB2">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>, 31 bait proteins displayed strong self-activation which could not be suppressed by leaky HIS3 reporter gene expression even in the presence of 50 mM 3-AT and the interactions derived from these strong self-active bait clones were discarded. A total of 148 bait clones (9.6% of all screened baits) were screened in the presence of 50 mM 3-AT (Supplementary Table 4). As expected, several bait clones harboring genes with regulatory functions such as transcriptional regulators or two-component response regulators (RRs) showed self-activation. However, 92 out of 148 were genes annotated as hypothetical or unknown protein. To examine the protein domains responsible for their self-activation, we examined the known protein domains assigned in these genes. Although several kinds of bacterial regulatory protein domains, such as LuxR (IPR000792), LysR (IPR000847), and RR receiver (REC) (IPR001789) domain, are frequently found among self-active genes, some proteins with a domain of unknown function (DUF domain) and hypothetical or unknown proteins with no known protein domains were also included.</p><p>In addition to the detection of false positives, large-scale PPI analyses tend to miss a large number of known interactions (false negatives). The precise proportion of false-negative interactions can be determined by comparison with published experimental PPI data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C18">18</xref></sup> However, this approach is difficult to apply to <italic>M. loti</italic> PPI analysis because the available data regarding protein interactions of <italic>M. loti</italic> are limited. To compensate for this problem, we estimated the proportion of false-negatives based on the interactions of proteins in two-component signal transducers whose interaction can be predicted by the location of the corresponding genes in the genome. In the <italic>M. loti</italic> genome, 30 pairs of genes encoding a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and RR are considered to forms operons and, of these, 15 pairs were detected from screening all RR and 37 HK used as bait, indicating that &#x0223c;50% of the interactions could not be detected by our analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><label>3.3.</label><title>General features of PPIs</title><p>A global view of the protein interaction network is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSM028F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>A.

Proteins in the obtained protein network cover all functional categories of <italic>M. loti</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSM028F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>B), and interactions are presented as scale-free network, since most proteins had few connections and only a small number had many connections.</p><p>Prokaryotic genes are generally organized into operons in which genes are transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA. Several previous studies have demonstrated that genes encoded in the same operon are likely to be coordinately linked and carry out related functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C27">27</xref></sup> In all the interactions detected, we found 36 interacting pairs that were encoded by genes that mapped to adjacent loci in the <italic>M. loti</italic> genome (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;5a and b). Notably, 14 out of 36 protein pairs were category A interactions and the frequency of category A interactions between proteins encoded by adjacent genes is significantly higher than that of the whole network. This result further supports the validity of our evaluation of protein interaction data by interaction category. Among the interacting protein encoded at adjacent loci, 15 interactions contained at least one protein of unknown function. Among these, we found a putative part of a sarcosine oxidase complex composed of Mll6238 (annotated as sarcosine oxidase alpha subunit) and Mll6237 (unknown protein that contains a protein domain of sarcosine oxidase gamma subunit). We also found a putative protein complex required for chromosome condensation and segregation between Mll1088 (hypothetical protein contains ScpA domain; IPR003768) and Mll1087 (hypothetical protein contains ScpB domain; IPR005234). Considering that genes belonging to the same operon are predicted to have related functions, the interactions extracted according to the genomic position permit us to predict the biological function of unknown proteins and provides experimental evidence to reinforce the functional relationships between proteins encoded by adjacent genes.</p><p>We also identified 25 self-interacting proteins and 9 hetero-dimeric interactions that occurred between two paralogous proteins (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;6). Approximately half of the self-interacting proteins have regulatory functions, and some contained several types of helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs. This result is reasonable because HTH-containing proteins are known to execute their function in the form of homo-dimers or homo-tetramors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C28">28</xref></sup> and homo-dimeric forms of these proteins have been identified in several microorganisms by large-scale PPI analysis and X-ray diffraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C30">30</xref></sup> Furthermore, as observed in yeast and some other eucaryotes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C31">31</xref></sup> the paralogous-interacting proteins detected here tended to exhibit self-interaction. For example, the self-interacting Mll3429 and Mlr5643 also interacted with their paralogues, Mll2335 and Mll3718, respectively. In addition, three other proteins (Mlr6361, Shikimate kinase; Mll8202, GroES; and Mlr2806, NolR) are also known to form homo-dimers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C34">34</xref></sup> indicating that this tendency may support the hypothesis that duplication of self-interacting proteins can generate paralogous proteins whose interactions create functional and structural diversification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C31">31</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s3d"><label>3.4.</label><title>Interaction of symbiosis related proteins</title><p>YTH screening with 581 genes that were selected based on their expression profiles and location in symbiosis island generated 646 interaction pairs (excluding category D interactions). Among the relatively reliable interactions (interaction categories A and B), the proportion of interactions between proteins encoded in symbiosis island was significantly higher (20%) than the ratio expected (8%) by random interactions. This result may reflect the existence of interrelated functions among proteins within the symbiosis island, as suggested by the clustered expression of genes in symbiosis island under the bacteroid state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C14">14</xref></sup></p><p>In the <italic>M. loti</italic> genome, 40 genes for nodulation and 46 genes for nitrogen fixation were assigned by whole genome sequencing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C1">1</xref></sup> Interactions were detected on 13 genes for nodulation and 27 genes for nitrogen fixation, respectively. Among these interactions, we successfully identified several interaction pairs whose functional relationships have been proven experimentally, such as NtrX (Mlr0400)&#x02013;NtrY (Mlr0399) and FixL (Mll6607)&#x02013;FixJ (Mll6606), which are two-component sensor-regulator pairs that participate in nitrogen metabolisms and sensing of environmental oxygen tension,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C35">35</xref></sup> and NtrR (Mll1670)&#x02013;NtrP (Mll1671) operon that function in complex as toxin-antitoxin module.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C36">36</xref></sup> Detection of these known interactions indicates that the rhizobial proteins we screened here retained their native conformation in yeast cells.</p><p>One of the advantages of interactome analysis is that interactions between novel proteins and well-characterized ones provide us highly informative hints to expand our knowledge, and such interactions were found on several symbiosis-related proteins. For example, a two-component RR (Mll9592) encoded in the <italic>M. loti</italic> plasmid (pMLb) interacted with two distinct NifA proteins (Mll5857 and Mll5837). NifA is a transcriptional activator that controls, in concert with RNA polymerase sigma factor, the expression of genes for nitrogen fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C38">38</xref></sup> Unlike other known sigma factor-interacting transcriptional activators such as DctD and NtrC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C39">39</xref></sup> NifA protein lacks the REC domain which accept the phosphoryl signal from the cognate sensor HK. In contrast, Mll9592 contains a REC domain but lacks any DNA binding domains. Considering their physical interaction and the distribution of protein domains, Mll9592 may execute its function by forming a complex with NifA proteins.</p><p>We identified several interactions of proteins encoded by genes whose expression is up-regulated in the bacteroid state or by microaerobic condition. It is noteworthy that approximately one-third of the proteins that interacted with proteins encoded by the up-regulated genes are functionally unannotated proteins. For example, msr6604 which encodes small protein of unknown function that located upstream of the <italic>FixLJ</italic> (mll6606&#x02013;mll6607) operon interacted with both FixL (Mll6607) and FixJ (Mll6606) (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;7). Likewise, Mll9215 which was annotated as unknown protein interacted with two distinct FixO proteins (Mll6629 and Mlr6412) (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;7) and expression of the three genes encoding these proteins was up-regulated in the bacteroid state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C14">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, interaction of proteins encoded by up-regulated genes also revealed putative interaction on several molecular chaperones. For instance, Mll3429 (endopeptidase Clp ATP-binding chain B; ClpB) interacted with Mll2335 (probable ClpA/B-type protease). The expression of mll3429 was up-regulated under microaerobiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C14">14</xref></sup> and its orthologous protein (blr1404) of <italic>B. japonicum</italic> USDA110 were identified to be expressed specifically in soybean nodule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C13">13</xref></sup> This result indicates that interaction between Mll3429 and Mll2335 may be a part of protease complex that function in protein processing during symbiosis. In addition, Mll3623 (unknown protein) interacted with two paralogous heat-shock proteins (Mlr4721 and Mlr4720) encoded by genes in the same operon. The genes encoding these heat-shock proteins were up-regulated under microaerobic condition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C14">14</xref></sup> indicating that Mll3623 may be a target of these heat-shock proteins or may be involved in protection of proteins against microaerobic stress-induced protein denaturation and aggregation. Although the biological significance of these interactions remains to be solved, our results imply that many proteins of unknown function are involved in various aspects of symbiotic nitrogen fixation and our PPI data will provide useful clues to reveal the functional relationships between them.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><label>3.5.</label><title>Interactions of proteins with regulatory functions</title><p>In order to acquire PPI information leads to understanding of signal transduction pathways that functioned in rhizobium, we screened <italic>M. loti</italic> genes with regulatory functions.

Two-component signal transduction systems, composed of a HK and RR, are the predominant systems by which bacteria sense several environmental changes, and through a linear phosphorelay from the HK to its cognate RR, cells can adapt rapidly to new conditions. Considering their specific functional relationship, the interaction of two-component signal transducers are suitable models not only to evaluate our PPI data but also to reveal novel part of signaling pathways in <italic>M. loti</italic>. In the <italic>M. loti</italic> genome, 46 and 58 genes encoding HK and RR are assigned, respectively, and, among them, 30 pairs of HK and RR are considered to be transcribed in single operons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C40">40</xref></sup> From screening of 38 HKs and all the RRs as bait, 33 interactions between HK and RR were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSM028F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>). Among these interactions, we successfully identified 15 pairs of HK and RR that encoded by the same operon, and most of these interactions were supported by multiple positive clones.

Since it is difficult to know the specific functional partner of HK or RR from their sequence, the interaction pairs described here provide evidence to support the functional relationships among putative cognate HK and RR encoded in a single operon and also allow us to predict the functional partners of HK or RR located in different regions of the <italic>M. loti</italic> genome. In addition to one-to-one interactions between HK and RR, we found several interactions that occurred between multiple HKs and a single RR, and vice versa (e.g. Mll6691 and Mlr6540). The existence of cross-regulation in two-component systems has been reported in several bacteria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM028C42">42</xref></sup> but not in rhizobia.

Of these, 569 proteins of unknown function had at least one partner of known function and 94 showed interactions with two or more known protein of same function category. For example, Mlr0746 (unknown protein) interacted with three distinct transcriptional regulators (Mlr0745, Mll5360, and Mll2255) which are paralogous proteins with the same protein domains (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;7), suggesting that Mlr0746 may have any roles in regulating transcription. Furthermore, to obtain more detailed information about the function unknown proteins, we examined the PPIs of function unknown proteins at the level of protein domains. By focusing on common interaction partners or common protein domains, we assigned 42 unannotated (including 25 conserved) proteins to nine distinct functional categories (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;7). This approach allowed us to identify component of protein complexes that had not been assigned by gene annotation. For example, Mll2736 (hypothetical protein) which contains a ClpS core domain (IPR003769) interacts with two distinct Clp proteases (Mll0663 and Mll2335). Mlr3346 (hypothetical protein) contains a phosphonate metabolism PhnJ domain (IPR010306) and interacts with paralogous hypothetical proteins (Mll9155 and Mlr3342) that contain a phnG domain (IPR009609).
