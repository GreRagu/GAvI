Moreover, it cannot provide enough information on the environmental factors that are important for pathogenesis of certain diseases. However, this is not a problem for RNA diagnostics, which evaluate the expression of the gene in question. We here report a novel RNA diagnostics tool that can be employed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To establish this tool, we identified 290 genes that are highly expressed in normal PBMCs but not in TIG-1, a normal human fibroblast cell. These genes were entitled <italic>PREP</italic> after predominantly expressed in PBMC and included 50 uncharacterized genes. We then conducted <italic>PREP</italic> gene-focused microarray analysis on PBMCs from seven cases of Churg&#x02013;Strauss syndrome (CSS), which is a small-vessel necrotizing vasculitis. We found that <italic>PREP135</italic> (coactosin-like protein), <italic>PREP77</italic> (prosaposin), <italic>PREP191</italic> (cathepsin D), <italic>PREP234</italic> (<italic>c</italic>-fgr), and <italic>PREP136</italic> (lysozyme) were very highly up-regulated in all seven CSS patients. Another 28 genes were also up-regulated, albeit more moderately, and three were down-regulated in all CSS patients. The nature of these up- and down-regulated genes suggest that the immune systems of the patients are activated in response to invading microorganisms. These observations indicate that focused microarray analysis of PBMCs may be a practical, useful, and low-cost bedside diagnostics tool.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>focused microarray</kwd><kwd>RNA diagnosis</kwd><kwd>PMBC</kwd><kwd>allergic granulomatosis angiitis</kwd><kwd>Churg&#x02013;Strauss syndrome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The advent of array technology and the subsequent development of high-density oligonucleotide arrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM035C1">1</xref></sup> have been enormously helpful in improving our understanding of the genome-wide transcriptional profiles of many biological systems in both basic and applied research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM035C2">2</xref></sup> Array technology has also been extremely useful for discovering and developing diagnostic gene markers for disease subcategories, disease prognosis, and treatment outcome; this has paved the way for effective pharmaceutical drug discovery, the development of novel strategies for molecular (DNA, RNA) diagnostics, and the design of personalized drug regimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM035C2">2</xref></sup></p><p>Oligonucleotide microarrays, which were initially designed to analyze genome-wide gene expression levels, have turned out to be particularly useful in DNA diagnostics as they can be used for many different applications, including discovering polymorphisms and genotyping patients by identifying inheritable genetic markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM035C3">3</xref></sup> With regard to the latter applications, such DNA diagnostics have greatly improved our understanding of and ability to detect the causative mutations of various diseases. However, this technology is hampered by major ethical and privacy issues since the genome sequence of a person carries unchangeable private information whose discovery can affect the life of not only that person, but also to some extent their family members. The need to protect patient privacy upon DNA diagnostics testing and the practical problems this constitutes also imposes extra costs on the testing procedure. Moreover, many kinds of diseases are caused not only by the DNA polymorphism, but also by environmental status. These environmental factors can be reflected in the RNA status, but DNA diagnostics usually cannot provide enough information on the environments. Thus, the activity of the disease can be detected by RNA or protein level but not by DNA level.</p><p>These problems are not faced by RNA diagnostics, in which the genome-wide mRNA levels are monitored by oligonucleotide (or cDNA) microarrays. Ethical issues of the nature described above do not apply here because the information obtained from RNA diagnostics does not necessarily relate to the DNA sequence. Instead, this technology monitors the dynamic changes in gene activities, namely, the increased or decreased transcriptional (mRNA) levels in the samples provided by the individual. The transcriptional levels would vary in the same individual depending on the health of the individual. In this sense, DNA diagnostics is a static test of the genome, whereas RNA diagnostics is a dynamic test of the genome.</p><p>However, it is not possible to monitor all 44 000 kinds of mRNA species that are transcribed from the human genome for many samples at the same time. A novel way to circumvent this problem is to develop a &#x02018;focused array&#x02019; in which a limited number of mRNAs are tested in a low-density array. In the present study, we developed a focused oligonucleotide (or cDNA) array for use with patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). For this, we selected the genes that are predominantly expressed in normal PBMCs, as determined by stepwise subtractive hybridization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM035C4">4</xref></sup> and by genome-wide cDNA microarray analysis. From the 290 &#x02018;PBMC-focused&#x02019; genes we identified, we can prepare the PBMC-focused cDNA array. We examined the expression levels of these <italic>PREP</italic> genes to analyze the PBMC RNAs obtained from patients suffering the autoimmune disease Churg&#x02013;Strauss syndrome (CSS), which is an alternative name of allergic granulomatosis angiitis, because the autoimmune response of CSS patients is expected to disturb the expression levels of immune-related genes in PBMC. Indeed, we identified several genes whose expressions are markedly up- or down-regulated in all CSS patients tested. These observations suggest that this low-cost RNA diagnostics test is useful, practical, and can be used at the bedside.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Patients, Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Human subjects: patients and healthy controls</title><p>Blood was obtained from eight healthy volunteers (four males and four females; aged 25&#x02013;49 years) for the cDNA library preparation.

Briefly, after converting the PBMC cDNA library to a single-stranded form by transfection with f1 helper phage, we hybridized it with the biotinylated TIG-1 mRNAs and subtracted it by biotin&#x02013;avidin interactions.

An aliquot of each plasmid DNA was then digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Not</italic>I and their cDNA inserts were purified on 1% agarose gels and fluorescently labeled. These probes were then used in northern analysis to identify those genes whose transcript levels were much higher in PBMCs than in TIG-1 cells, namely, those genes that showed almost a plus/minus type difference. These genes were named <italic>PREP</italic> after predominantly expressed in PBMC. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSM035F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>, each northern sheet only included two lanes, one each for the RNAs extracted from PBMCs and TIG-1. The DNA sequences of these candidate <italic>PREP</italic> genes were determined from the 5&#x02032; end of the cDNA inserts by the dideoxy-chain termination reaction and were used to search the EST database by employing the BLAST algorithm (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/</uri>). For those candidate <italic>PREP</italic> genes whose northern blot signals were weak or undetectable, we examined whether these candidate genes were indeed up-regulated by RT&#x02013;PCR using oligonucleotide primers based on the DNA sequences of these genes (Supplementary Table S2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSM035F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).

The 399 genes that showed the greatest up-regulation in PBMCs compared with TIG-1 were then tested by RT&#x02013;PCR. This resulted in the identification of 126 <italic>PREP</italic> genes, 33 of which were the same as those obtained by the stepwise subtraction analysis. The candidate <italic>PREP</italic> genes were tested by northern and/or RT&#x02013;PCR analyses to confirm their PBMC-specifc expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSM035F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>).

Thus, it appears that while the stepwise subtraction method failed to identify 93 <italic>PREP</italic> genes, the DNA microarray analysis failed to detect 164 <italic>PREP</italic> genes. This disparity is mainly due to the differently sized drivers or probes used for hybridization; cDNA subtraction uses kilobase-order biotinylated mRNA as the driver for subtraction, while DNA microarrays are probed by 60-base oligonucleotides.
