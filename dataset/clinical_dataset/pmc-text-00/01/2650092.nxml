The growth inhibition of a species in filter paper bioassay enriched with a single chemical is commonly interpreted as evidence of an allelopathic interaction, but for some of these putative examples of allelopathy, the results have not been verifiable in more natural settings with plants growing in soil.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal findings</title><p>On the basis of filter paper bioassay, a recent study established allelopathic effects of m-tyrosine, a component of root exudates of <italic>Festuca rubra</italic> ssp. <italic>commutata</italic>. We re-examined the allelopathic effects of m-tyrosine to understand its dynamics in soil environment. Allelopathic potential of m-tyrosine with filter paper and soil (non-sterile or sterile) bioassays was studied using <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic>, <italic>Phalaris minor</italic> and <italic>Bambusa arundinacea</italic> as assay species. Experimental application of m-tyrosine to non-sterile and sterile soil revealed the impact of soil microbial communities in determining the soil concentration of m-tyrosine and growth responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Here, we show that the allelopathic effects of m-tyrosine, which could be seen in sterilized soil with particular plant species were significantly diminished when non-sterile soil was used, which points to an important role for rhizosphere-specific and bulk soil microbial activity in determining the outcome of this allelopathic interaction. Our data show that the amounts of m-tyrosine required for root growth inhibition were higher than what would normally be found in <italic>F. rubra</italic> ssp. <italic>commutata</italic> rhizosphere. We hope that our study will motivate researchers to integrate the role of soil microbial communities in bioassays in allelopathic research so that its importance in plant-plant competitive interactions can be thoroughly evaluated.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the fascinating but controversial processes in plant ecology is the mediation of competitive interactions among plants by plant-released metabolites, a mechanism referred to as &#x0201c;allelopathy.&#x0201d; In spite of the established role of soil microbial communities in interfering with the allelopathic activity of a metabolite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004700-Ito1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004700-Shaw1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, most studies use bioassays that do not incorporate a microbial component in their experimental designs.

The lower recovery of m-tyrosine in bamboo soil could be due to either temperature-dependent non-microbial degradation, temperature-dependent microbial degradation or rhizosphere-specific microbial activity in bamboo rhizosphere. The lack of significant differences in m-tyrosine recovery from sterile soil at 22 or 30&#x000b0;C ruled out temperature-dependent non-microbial degradation of m-tyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004700-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p>Since measuring soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux is a reliable technique for comparing microbial activity in different soils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004700-Haney1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, we measured CO<sub>2</sub> release in untreated and m-tyrosine-treated soil incubated at 22 or 30&#x000b0;C. We observed a higher CO<sub>2</sub> release in the untreated soil incubated at 30&#x000b0;C (4&#x000b1;0.2 &#x000b5;g CO<sub>2</sub> released/g soil/h) compared to 22&#x000b0;C (2.6&#x000b1;0.6 &#x000b5;g CO<sub>2</sub> released/g soil/h). A higher m-tyrosine recovery of 12.1, 22.1, 29.7 and 40.3&#x00025; was observed in non-sterile soil treated with 17, 34, 68 or 136 &#x000b5;g m-tyrosine/g soil at 22&#x000b0;C compared to 0, 13.1, 18.5 or 21.8&#x00025;, respectively in m-tyrosine treated soil at 30&#x000b0;C. The lower recovery was associated with higher CO<sub>2</sub> efflux suggesting higher microbial activity in soil treated with 17 (47.4&#x00025;), 34 (59.1&#x00025;), 68 (81.1&#x00025;) or 136 (61.4&#x00025;) &#x000b5;g m-tyrosine/g soil at 30&#x000b0;C compared to respective soils incubated at 22&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004700-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) as others have found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004700-Qiu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the effects were not strictly concentration-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004700-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). When incubated at 22&#x000b0;C, soil treated with 4.25 &#x000b5;g m-tyrosine/g had a higher CO<sub>2</sub> release (except from the soil treated with 8.5 &#x000b5;g m-tyrosine/g soil) compared to soil treated with 17, 34, 68 or 136 &#x000b5;g m-tyrosine/g soil at 22&#x000b0;C. No differences in the CO<sub>2</sub> release were observed among soils treated with 17, 34, 68 or 136 &#x000b5;g m-tyrosine/g soil at 22&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004700-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Negative impacts of m-tyrosine on <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp. and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004700-Aronson1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004700-Aronson2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, which to some extent explain the dome-shaped curve for microbial activity at 22&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004700-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). It may be possible that increased nitrogen availability in response to m-tyrosine addition allows particular soil bacteria to grow better at low m-tyrosine concentrations, but higher concentrations inhibit bacterial growth and CO<sub>2</sub> release. This aspect, however, needs further experimental evidence. Higher microbial activity in soil incubated at 30&#x000b0;C likely accounts for the more rapid degradation of m-tyrosine and the disappearance of phytotoxic effects to bamboo. Since the recovery of m-tyrosine in non-sterile soils with and without bamboo did not differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004700-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), the possibility that bamboo rhizosphere-specific microbial activity was involved is unlikely. When bamboo was grown in non-sterile soil treated with 34, 68 or 136 &#x000b5;g m-tyrosine/g soil, m-tyrosine recovery was 12.1, 15.6 or 18.1&#x00025; respectively, compared to 13.1, 18.5 or 21.8&#x00025; in non-sterile soil without bamboo. When non-sterile soil without littleseed canarygrass or lettuce was treated with 17, 34, 68 or 136 &#x000b5;g m-tyrosine/g soil, the recovery was 12.1, 22.1, 29.7 or 40.3&#x00025;, respectively. However, the recoveries decreased when non-sterile soil with lettuce (0, 11.3, 18.1or 31.1&#x00025;, respectively) or littleseed canarygrass (0, 10.3, 18.7 or 34.1&#x00025;, respectively) were measured. Hence there is a possibility of rhizosphere-specific microbial breakdown in the rhizosphere of lettuce and littleseed canarygrass. Rhizospheres are known to harbor microbial populations specific to a particular cultivar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004700-Ruiyu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> and this specificity should be incorporated in the allelopathy bioassays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004700-Foy1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004700-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We did not detect m-tyrosine in non-sterile soils with 3, 6 or 9 seedlings of <italic>F. rubra</italic> ssp. <italic>commutata</italic>.

Moreover, it is difficult to collect root surface washings in a system without causing physical damage to the roots, which is unlikely to occur in the artificial soil system. In natural conditions, biotic stresses such as herbivory, however, might cause a local release of m-tyrosine.
