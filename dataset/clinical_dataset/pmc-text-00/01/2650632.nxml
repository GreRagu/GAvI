Genes with similar expression patterns can be assumed to be co-regulated at the transcriptional level by promoter sequences with a similar structure. Current approaches for modeling shared regulatory features tend to focus mainly on clustering of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sites. Here we introduce a Markov chain-based promoter structure model that uses both shared motifs and shared features from an input set of promoter sequences to predict candidate genes with similar expression. The model uses positional preference, order, and orientation of motifs. The trained model is used to score a genomic set of promoter sequences: high-scoring promoters are assumed to have a structure similar to the input sequences and are thus expected to drive similar expression patterns. We applied our model on two datasets in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and in <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>. Both computational and experimental verifications indicate that this model is capable of predicting candidate promoters driving similar expression patterns as the input-regulatory sequences. This model can be useful for finding promising candidate genes for wet-lab experiments and for increasing our understanding of transcriptional regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>regulation of transcription</kwd><kwd>Markov chain</kwd><kwd>promoter modeling</kwd><kwd><italic>in situ</italic> hybridization</kwd><kwd>transcription factor binding site</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene expression in metazoans is regulated at many levels. Regulation of transcription is the first step in the cascade of regulation and is thus of great importance for our understanding of gene expression. Regulation of transcription is determined by the binding of transcription factors (TFs) to their corresponding TF binding sites (TFBSs), and regulatory sequences containing similar sets of TFBSs are expected to be under the control of similar sets of TFs and drive similar expression patterns. Hence, the identification of TFBSs has become a key factor in unraveling the transcriptional regulation mystery. Unfortunately, the identification of these <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements by wet-lab experiments is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Computational methods have come to the rescue, but both their sensitivity and selectivity are severely hampered by the nature of the target motifs: TFBSs tend to be short (typically six to 15 bp) and degenerate, while the sequence in which they are located can be over 10 kb in length. Looking only at the oligonucleotide sequence recognized by a TF, we can expect a number of biologically meaningless occurrences in almost every promoter sequence. The most popular way of modeling TFBSs is by position weight matrices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C1">1</xref></sup> However, this assumes that the positions within the motifs contribute to the binding affinity in an independent manner. Recent experimental evidence has shown that this assumption is not accurate, and a number of models incorporating position-dependencies have been proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C6">6</xref></sup></p><p>There is growing evidence that TFs do not work alone, but rather cooperate to confer a specific spatio-temporal expression pattern; for instance, TFs bind to sites located in close proximity to each other, the so-called <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules (CRMs). It is, therefore, not surprising that many approaches to improve the accuracy of tissue expression prediction have focused on clustered groups of predicted binding sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C14">14</xref></sup> Zhao et al., for example, predicted regulatory modules in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> based on the clustering of a set of motifs correlating with muscle-specific gene expression. Clusters are defined simply as sites of the motifs positioned within a certain distance from each other. Blanchette et al. described a more complex approach where large numbers of PWMs are used to find statistically significant clusters of phylogenetically conserved sites in windows of 100 to 2000 bp. However, focusing only on clustered groups of predicted binding sites might be too simplistic an approach to the problem of TFBS detection and regulatory region architecture modeling. First, most of these approaches do not take into account solitary sites at all, even though some of them are likely to be functional. Secondly, in many CRM-modeling approaches, additional features of TFBSs, such as orientation, positional bias with respect to the transcription or translation start site, and order are ignored, although a number of studies have illustrated the importance of these features for some TFBSs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C17">17</xref></sup> In a genome-wide analysis of TFBSs in the mouse genome, Sharov et al. found that a considerable number of TFBSs showed a significant bias in their orientation. Berendzen et al. studied the importance of position and orientation of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and promoter motifs in a number of species. Their results show that several known functional elements appear to be relatively enriched at defined sites in the promoter region. Terai and Takagi showed that it is possible to find motif combinations in yeast that are significantly associated with a certain expression profile if their order is restricted, whereas they are not associated if their order is not taken into account. Methods that have tried to use such features are few in number. The Dragon Promoter Mapper uses a number of motif features such as the orientation, the order, and distances between adjacent motifs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C18">18</xref></sup> However, the distance to the transcription or translation start site is not taken into account, and the model might have difficulties with motifs that lack a conserved distance between their sites showing a general preference for a certain region within the promoter region. Methods as the one described by Ohler et al. use more diverse physical properties such as DNA bendability, GC content, or stacking energy in addition to predicted TATA-boxes and initiator sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C19">19</xref></sup> These methods, however, need hundreds of training sequences and focus only on the core promoter region, where the distances between functional elements are strongly conserved. In addition, the final goal of these programs is fundamentally different from ours. While we predict the promoters with a similar architecture as an input set of promoters, they merely predict the presence or absence of a promoter.</p><p>We introduce here a simple Markov chain-based promoter architecture model as an alternative to the existing CRM models. Our model is trained using an input set of promoter sequences and captures information about the orientation, the positional bias, and the order of predicted occurrences of motifs that are over-represented in the input sequences. Subsequently, the trained model is used to predict genes having similar expression patterns.</p><p>We applied our model to two promoter sequence datasets: a set of promoter sequences driving expression in pharyngeal muscle cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and a set of muscle-specific promoters in <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>. The muscle system of <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been extensively studied, and the regulatory regions and expression patterns of a number of genes are relatively well known. <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> is a chordate model organism that has shown to be very useful for the study of developmental and evolutionary biology, and recently a number of studies have focused on the transcriptional regulation of muscle-specific genes in this organism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C23">23</xref></sup> The availability of relatively well-annotated expression information for <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the recent interest in the <italic>Ciona</italic> muscle regulatory system have determined the choice of our datasets. For both sets we trained the model and used it to predict new candidate promoters with similar expression patterns as the input promoter sequences. Finally, our predictions were verified for their accuracy, using both available annotation data and new wet-lab experiments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Selection of input sequence datasets</title><p>The genomic set of <italic>C. elegans</italic> promoter sequences was obtained from WormMart (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/">http://www.wormbase.org/</uri>, WormBase Release WS170).

Finally, only motifs having a length between 6 and 15 bp and having more than five predicted occurrences in their input dataset were considered. Motifs that were obvious repeats (AT-repeats, AT-rich stretches, etc.) were removed. We further removed redundant motifs and selected up to 10 motifs that showed to be the most significantly over-represented in the input promoter sequences. This final set of motifs for each set of input promoter sequences was then used for further analysis and to construct the promoter architecture model.</p><p>To model the binding site preferences of each motif, we used a variable-order Bayesian network (VOBN), based on a method described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C29">29</xref></sup> Basically, a VOBN model can be regarded as a PWM, with the only difference that a first-order dependency between positions in the motif is allowed. In this study, we have set the conditions for introducing a dependency very strict. Because of this, the majority of positions in the VOBN are of zero-th order, which implies that many motifs are basically modeled as PWMs. Only in cases where a strong dependency was found, a first-order dependency between the positions was introduced (see Supplementary Material Section 3). To model the background nucleotide frequencies of the promoter sequences, both for <italic>C. elegans</italic> and for <italic>C. intestinalis</italic>, an interpolated Markov model (IMM) was trained from the genomic set of promoter sequences of each organism. This was done using the procedure described by Salzberg et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C30">30</xref></sup> The IMM we used here is at most of eighth order. However, in cases where training data is scarce, an interpolation is made with a lower order. Thus the IMM takes advantage of the greater accuracy of higher-order models and, at the same time, avoids the problem of over-fitting caused by insufficient training data.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><label>2.3.</label><title>Positional bias and promoter sequence partitioning</title><p>Using the final set of motifs, for each dataset we scanned the input sequences for occurrences of each motif and represented them visually. As is discussed in the Results and discussion section, in many cases the occurrences of a motif show a certain tendency to appear in a certain region of the promoter sequences. Often, this is the region proximal to the transcription or translational start site; in other cases, it is a region further upstream. Keeping this heterogeneity in mind, it would be unwise to make one single model for the entire promoter structure, not taking into consideration the positional bias of some motifs.</p><p>Hughes et al. have introduced a measure for the degree of positional bias <italic>P</italic> for a motif,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C28">28</xref></sup> as calculated by Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="DSM034M1">1</xref>).<disp-formula id="DSM034M1"><label>1</label><graphic xlink:href="dsm03403.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula>where <italic>t</italic> is the total number of predicted sites of a motif in the input promoter sequences, <italic>m</italic> is the number of sites in a window of size <italic>w</italic> bp that contains the greatest number of sites, <italic>w</italic> is set to 300 bp, and <italic>s</italic> is the average size of the input sequences (typically 2000 &#x0003c; <italic>s</italic> &#x0003c; 3000). <italic>P</italic> is a measure of the likelihood of observing by chance more occurrences than the observed number in the densest region of the promoter sequences, given the total number of occurrences of the motif per unit of sequence length. The lower the value, the more significantly the motif is biased in its positional distribution. Given the values of this positional bias score of all motifs for each data set, we can split the promoter structure model into two regions in such a way that more positionally biased motifs will be present mainly in one region, and not in the other. For example, the border between the two regions can be set at 500 bp upstream of the translation start site for all promoter sequences. This could be done a number of times, resulting in an arbitrarily large number of regions, but in this study, we limited the regions to just two: a proximal and a distal one.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><label>2.4.</label><title>Model training</title><p>First-order Markov chains were trained for both the proximal and distal region of the input sequences, and similarly for a set of negative control sequences. Since in practice for many organisms there is little to no information available on tissue-specific expression, the entire set of genomic promoter sequences with their predicted sites was used as negative control set. The conditional probabilities of the Markov chains will be denoted as<disp-formula id="DSM034M2"><label>2</label><graphic xlink:href="dsm03404.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula>where <italic>set</italic> stands either for the input set of promoters and their predicted sites or for the non-input set of promoters and their predicted sites, and <italic>region</italic> stands for the proximal or distal region of the promoters. <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> represent over-represented motifs or a &#x02018;start&#x02019; or &#x02018;stop&#x02019; state representing the beginning and the end of the region, and <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> their respective orientation. For the &#x02018;start&#x02019; and &#x02018;stop&#x02019; states, orientation is not taken into account. The conditional probability of Equation <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="DSM034M2">2</xref> is the chance to observe a site of a certain motif <italic>B</italic> in a certain orientation <italic>y</italic>, after a site of a certain motif <italic>A</italic> in a certain orientation <italic>x</italic> in the particular region of set. The direction in this process is always from the 3&#x02032; end toward the 5&#x02032; end; the chance of finding find &#x02018;start&#x02019; after &#x02018;end&#x02019; is not included as it is not relevant. The conditional probabilities are learned from the predicted sites of the motifs in the respective regions of both the input and background promoter sequences. From the corresponding probabilities of the input and background sequences, we can calculate a log likelihood ratio (LLR) as<disp-formula id="DSM034M3"><label>3</label><graphic xlink:href="dsm03405.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula>for each region. Naturally, if the chance of observing a site of motif <italic>B</italic> in an orientation <italic>y</italic> after a site of motif <italic>A</italic> in orientation <italic>x</italic> is higher in the input than in the non-input promoters, this LLR will have a high positive value, indicating that this transition is more characteristic for the input sequences than for the non-input sequences. Conversely, if the chance of observing a site of motif <italic>B</italic> in an orientation <italic>y</italic> after a site of motif <italic>A</italic> in orientation <italic>x</italic> is lower in the input than in the non-input, this LLR will have a high negative value, indicating that this transition is less characteristic for the input sequences than for the non-input sequences. If multiple sites of a motif are present in a region, each of them makes a contribution to the score of the region. The addition of pseudocounts was used to avoid over-fitting for motifs with a low number of occurrences.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><label>2.5.</label><title>Scoring promoter sequences</title><p>For each promoter sequence to score, we took the regions with their motif sequence (from 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032;) and the LLR values corresponding to the particular region.

Of the 20 input promoters, 11 were in the 100 top-scoring sequences (see Supplementary Material Section 5). To verify the validity of this prediction, we used the expression annotation that can be found in WormBase. For the 100 highest scoring non-input genes having a tissue expression annotation (the first one being ranked 30th, the last one 606th out of 24 446 promoters), we determined which tissues were statistically over-represented. We found that the 100 top-scoring annotated non-input genes are enriched for genes expressed in pharyngeal muscles (10 genes, 4.1 expected by chance, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.0025) and muscle tissue in general (42 genes, 30.9 expected by chance, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.0072). There was also a slight enrichment for genes expressed in motor neurons (7 genes, 2.4 expected by chance, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.0110), which are involved in the regulation of muscle contractions. It is not surprising to find the top-scoring genes to be enriched for not only pharyngeal muscle cells, but also muscle tissues in general, as the input genes&#x02019; tissue expression patterns were not restricted to only pharyngeal muscle cells but also included other muscle tissues. <xref ref-type="table" rid="DSM034TB2">Table&#x000a0;2</xref> shows the 10 top-scoring annotated non-input genes and their expression annotation as reported on WormBase.

It is known that muscle genes and neuronal genes share some regulatory elements, and other studies have reported similar observations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM034C34">34</xref></sup></p><table-wrap id="DSM034TB2" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>The ten highest scoring non-input promoters for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> pharyngeal muscle promoter model, with their rank, sequence and transcript name and reported expression pattern</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rank</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sequence name</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Transcript name</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Expression pattern as annotated on WormBase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Y24D9A.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Y24D9A.4a.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nervous system, reproductive system, anal depressor muscle, body wall muscle, pharynx</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">47</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">F52C9.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">F52C9.8e</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nervous system, intestine</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T13C5.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">T13C5.1a</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Head neurons, hypodermis, vulval muscle, anterior ganglia, spermathecae</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">72</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">D1081.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">D1081.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stomato-intestinal muscle, anal depressor muscle, body wall muscle</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">75</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">F22B7.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">F22B7.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">E lineage, syncytial hypoderm</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">79</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C53C11.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C53C11.3</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Head neurons, ventral nerve cord, tail neurons, nervous system</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">80</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">F10E9.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">F10E9.6a.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nervous system, reproductive system, body wall muscle, pharyngeal neurons, anal depressor muscle, vulval muscle</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">83</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ZK652.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ZK652.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Head neurons, nervous system, intestine, tail neurons</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">84</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C36E6.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C36E6.5.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pharynx, pharyngeal muscle</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">86</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R07B1.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R07B1.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ventral cord motor neurons, seam cells, hypodermal, neuroblasts, head</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Of these ten promoters five drive expression in one or more muscle tissues, one specifically in pharyngeal muscles.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s3b"><label>3.2.</label><title>C. intestinalis muscle promoter architecture model</title><p>We predicted over-represented motifs in a set of 19 <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> promoter sequences known to drive expression in <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> muscle tissue. <xref ref-type="table" rid="DSM034TB3">Table&#x000a0;3</xref> shows the positional bias scores of the detected over-represented motifs.

Sequences in which we could not find a TATA-box within a reasonable distance of the coding region were anchored at the position 100 bp upstream of the translation start site. Given the preference of some motifs for the proximal region, the promoter architecture model was partitioned into a proximal part (from the translation start site to 250 bp upstream of the predicted TATA-box) and a distal part (from 250 bp upstream of the predicted TATA-box until the 5&#x02032; end of the promoter sequence).

As this model does not directly model the clustering of motifs, it can be considered as an alternative to the existing CRM-based models. During the training of the model, only one parameter needs to be set (i.e. the position of the boundary between the regions). We did not use any tissue-specific or organism-specific information in the construction of the model, so we can expect it to be applicable in other tissues and organisms as well. The fact that we could successfully predict expression profiles in two organisms illustrates the general applicability of our approach. Moreover, the motifs we used in the two datasets and described here were based solely on computational predictions, illustrating that this method does not require prior knowledge of the regulatory factors involved and their binding sites. Apart from a set of promoter sequences of co-regulated genes no other input data are needed. However, the structure of promoters driving expression in other tissues, such as the photoreceptor in <italic>C. intestinalis</italic>, has shown to be more challenging. Improvements to the model, such as the incorporation of additional information (e.g. the clustering of sites, the distance between pairs of sites, or evolutionary conservation) are likely to improve its prediction performance and are now being studied.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary data are available online at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org">www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org</uri>.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from JSPS (17310114) and was supported in part by another grant (18370089) and by BIRD of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).
