INTRODUCTION</title><p>Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common finding in children with urinarytract infections (UTIs). The incidenceof VUR associated with UTIs drops significantly in older children, particularlyafter the age of 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It has been a long-held dogma of pediatric urology thatunresolved VUR should be treated before a child progresses throughpuberty. There is concern that femaleswith uncorrected VUR will have problems with pyelonephritis when they becomesexually active and during pregnancy. Pyelonephritisduring pregnancy increases the risks of the pregnancy and possibly to theunborn child as well. If these childrenhave their reflux corrected before they go through puberty, these problemscould be prevented. While in theory this justifies the surgical correction ofall children who fail to resolve their reflux during a period of observation,there is little evidence to support treating all children and no long-termstudies documenting the natural history of uncorrected VUR after puberty. This manuscript will review the associationof VUR and UTIs in patients treated after puberty and examine the role,nuances, and outcomes of treating VUR after puberty.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. CLINICAL IMPORTANCE OF VUR AFTER PUBERTY</title><p>There hasbeen a long-standing observation of the association of febrile UTIs and thedevelopment of renal scarring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The riskiest time for the development ofrenal scarring due to febrile UTI associated with primary VUR is infancy andthe risk of developing new scars drops significantly after age of 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It isstill common to follow and treat patients beyond this age. While severescarring may predispose to chronic kidney disease in a small percentage(estimated at 2%), the majority of children with VUR are not at significantrisk for renal failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There is a higher incidence of hypertension inpatients with renal scarring, but severe complications due to VUR areunusual. The only reliable benefit topatients who's VUR is surgically corrected is a decreased risk ofpyelonephritis, but the incidence of UTIs is similar to those who reflux haspersisted. These findings have led someto consider stopping antibiotic prophylaxis in selected children and ceasing surveillance for resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">6</xref>]. Voiding cystourethrograms (VCUG) can be perceived as traumatic by children andsimplifying their follow-up and avoiding these tests may be a major factor indiscontinuing follow-up for some parents. As a result of these practices more and more physicians are going toallow children with persistent VUR to continue through puberty with uncorrectedVUR. As a group, these patients willlikely have lower grades of VUR, infrequent UTIs, and normal renal function. There are currently no longitudinal studies documenting just what risks thesepatients will face and whether their VUR will be a significant problem duringadolescences and adulthood. It is likely that some of these patients will havefuture problems with UTIs and be considered for treatment of their VUR afterpuberty.</p><p>There has also been a change in VUR management by some pediatric urologists that is thepolar opposite of stopping prophylaxis and observing patients. Instead offollowing patients for resolution of their VUR, primary therapy with endoscopicinjections after the diagnosis of VUR is being offered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">7</xref>]. Touted as aminimally invasive alternative, the &#x0201c;15-minute cure&#x0201d; is being used as upfronttherapy in patients after diagnosis to avoid the need to prolonged antibioticprophylaxis and prolonged follow-up while waiting for the VUR to resolve. While success rates greater than 90% arereported by experienced surgeons, the follow-up in these series is generallyshort with VCUGs being performed usually within 3 months of the procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">8</xref>]. There is a known rate of relapse for thismethod which is highest for collagen, and was reported to be greater than 50%at 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">9</xref>]. The relapse rate is lower for other agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">11</xref>]. If thereis a 10&#x02013;15% relapse over 5&#x02013;10 years (areasonable estimate given the few long-term studies available) it is likely thatthere will be increasing numbers of late failures of endoscopic therapy. Ofthese patients, some will present after puberty with pyelonephritis andrecurrent VUR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec3"><title>3. VUR AND UTIs AFTER PUBERTY</title><p>The primary motivation for treatmentof VUR before puberty has been over concerns of increased risk of UTIs whenfemale patients become sexually active or pregnant. To my knowledge, however, the natural historyof women with persistent VUR during pregnancy has not been documented. Pyelonephritis is a known risk to pregnantwomen and strongly associated with bacteruria. Large series have reported rates of 2% of pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">12</xref>]. Inpregnant women with a history of VUR or surgically corrected VUR, higher ratesof UTIs and pyelonephritis have been reported. Mansfield et al. reported complications during pregnancy for patients who had undergone surgicalcorrection of VUR and a group with a history of VUR that did not undergosurgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">13</xref>]. The rate of cystitis andpyelonephritis was 22% and 18%, respectively, during pregnancy for the patientswith surgically corrected VUR. These rates were higher than the patientswithout treatment of their VUR with cystitis in 15% and pyelonephritis in1.5%. They also reported a high rate ofUTIs with the onset of sexual activity in 75% of patients with surgicallytreated VUR and 62% of those with a history of VUR that was not treated. There is a significantly increased risk ofUTIs in women with a history of VUR. There could be multiple explanations for the differences in the twogroups including that the surgical procedure is the cause of the increasedUTIs. Due to the retrospective nature however, the authors point out that thisobservation of higher rates of UTIs in the surgically treated patients does notprove that the problem is due to the surgery. Other factors may be responsible for these differences, such asselection bias. These patients likely had an increased susceptibility to UTIs,which is likely what pushed them to surgical correction in the firstplace. The authors recommend thatpregnant women with a history of ureteral reimplantation surgery undergofrequent screening for bacteruria during pregnancy and that prophylacticantibiotics be considered in these patients. Other series of long-term follow-up of patients with VUR treated withureteral reimplantation surgery have similar findings. Beetz etal. reported a 25-year follow up in 158 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">14</xref>]. Female patientsreported subsequent UTIs in 74% after surgery versus 10% of males. 17%developed UTIs during pregnancy, however, they did not report whether thesepatients had pyelonephritis or cystitis. Of the UTIs, most (66%) were afebrileversus preoperatively where the UTIs were febrile. It remains unknown as towhether patients experiencing continued problems with UTIs after surgery wouldhave fewer problems if they had not undergone surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec4"><title>4. WHICH PATIENTS SHOULD BEEVALUATED AND TREATED?</title><p>The incidence of VUR after pubertyis significantly lower than in young infants with febrile UTIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It has beenwell established that VUR is a risk factor for pyelonephritis and that itfrequently is present as one of several risk factors for UTIs. Voiding dysfunction must always be consideredin this patient population and treated appropriately. With proper treatment andmodification of risk factors such as infrequent voiding, dysfunctional voiding,constipation, and incomplete emptying the VUR may be eliminated withoutsurgical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">15</xref>].</p><p>Most postpubertal patients with VUR will present with UTIs. Since the majority of patients will not haveVUR and assuming that VUR is an important risk factor for pyelonephritis, whatare the factors that should prompt an evaluation for VUR in a postpubertalpatient? First and foremost should be a history of recurrent febrile urinarytract infections, as these patients if found to have reflux, have a good chanceof having their symptoms alleviated if VUR is found and treated. Suspicionshould be raised if there is a history of prior VUR, febrile infections as ayoung child, or a family history of VUR. Due to the high association of renal scarring and VUR, patients who havea history of recurrent febrile UTIs and evidence of renal scarring on imagingstudies should be evaluated for VUR. To evaluate for VUR a standard VUCG may beperformed, or if there are symptoms worrisome for voiding dysfunction avideourodynamics study. In patients with evidence of renal scarring or a smallkidney on ultrasound, a DMSA renal scan should be obtained to evaluate forrenal scarring and the differential function. Typically, the grade of VUR is an important factor for predictingresolution and risk of renal scarring; however, in postpubertal patients it hasnot been studied as extensively. It is expected that the rates of spontaneousresolution will be lower after puberty.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec5"><title>5. SURGICAL TREATMENT OF VUR AFTER PUBERTY</title><p>One of the more humbling experiences for a pediatric urologist is their first ureteralreimplantation done on a female after puberty. These difficulties start asfemales approach puberty. During puberty, the pelvis widens and deepens in thefemale. The trigone assumes a deeper retropubic location which makes access tothe ureteral orifices and the mobilization of the ureters more difficult. Additionally, the plexus of vein running across the surface of the bladder enlarge and are more proneto troublesome bleeding during ureteral dissection. Though not well documented,most pediatric urologists would agree that, if a child truly needed ureteralreimplantation for correction of their VUR, then the operation is bestperformed if they are operated on during childhood rather than after puberty. Experience would tell us that they recover quicker and that technically thesurgery should be more successful, however, there are not series documentingpoorer results after ureteral reimplantation for patients treated afterpuberty. Options for treatment of VUR inpatients after puberty include intra- or extra-vesical ureteral reimplantation,endoscopic injection, and laparoscopic or robotic reimplantation. In patients with unilateral VUR to a poorlyfunctioning kidney nephrectomy may be an alternative choice to ureteralreimplantation. This can be performed laparoscopically with rapid recovery andshort hospitalization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec6"><title>6. URETERAL REIMPLANTATION</title><p>As mentioned previously, the postpubertal changes in women make the surgical access to thetrigone more challenging and limit exposure; however, ureteral reimplantationcan be performed in women successfully. In males, the changes are less dramatic. Published results of ureteral reimplantation in postpubertal patientsare sparse due to the limited number of patients in whom this surgery isindicated. From a technical standpoint,it is prudent to position the patient over the break in the OR table. This allowsthe table to be flexed if necessary to open the pelvis and improve retropubicexposure. This is similar to thepositioning of a male undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy. The size and body mass index will play a rolewith obese patients creating more difficulties with exposure. Proper surgicalplanning and the use of larger and more flexible fixed retractors such as aBookwalter rather than the Denis-Browne retractor will facilitate theprocedure. Both ureteral advancements and ureteroneocystotomy procedures (e.g.,Cohen, Glenn-Anderson, and Politano-Leadbetter) can be performed but limiteddata is available on their use in the treatment of VUR postpuberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">20</xref>]. There havebeen reports of the use of trigonoplasty (Gil-Vernet) procedures, which inpostpubertal patients offer the advantage of less dissection and mobilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">22</xref>]. Success rates of up to 97% have been reported but follow-up is limited to only11 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec7"><title>7. ENDOSCOPIC INJECTION</title><p>Although controversy remains about the role of endoscopic injection for VUR as analternative to ureteral reimplantation in young children, there are few&#x0201c;reimplanters&#x0201d; who would completely dismiss this option in patients afterpuberty. This technique has been practiced for over 20 years and a variety of bulkingagents have been injected including polytetrafluoroethylene paste,gluteraldehyde cross-linked bovine collagen, polydimethysiloxane, and detranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (D/HA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">23</xref>]. In the UnitedStates the D/HA copolymer is the only agent that has been FDA approved for usein children. A recent series by Okeke etal. reported 9 women (mean age of 26) with symptomatic VUR associatedwith acute pyelonephritis who were treated endoscopically with D/HA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">24</xref>]. Allwere treated successfully with no reflux by VCUGs at 3 months postoperatively,although 1 did require a second injection for persistent VUR. Two patients hadtransient flank pain immediately postoperatively which resolved after a fewdays. At a mean follow-up of 14 months, none of the patients had furtherinfections or symptoms. In children, the treatment of VUR with D/HA injectionshas been associated with a lower incidence of UTIs postoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">25</xref>]. It isunknown whether or not postpubertal patients are at the same risk for latefailures of endoscopic injection as was described in some of the originalseries of children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec8"><title>8. LAPAROSCOPIC AND ROBOTICURETERAL REIMPLANTATION</title><p>Minimally invasive ureteral reimplantation for VUR has been performed for over a decade;however its widespread uses have been slow to spread. Proponents oflaparoscopic surgery would cite the limited laparoscopic experience of mostpediatric urologists as a primary factor for this slow adaptation. However,many would argue against relearning to do a procedure which has rapid recovery,high success rate, low complication rate, and is done through an inconspicuousincision. A low, transverse abdominal incision leaves a scar that often blendsinto the natural creases of the abdominal skin leaving a barely visible mark. Ifplaced low enough it is covered by undergarments and is not disfiguring. Giventhe questionable benefits and technical difficulties the laparoscopic techniquehas been slow to gain acceptance. Onepopulation where this approach actually may be a real asset is in treating VURafter puberty.</p><p>Both intra- and extra-vesical laparoscopic techniques for reimplantation have been described in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">28</xref>]. In thepostpubertal female, the advantage for laparoscopy is that the scope andinstruments can reach deep into the pelvis with good visualization. Shu etal. reported a series of laparoscopic extravesical reimplantationsperformed for VUR in postpubertal females at a mean age of 18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">29</xref>]. One patientunderwent bilateral and the other 5 unilateral reimplantation. 1 patient hadtransient ureteral obstruction requiring a temporary stent placement. All hadresolution of their VUR postoperatively.</p><p>Robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery has become a widely practiced urologic techniquefor performing radical prostatectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">30</xref>]. The surgeons utilizing the robot forprostatectomies tout the increased magnification, 3D visualization, andprecision movements the wristed instruments as advantages over the opensurgical procedure. The neurovascularbundles are well visualized, as is the apical dissection of the prostate andurethra. Performing deep pelvic surgery such as ureteral reimplantation inpostpubertal patients is a situation where the robotic approach may have anadvantage over traditional open surgical reimplantation. There are limitedreports of robotic ureteral reimplantations being performed in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">31</xref>]. The robot allows a surgeon with good open surgical skills to perform complexlaparoscopic procedures. Extravesical ureteral reimplantation has been associatedwith postoperative urinary retention when performed bilaterally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">32</xref>]. This is felt to be due to injury to the pelvicplexus during the dissection of the ureter extravesically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">33</xref>]. Casale etal. reported a series of 41 children with a mean age of 33 monthstreated with bilateral robotic &#x0201c;nerve-sparing&#x0201d; extravesical reimplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">34</xref>]. All children voided well after catheterremoval on postoperative day number 1. No patient had retention as documentedby ultrasonic bladder scanning. Reflux was cured in 97% and no ureters wereobstructed. If these impressive results can be achieved by other surgeons andapplied to postpubertal patients, this could become the preferred approach to ureteralreimplantation surgery after puberty.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec9"><title>9. CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The natural history of untreated VURin postpubertal patients is unknown. Treatment of VUR should be considered in those patients with VUR andrecurrent febrile UTIs. The optimal method to treat VUR is not clear. Endoscopic injection is a minimally invasive approach which has a good successrate for treating VUR and offers some benefits over ureteral reimplantation. The role of laparoscopic and robotic ureteral reimplantation is evolving andmay offer some advantages over open ureteral reimplantation in postpubertalpatients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref
