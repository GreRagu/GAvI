Currently, the use of LV vectors is commonplace and applications in the fields of neuroscience, hematology, developmental biology, stem cell biology and transgenesis have emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. LV vectors are also being pursued in a number of clinical trials (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gemcris.od.nih.gov/"/>). Despite significant progress, the production and concentration of high-titer, high-quality LV vectors for preclinical studies in animal models is still cumbersome and costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The production of LV vectors is typically carried out using transient transfection approaches involving tissue culture dishes or flasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], cell factories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], or stirred-tank bioreactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These protocols are cumbersome to scale up (dishes, flasks) or technically challenging (cell factories, bioreactors), preventing their routine use in a standard laboratory setting.</p><p>Typical LV vector titers involving the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein range from 10<sup>6 </sup>to 10<sup>8 </sup>TU/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Higher titers can be achieved by physical concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], including ultracentrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], or filtration approaches such as ultrafiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and diafiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Vector production for large-scale <italic>in vivo </italic>applications in animal models requiring high-titer LV vector stocks is challenging due to the lack of simple procedures allowing rapid processing of large volumes of LV vector-containing cell culture supernatants. The traditional ultracentrifugation-based methods are limited in terms of their capacity to handle large volumes, thus making this procedure extremely tedious. Filtration approaches such as diafiltration are well suited for processing large volumes of vector supernatants. However, they are difficult to implement in a standard laboratory setting. Thus, there is an emerging need for simple and less laborious procedures that result in a rapid reduction of the volume of the cell culture supernatant to be processed without the need for a centrifugation step.</p><p>One problem with the centrifugation and filtration-based methods outlined above is that cell-derived components are concentrated along with the vector particles. These have the potential to cause immune and inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. For example, concentrated VSV-G-pseudotyped LV vector preparations were shown to be contaminated with tubovesicular structures of cellular origin which carried nucleic acids, including the plasmid DNAs that were used to generate the LV vector stocks. DNA carried by these tubovesicular structures acted as a stimulus for innate antiviral responses, triggering Toll-like receptor 9 and inducing alpha/beta interferon production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, additional steps including chromatography-based methods such as anion exchange chromatography are needed in order to reduce host cell and cell culture-derived contaminants from LV vector preparations. Methods based on anion exchange column chromatography of LV vectors pseudotyped with VSV-G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] or the baculovirus GP64 glycoprotein were previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, the yields and purity of the LV vector stocks obtained in this way were not reported.</p><p>In an attempt to simplify the production and concentration of LV vectors and to make this approach more reproducible and cost-effective for preclinical studies in animals, we have worked out a facile LV vector production system based on HYPERFlasks. We also implemented a straightforward concentration procedure based on Mustang Q anion exchange membrane chromatography. Mustang Q anion exchange-based chromatography protocols for concentrating/purifying LV vectors were previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Such vector preparations displayed reduced toxicity compared to vectors concentrated using ultracentrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], as well as enhanced purity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Simplified production of lentiviral vectors using HYPERFlasks</title><p>With a view toward improving high-titer LV vector production for preclinical studies in animals, we tested the usefulness of HYPERFlask vessels that have a total growth area of 1720 cm<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to ten standard T175 flasks. HYPERFlasks consist of ten interconnected growth surfaces each containing a membrane pretreated to allow improved cell adherence. The membrane is gas permeable, allowing exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide through the base of the membrane, resulting in gas exposure to a large surface area within the flask [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>To test the usefulness of HYPERFlasks for LV vector production involving calcium phosphate-mediated transfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], we compared the titers of LV vector stocks prepared side-by-side using either ten 150-cm<sup>2 </sup>dishes or a single HYPERFlask. The data shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> represent the results of three independent productions each for the 150-cm<sup>2 </sup>dish system and the HYPERFlask system. These data indicate that the titers of unconcentrated LV vectors produced using HYPERFlasks were up to 2.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>TU/ml while the titers of LV vectors produced in 150-cm<sup>2 </sup>dishes were lower, up to 6.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>TU/ml. The total yields were up to 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10 </sup>TU from ten 150-cm<sup>2 </sup>dishes and up to 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>11 </sup>TU for the HYPERFlask vessels. This corresponds to a productivity of up to 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>TU per cm<sup>2 </sup>for the 150-cm<sup>2 </sup>dishes. For the HYPERFlask, the productivity was about 10-fold higher, up to 0.75 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>TU per cm<sup>2</sup>. The higher productivity observed with HYPERFlasks may be related to better gas exchange during LV vector production. Overall, the 293T cells used for production appeared healthier and there was less cell debris from transfections carried out in HYPERFlaks compared to transfections carried out in 150-cm<sup>2 </sup>dishes (data not shown). We expect the HYPERFlask production protocol described here to be compatible with other DNA transfection formats such as polyethylenimine-mediated transfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Lentiviral vector production using 150-cm<sup>2 </sup>dishes or HYPERFlasks</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">Production vessels</td><td align="center">TU/ml</td><td align="center">Total TU</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">150-cm<sup>2 </sup>dishes</td><td align="center">5.6 &#x000b1; 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup></td><td align="center">9.5 &#x000b1; 2.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center">HYPERFlask</td><td align="center">2.0 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup></td><td align="center">1.1 &#x000b1; 0.16 &#x000d7; 10<sup>11</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Ten 150-cm<sup>2 </sup>dishes (total volume: 170 ml) and one HYPERFlask vessel (volume: 550 ml) were used for LV vector production.

Chromatography-based methods appear to be particularly attractive in this regard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. For example, methods to concentrate/purify LV vectors based on anion exchange or affinity chromatography have been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Recently, Segura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] described an approach involving heparin affinity chromatography to concentrate LV vector particles directly from clarified supernatants. During this step, a recovery of 53% of infectious LV particles was achieved while 94% of the impurities were removed. This strategy may ultimately result in vector stocks of improved purity, increased infectivity and reduced toxicity. However, these approaches are cumbersome and difficult to implement in a standard laboratory setting.</p><p>We have recently described a facile membrane-based chromatography approach involving Mustang Q anion exchange chromatography cartridges (Acrodiscs) to purify adenoviral vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Mustang Q membranes resulted in high recoveries of infectious viral particles and allowed the processing of adenoviral vector particles from lysates in a fraction of the time required using the traditional cesium chloride-based ultracentrifugation method. Mustang Q membranes include a matrix that has a high dynamic binding capacity for adenoviral vectors and is capable of withstanding high flow rates. Other benefits of Mustang Q membrane chromatography cartridges include higher peak resolution at faster flow rates as compared to traditional ion exchange resins. Also, they can easily be adapted to bench-scale work and they are syringe-adaptable. Finally, there is no need for an HPLC setup or a column packing step. In work with LV vectors carried out by us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], Mustang Q-based cartridges were used to concentrate/purify LV vectors. While these initial studies were encouraging, the capacity of Mustang Q membranes for crude LV vector supernatants was rather low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], possibly caused by cell-derived proteins, serum proteins, or contaminating nucleic acids that bound to Mustang Q membranes during vector capturing.</p><p>To determine the binding capacity of Mustang Q membranes for LV vectors produced in HYPERFlask vessels compared to 150-cm<sup>2 </sup>dishes, a capture study was conducted. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows a typical elution profile of HYPERFlask-produced LV vectors following capturing onto a 0.18-ml Mustang Q Acrodisc and elution using a gradient ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 M NaCl. TU were determined by FACS analysis of transduced HOS cells. The results presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> show that the capacity of Mustang Q Acrodiscs at 10% breakthrough for LV vector supernatants produced in 150-cm<sup>2 </sup>dishes was up to 3.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9 </sup>TU per ml of membrane while the capacity of Mustang Q membranes at 10% breakthrough for HYPERFlask vessel-derived LV vector samples was up to 9.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>10 </sup>TU per ml of membrane. This is consistent with the observation that LV vector supernatants produced using HYPERFlasks contained fewer cellular proteins and nucleic acids compared to supernatants produced in 150-cm<sup>2 </sup>dishes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>) that may have interfered with the binding of the LV vector particles. To remove excess NaCl, pooled Mustang Q fractions were subjected to a buffer exchange using Sepharose CL-4B.

The yield (total TU) from a single HYPERFlask (cell growth area: 1720 cm<sup>2</sup>) was above 10<sup>11 </sup>TU (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This is about two orders of magnitude higher than the yields reported by Karolewski et al.
