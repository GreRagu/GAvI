ExPEC are causative agents of a range of diseases, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), nosocomial pneumonia, neonatal meningitis, and neonatal sepsis. UTIs comprise a range of disorders, including cystitis (infection of the bladder) and pyelonephritis (infection of the kidney), which are defined by the presence of microorganisms in the otherwise sterile urinary tract. UTIs are one of the most common bacterial infections, with an estimated 33&#x00025; of women in the United States suffering from a UTI requiring antimicrobial therapy by the age of 24 and 40&#x02013;50&#x00025; of women experiencing a UTI at least once during their lifetime <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Foxman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Foxman2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Even though UTIs are associated with minimal morbidity, the annual financial costs associated with their incidence are estimated at a staggering 2 billion dollars for the US alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Foxman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Foxman2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>There are many known microbial causative agents of UTIs, including <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</italic>, and <italic>E. coli</italic>. Of these, uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (UPEC) are of special interest because they cause approximately 40&#x00025; of hospital and 80&#x00025; of community acquired UTIs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Ronald1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The success of UPEC as pathogens can be attributed to their panoply of virulence factors. These include a variety of toxins, such as cytotoxic and necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1), hemolysin (<italic>hlyA</italic>), and secreted autotransporter toxin (Sat), and a diverse range of adhesins, including type 1 and P pili. CNF1 is a dermonecrotic toxin that increases the invasiveness of UPEC by activating Rho GTPases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Landraud1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and also modulates the function(s) of polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes (PMNs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Davis1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. HlyA targets erythrocytes and leukocytes to bring about cell lysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Kaper1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, but exactly how it aids UPEC virulence is unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Davis1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Sat is a cytolytic vacuolating toxin that has been shown to damage the glomerular membrane and proximal tubule cells in the kidney, and to create lesions in intestinal and renal epithelial cell tight junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Guignot1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Guyer1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The adhesins present at the tips of type 1 and P pili, FimH and PapG, respectively, aid UPEC in adhering to the bladder and kidney epithelial cells of the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Mulvey1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Bock1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, FimH behaves as an invasin, causing reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and localized alterations in the host cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Martinez1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, a variety of structurally and functionally different virulence factors work to aid the pathogenesis of UPEC in the host urinary tract.</p><p>Until recently, UPEC were considered to be predominantly extracellular pathogens of the urinary tract. Even though there were reports showing UPEC internalization by mouse bladder superficial epithelial cells, this was considered a result of phagocytosis by the bladder epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-McTaggart1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In 1998, it was shown that UPEC adhere to and invade cells of the bladder epithelium in a FimH-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Mulvey1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Once internalized, the bacteria escape the endosomes by an unknown mechanism and start replicating in the host cytoplasm to form biofilm-like structures termed intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). The growing IBCs push against the epithelial cell membrane giving it a pod-like appearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Anderson1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. A recent study found that by 1 h post infection with 10<sup>7</sup> colony forming units (CFU) of the UPEC strain UTI89, approximately 50&#x00025; of the bacteria in the murine bladder were intracellular, and by 6 h post infection 20 to 210 IBCs per bladder were detected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Justice1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In response to replicating bacterial loads, epithelial cells exfoliate and are purged by urine flow as part of an innate immune response. PMNs are also recruited to sites of UPEC infection. Intracellular niches are considered to provide the UPEC a safe haven away from the host's immune defenses. UPEC escape the exfoliating cells by fluxing out and invading the underlying layers of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Mulvey1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Mulvey2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Type II secretion systems (T2SS) are involved in the secretion of many important effectors in diverse Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Jiang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Hales1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

rid="pone.0004752-Martinez1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). This assay tests the ability of UPEC to adhere to and invade human urothelial cells, form intracellular replicating foci, and efflux out of the infected cells. The assay was carried out using the 5637 human bladder and A498 human kidney cell lines. We observed no defects for the CFT073 or UTI89 secretin knockout mutants in adhering to or invading the human bladder or kidney cells compared to the parental WT strains (data not shown). In addition, no differences were detected in the ability of the knockout mutants to grow intracellularly in the bladder or kidney cells, over a period of 48 hours.</p><p>Bladder epithelial cells are exfoliated and washed off by urine as an innate immune response to infection by UPEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Mulvey2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. To escape the exfoliating cells, UPEC efflux out of the infected cells and spread to other parts of the urinary tract. Interestingly, the UTI89 &#x00394;<italic>hofQ</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>gspD</italic> strains consistently exhibited approximately 2-fold reductions (p&#x0003c;0.01) in their ability to efflux out of human bladder cells as compared to the WT UTI89 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004752-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

The efflux defect was specific to the UTI89 cystitis isolate, as none of the CFT073 secretin knockout mutants exhibited defects in fluxing out of the bladder cells (data not shown). Furthermore, the efflux defect occurred only in bladder cells, as each of the UTI89 and CFT073 secretin knockout mutants fluxed out of kidney cells similar to the parental WT strains (data not shown). Thus, both the putative T2S and T4P systems appear to assist the escape of the UTI89 cystitis isolate, but not the CFT073 pyelonephritis isolate, from bladder epithelial cells. Attempts to rescue the efflux defects of the UTI89 mutants by expressing the deleted secretin in trans from expression plasmids were not successful, and thus we cannot rule out that the observed defects were caused by secondary effects of the deletion mutations. However, the complemented strains exhibited even greater efflux defects compared to the uncomplemented mutants (data not shown), suggesting that our inability to complement the deletions may have been due to constitutive expression of the secretins from an artificial promoter.</p><fig id="pone-0004752-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004752.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Efflux of UTI89 WT and secretin mutant strains from 5637 human bladder epithelial cells.</title><p>A modified gentamicin protection assay (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) was used to calculate efflux of WT UTI89 or the indicated deletion mutant from monolayers of 5637 human bladder epithelial cells.

Although functions for these secretion pathways have been established for intestinal pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>, their roles in the virulence of ExPEC have not been investigated. In this report, we begin to address this question by constructing deletion mutations to disable putative T2SS and T4P gene clusters present in the genomes of the model UPEC strains UTI89 and CFT073. We compared these mutants to their WT counterparts using both in vitro and in vivo assays. Our results show that putative T4P and/or T2S systems are important to the pathogenesis of UPEC in the urinary tract, particularly in the ability to successfully colonize and persist within the kidneys.</p><p>Both the cystitis isolate UTI89 and the pyelonephritis isolate CFT073 possess putative T2SS and T4P gene clusters sharing very close homology (generally 91&#x02013;99&#x00025; amino acid identity) with genes present in <italic>E. coli</italic> K12. In K12 strains, the T2SS does not appear to be expressed under standard growth conditions, but this system was shown to be de-repressed in mutants lacking the nucleotide structuring protein H-NS and to function in the secretion of chitinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Francetic1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, the <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 T4P genes are transcribed at low levels and T4P are not detected under standard laboratory conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Sauvonnet1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, we were unable to detect expression of T4P by the UPEC strains grown under a variety of conditions using whole-bacteria, negative-stain electron microscopy (R.K. and D.G.T., unpublished data). We note that a recent study showed that the major pilin subunit PpdD (HcpA) was assembled into T4P in EHEC when the bacteria were cultured on minimal casein medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-XicohtencatlCortes1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, expression of the <italic>ppdDhofBC</italic> (<italic>hcpABC)</italic> gene cluster from EHEC in an <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 strain resulted in surface expression of the PpdD pilin, suggesting that the T4P assembly machinery in K12 strains is functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-XicohtencatlCortes2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. We were also unable to detect differences in proteins secreted into culture supernatant fractions between the secretin knockout mutants and the parental UPEC strains (R.K. and D.G.T., unpublished data), and thus could not confirm functionality of the T2SS gene clusters. However, the <italic>yheF</italic> (<italic>gspD</italic>) secretin was recently found to be required for surface expression of the DraD invasin in both uropathogenic and laboratory <italic>E. coli</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-ZalewskaPiatek1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that the T2SS gene cluster is functional. Finally, the virulence defects we observed for the UTI89 &#x00394;<italic>hofQ</italic> and CFT073 &#x00394;<italic>yheF</italic> &#x00394;<italic>hofQ</italic> mutants support the idea that the K12-homologous T2SS and T4P gene clusters are functional and expressed under conditions encountered within the host.</p><p>In addition to the K12-homologous systems, the UTI89 cystitis isolate contains a second putative T2SS cluster homologous to genes present in ETEC. In ETEC this T2SS enables the secretion of heat labile enterotoxin, which is critical for pathogenesis in the intestinal tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Tauschek1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This raises the possibility that the ETEC-T2SS might allow secretion of a toxin or other virulence factor by UTI89. Furthermore, since the ETEC-T2SS is absent from the genome of the CFT073 pyelonephritis isolate, the ETEC-T2SS might be specifically associated with the ability of UTI89 to cause cystitis. To check for a correlation between the cystitic nature of a UPEC strain and the presence of the ETEC-T2SS, we analyzed a panel of pathogenic and non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates by PCR using ETEC-T2SS specific primer pairs. Results from this analysis indicated that the ETEC-T2SS gene cluster is widespread among <italic>E. coli</italic> clinical isolates, without any apparent correlation with the origin of the isolate (R.K. and D.G.T., unpublished data). Examination of the available genome sequences of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains by BLAST analysis also showed the ETEC-T2SS to be prevalent. Thus, CFT073 appears to be an outlier among <italic>E. coli</italic> strains in lacking the ETEC-T2SS.</p><p>In the CBA/J mouse model of ascending UTI, we found that the &#x00394;<italic>hofQ</italic> mutant of UTI89 was consistently defective in colonization of kidneys on day 7 post-infection as compared to WT UTI89. Complementation of UTI89 &#x00394;<italic>hofQ</italic> with plasmid-borne <italic>hofQ</italic> restored kidney colonization, confirming that the defect of the knockout mutant was specifically due to loss of the <italic>hofQ</italic> secretin. Similar in vivo defects were not observed for the UTI89 &#x00394;<italic>yheF</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>gspD</italic> mutants. If <italic>hofQ</italic> is indeed involved the expression of T4P, these observations reveal a specific role for T4P in the ability of UTI89 to persistently colonize the kidney. In the pyelonephritogenic isolate CFT073, mutants containing single deletions of &#x00394;<italic>hofQ</italic> or &#x00394;<italic>yheF</italic> were able to infect and colonize bladder and kidney tissues similar to the WT strain. However, a CFT073 double knockout mutant lacking both <italic>yheF</italic> and <italic>hofQ</italic> showed significantly reduced colonization of the kidney on day 7 post-infection. The CFT073 double mutant also exhibited reduced bacterial titers in the bladder on day 7 post-infection, although this reduction was not statistically significant. These results suggest that both the putative T2S and T4P systems contribute to the ability of CFT073 to persistently colonize the urinary tract. The two secretins, <italic>yheF</italic> and <italic>hofQ</italic>, from CFT073 may perform overlapping or redundant functions, explaining why a defect was only detected in the double knockout strain. Complementation of the CFT073 double mutant with <italic>hofQ</italic> in trans significantly restored kidney colonization, but the increased colonization upon expression of <italic>yheF</italic> in trans did not reach statistical significance. This could indicate a more important role for <italic>hofQ</italic> in colonization of the kidney, in agreement with the UTI89 results. Alternatively, lack of full complementation by <italic>yheF</italic> could be attributed to expression of <italic>yheF</italic> from an artificial promoter on the plasmid. Further investigation is required to determine the specific contributions of <italic>hofQ</italic> and <italic>yheF</italic> to the pathogenesis of CFT073.</p><p>We did not observe defects for the UTI89 or CFT073 secretin knockout mutants in adhesion, invasion, or replication in human urothelial cells. UPEC adhere to bladder and kidney cells with the help of type 1 and P pili, and in case of the bladder epithelium their entry into the superficial umbrella cells is mediated by the type 1 pilus tip adhesin, FimH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Martinez1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence it was expected that none of the UTI89 or CFT073 knockout mutants, generated by specifically targeting the secretins from the putative T2SS and T4P gene clusters, would be defective in adhesion or invasion. In addition, we did not detect changes in cytotoxicity of the UPEC mutants toward host cells or ability to suppress IL-6 expression by the bladder epithelial cells. Thus, these functions in UPEC presumably are not mediated by the putative T2S and T4P pathways. Using a modified gentamicin protection assay that mimics several aspects of UPEC pathogenesis, we did observe that knockout mutants in UTI89 lacking <italic>hofQ</italic> and <italic>gspD</italic> were defective in fluxing out of the bladder epithelial cell line. This efflux defect could underlie the in vivo defect observed for the UTI89 &#x00394;<italic>hofQ</italic> mutant, but we do no believe this to be the case, as the UTI89 &#x00394;<italic>gspD</italic> mutant had no in vivo phenotype despite being equally defective for efflux in vitro. Furthermore, no efflux defect was found for any of the CFT073 secretin mutants. Efflux defects for the UTI89 &#x00394;<italic>hofQ</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>gspD</italic> mutants were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy using green fluorescent protein-expressing strains, but these experiments indicated a delay in efflux rather than an absolute defect (R.K. and D.G.T. unpublished results). This, together with the relatively small (&#x0223c;2-fold) scale of the defect, could explain the lack of correlation between the cell culture and in vivo results.</p><p>Based on our findings, and assuming that the putative T2SS and T4P gene clusters function as expected based on their homology to established systems, we propose that T4P aid in the colonization and persistence of UPEC in the urinary tract, particularly the upper urinary tract. Although, flagella have been implicated in the ascent of UPEC along the ureters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Lane1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, the role for other bacterial factors that might aid in this process is still undefined. In a number of Gram-negative pathogens, association with the host epithelium followed by motility and dispersal over the epithelial surface are mediated by T4P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Merz1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. T4P in UPEC might play a similar role, although colonization of the urinary tract at early time points post-infection were similar in both the mutant and WT strains. Alternatively, T4P may specifically aid in the colonization of kidney tissues by UPEC, possibly by mediating bacterial-bacterial and bacterial-host interactions and/or the formation of biofilms. Another possibility is that in the absence of functional T4P and/or the T2SS, the mutant bacteria were defective due to the lack of an unknown secreted effector, leading to clearance of the bacteria by day 7 post-infection. ExPEC employ a broad array of virulence factors, including type 1 and P pili, and secreted toxins such as CNF1, hemolysin and Sat. Our results suggest this impressive list of weaponry may need to be expanded to include T4P and possibly also the T2SS, opening new avenues to understanding the molecular mechanisms of <italic>E. coli</italic> pathogenesis in the upper urinary tract.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial Strains and Cell Lines</title><p>UPEC strain CFT073 was isolated from the blood of a woman suffering from pyelonephritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Mobley1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> and UPEC strain UTI89 was isolated from a cystitis patient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004752-Mulvey3">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

To generate double knockout mutants, one antibiotic resistance gene (for example, Kan) was first used to replace one of the target genes by homologous recombination. A different antibiotic resistance gene (for example, Cml) was then used to replace the second target gene. The resultant recombinant bacteria were screened for disruption of the two different target loci by growing on LB plates supplemented with kanamycin and chloramphenicol.
