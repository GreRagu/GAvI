SD rats had around 60% more cells labeled with Ki67 (an index of mitosis) than LH rats under basal conditions. Bilateral adrenalectomy (ADX) increased levels in both strains, but by unequal amounts, such that post-ADX numbers of Ki67-labeled cells were similar in both strains. Daily injections of 5 mg/kg corticosterone for 7 days reduced levels to similar values in ADX rats of both strains. The activity of progenitor cells in either strain did not respond to daily i.p. injections of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) for 14 days, but an equivalent dose administered by osmotic minipump stimulated proliferation in both by a similar proportional amount, such that strain differences persisted. S.c. implantation of a corticosterone pellet (75 mg), which flattens the diurnal rhythm in corticosterone, prevented fluoxetine delivered by minipump from activating progenitor cell mitosis in SD rats, as it had in the LH strain in a previous study. These results show that much, if not all, of the marked strain differences between SD and LH rats in progenitor cell activity, and hence rates of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus may be ascribed to corresponding differences in adrenal cortical activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>strain differences</kwd><kwd>corticoids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>AADC, aromatic amino acid decarboxylase</kwd><kwd>ADX, adrenalectomized/adrenalectomy</kwd><kwd>ANOVA, analysis of variance</kwd><kwd>CT, circadian time</kwd><kwd>HPA, hypothamalo-pituitary&#x02013;adrenal</kwd><kwd>IHC, immunohistochemistry</kwd><kwd>KPBS, potassium phosphate buffer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Neurogenesis, or the generation of new neurons, in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is now known to persist during adulthood in several mammalian species (<xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib10 bib11 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Eriksson et al., 1998; Gage, 2000; Gould et al., 1999, 2000; Yamashima et al., 2007</xref>). Far from being constant, the rate of neurogenesis is regulated by many factors (<xref rid="bib1 bib5 bib6 bib19 bib21 bib22 bib25 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Bruel-Jungerman et al., 2007; Duman, 2005; Engesser-Cesar et al., 2007; Kuhn et al., 1997; Levenson and Rich, 2007; Luo et al., 2007; McEwen, 2002; Wong and Herbert, 2005</xref>), among which glucocorticoids are prominent (<xref rid="bib2 bib14 bib15 bib33 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Cameron and Gould, 1994; Huang and Herbert, 2006; Joels and Vreugdenhil, 1998; Wong and Herbert, 2005, 2006</xref>). Neurogenesis is exquisitely sensitive to these steroids, though whether this is because of direct action on the progenitor cells themselves, or an indirect one on other cells forming the cellular niche within which neurogenesis occurs is still uncertain. Corticosterone treatment of rats or mice sharply reduces the proliferative rate of progenitor cells (<xref rid="bib2 bib9 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Cameron and Gould, 1994; Gould et al., 1992; Wong and Herbert, 2004</xref>), as well as their ability to form mature neurons (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Wong and Herbert, 2006</xref>). Adrenalectomy (ADX) has the reverse effects, showing that endogenous corticoids also regulate neurogenesis (<xref rid="bib9 bib2" ref-type="bibr">Gould et al., 1992; Cameron and Gould, 1994</xref>). The extreme sensitivity to corticoids is further reflected by the diurnal rhythm in corticosterone being able to drive a corresponding rhythm in the progenitor cells (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Pinnock et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its proximate control of neurogenesis, the diurnal rhythm of corticosterone in the rat has another function: it gates the access of other agents, such as drugs that alter either 5-HT (e.g. fluoxetine) or nitric oxide (NO) (e.g. NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester) to the control system regulating the activity of the progenitor cells (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Herbert, 2006</xref>). In the presence of an intact rhythm, both drugs stimulate proliferation, but this is prevented if this rhythm is absent or flattened in Lister-Hooded (LH) rats. There is, therefore, an interaction between 5-HT and glucocorticoids in the dentate gyrus. Since both corticoids and 5-HT are highly responsive to external events&#x02014;such as a stressful stimulus&#x02014;these systems are a powerful way by which the external environment influences the rates of new neuron production in the adult hippocampus.</p><p>There are reports, in mice, of strain (i.e. genetic) differences in neurogenesis (<xref rid="bib17 bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kempermann et al., 1997, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib29 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Pozniak and Pleasure, 2006; Schauwecker, 2006</xref>). So far, there has been no exploration of similar differences in rats or, more importantly, whether these are dependent on equivalent differences in the activity of the hypothamalo-pituitary&#x02013;adrenal (HPA) axis in either species. Neither is there information on whether sensitivity to 5-HT-acting drugs&#x02014;such as fluoxetine&#x02014;are strain-dependent or also related to strain-related differences in HPA activity. Since the actions of fluoxetine may have clinical as well as experimental interest, these questions need to be addressed.</p><p>In this paper we show that there are marked differences in basal rates of progenitor cell proliferation in two strains of male rats (Sprague&#x02013;Dawley (SD) and LH); that this is associated with corresponding differences in basal levels of plasma corticosterone; that the progenitor cells in both strains respond to fluoxetine in an equivalent manner relative to their basal rates of proliferation but that this depends on the route of administration; that the response of SD rats to fluoxetine is also dependent on an intact diurnal corticoid rhythm; and, finally, that these strain differences are abolished by ADX and subsequent treatment with a standard replacement dose of corticosterone, pointing to a central role for the HPA axis in determining strain differences in neurogenesis.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were carried out under Home Office (UK) license.

In view of the differences in corticosterone levels between the two strains, this experiment tested whether this also applies to SD rats. Corticosterone pellets implanted s.c. prevented the effect of fluoxetine given by osmotic minipump for 14 days on proliferation of progenitor cells in the SD strain.

(2006)</xref>) of the progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus in two strains of rat, SD and LH, both of which have been used by different groups to study neurogenesis. There could be many mechanisms to account for these differences, including genetic factors that alter the niche environment in which these cells reside in the dentate gyrus. However, our results show clearly that strain differences in corticoids may account for much of this variation. SD rats had a much higher proliferation rate than LH, but also a significantly lower level of plasma corticosterone. Since we measured this at only one time point, we cannot provide further information on strain differences in the shape of the diurnal rhythm in this steroid. The association between corticosterone and mitosis rates in the dentate gyrus led us to suspect a functional relationship (<xref rid="bib2 bib14 bib15 bib33 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Cameron and Gould, 1994; Huang and Herbert, 2006; Joels and Vreugdenhil, 1998; Wong and Herbert, 2005, 2006</xref>), and this proved to be the case. ADX, a procedure which removes endogenous corticoids, is well-known to increase basal rates of progenitor cell proliferation (<xref rid="bib9 bib2" ref-type="bibr">Gould et al., 1992; Cameron and Gould, 1994</xref>). This occurred in both SD and LH: but the important point was that proliferation increased to the same absolute level in both strains, suggesting that the &#x02018;ceiling&#x02019; was the same in both, and that control (intact) levels might be determined by strain differences in corticosterone. This was proved by giving both strains the same daily does of replacement corticosterone, which resulted in equal levels of proliferation. There is thus no strain difference in the sensitivity of the progenitor process to corticosterone, and it seems clear that it is the difference in basal corticosterone that determines those in neurogenesis between SD and LH male rats. The mechanisms for strain differences in the HPA axis remain to be explored, but were not an objective of the experiments reported here. Strain differences in neurogenesis may not be wholly dependent on those in the HPA axis. For example, 5-HT-related properties might play a part but this remains a topic for further study. It has been shown that aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), the enzyme responsible for converting the intermediate product of 5-HT (5-OH tryptophan) into its final form (5-HT) is higher in SD than LH in both brain stem and adrenal gland (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 1990</xref>), although AADC is not thought to be the key enzyme in the production of 5-HT.</p><p>Both strains also responded similarly to fluoxetine. We find that proliferation rates do not respond to daily i.p. injections of 10/mg/kg fluoxetine, and this confirms several other previous unpublished observations by our group. This is in contrast to those groups who report that i.p. injections are effective, though sometimes given twice daily or for a period more than 14 days (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Manev et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Malberg et al., 2000</xref>). The reasons for these differences remain obscure. However, we consistently find that fluoxetine given by osmotic minipumps at this dose can stimulate proliferation rates. This seemed to be related to basal levels, since although the percentage increase was the same in both strains, the absolute levels of Ki67-labeled progenitor cells were higher in the SD strain following fluoxetine. It seems highly likely that these differences were also attributable to strain differences in plasma corticosterone; it is important to note that fluoxetine itself had no effect on corticosterone levels. The striking finding that flattening the diurnal rhythm in corticosterone prevents fluoxetine from increasing progenitor cell mitosis was reported in LH rats (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Herbert, 2006</xref>), and here we confirm this finding and show that it applies also to SD rats, despite their lower levels of plasma corticosterone. It appears that an intact diurnal rhythm in corticosterone is a requirement for the effects of this SSRI on neurogenesis in both strains, suggesting a general phenomenon. There is still little definite information on the reasons why this rhythm is required for other controlling agents to access the process regulating progenitor cell proliferation, but studies on this are in progress.</p><p>The results reported here strengthen the role of glucocorticoids in the control of neurogenesis. They suggest that much of the lability and genetic differences associated with the rate and maturation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of adult rats can be ascribed to regulation by these steroids. Future studies directed toward better understanding of the functional implications of adult neurogenesis, as well as its potential clinical significance in, for example, the therapeutic response to anti-depressants such as fluoxetine (<xref rid="bib4 bib12 bib13 bib26 bib30" ref-type="bibr">Drew and Hen, 2007; Herbert, 2008; Holick et al., 2007; Meshi et al., 2006; Santarelli et al.,
