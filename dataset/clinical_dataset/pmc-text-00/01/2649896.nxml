Thus, scientific research is targeting towards the identification of immunohistochemical and molecular markers that could be useful regarding diagnosis, appropriate therapy and prediction of prognosis. In the present study we assessed and correlated the expression of caspase-8, phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38) and bcl-2 protein with histopathological features and clinical outcome of 27 patients with ccRCCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>Immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections was performed. The associations among various features were assessed utilizing statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that increased expression of cytoplasmic caspase-8 and bcl-2 protein was strongly associated with low Fuhrman's grade of carcinomas (p = 0.019 and p = 0.041, respectively). On the other hand, increased p-p38 expression was significantly related to high Fuhrman's grade (p = 0.006). Moreover, high bcl-2 expression was correlated with low pathological stage of ccRCCs (p = 0.026). Increased expression of cytoplasmic caspase-8 as well as low-grade tumors (grade 1 and 2) implied a greater probability of patients' survival, in univariate statistical analysis (p = 0.037 and p = 0.019, respectively). Neither p-p38 nor bcl-2 expression was significantly linked to patients' survival. There were not emerged statistically significant associations among caspase-8, p-p38 kinase and bcl-2 protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>For the first time the prognostic impact of caspase-8 and p-p38 was studied in a series of ccRCCs, using immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The suggestive relationship of caspase-8 with patients' clinical outcome, as well as the role of p-p38 within different grade categories, mandates further studies in larger cohorts of RCCs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Conventional (clear) RCCs (ccRCCs) are characterized by their relatively poor prognosis due to late presentation and resistance to various therapeutical manipulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Thus, the identification of new immunohistochemical and molecular markers that could provide better prognostic information for each patient is needed. In this context, the role of factors, such as bcl-2 protein, caspases and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), influencing cell survival-proliferation and apoptosis, has not been fully understood yet, within ccRCCs.</p><p>Bcl-2 is an intracellular membrane protein capable of blocking the programmed cell death through regulation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although bcl-2 is frequently upregulated in RCCs, studies of its exact relationship with patients' clinicopathological features have given controversial results thus far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Caspases are proteases characterized by their essential action in the apoptotic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Caspase-8, particularly, plays a decisive role as an initiator caspase in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway since its activation leads to caspase-3 activation and accordingly to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, bibliographical data regarding caspase-8 immunohistochemical expression in RCCs are limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>p38, a member of the MAPKs group, participates in a signaling cascade regulating cellular responses to cytokines and stress and seems to play a role in cell proliferation and apoptosis within RCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Few former studies assessed the immunohistochemical expression of p38 in RCCs but the impact of activated (phosphorylated) p38 (p-p38) on patients' survival has not been described yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Experimental data suggest that p38 pathway may function both upstream and downstream of caspases (including caspase-8) in the apoptotic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Moreover, p38 kinase appears to play a crucial role regarding bcl-2 phosphorylation and its subsequent inactivation, leading to an increased apoptotic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Nevertheless, this dual, yet controversial, function of p38 kinase which links three different apoptotic pathways has never been studied within RCCs.</p><p>The purpose of our study was to assess and compare the immunohistochemical expression of p-p38, bcl-2 and caspase-8 in ccRCCs, identifying any associations with Fuhrman's grade, pathological stage and patients' clinical outcome. To our knowledge this is the first study attempting to explore the specific prognostic influence of p-p38 and caspase-8 immunohistochemical expression within ccRCCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>27 patients with ccRCCs [15 men and 12 women, mean age at operation: 58.15 years (range: 42&#x02013;77)] underwent radical nephrectomy between 1999 and 2003 at our Hospital. Follow-up information was available in all cases, informed consent was obtained from all patients and the study was approved by the scientific committee of the Hospital. The mean time of follow-up was 70.63 months (range: 11&#x02013;105), during which 4 patients died of the disease [mean survival: 40.75 months (range: 11&#x02013;54)] whereas 23 were alive [mean follow-up: 75.83 months (range: 44&#x02013;105)].</p><p>All specimens were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. For each patient, one representative block containing more than 80% of neoplastic tissue was histopathologically evaluated. All tumors were graded according to Fuhrman's grading system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] as: grade 1 (n = 7), grade 2 (n = 13), grade 3 (n = 4) and grade 4 (n = 3). The pathological stage (pT-stage) was determined using the TNM classification of malignant tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] as: pT1a (n = 5), pT1b (n = 6), pT2 (n = 8), pT3a (n = 5) and pT3b (n = 3).</p><p>p-p38, bcl-2 and caspase-8 immunostaing was performed in representative sections, cut at 3 &#x003bc;m, using Bond-maX system (Vision BioSystems Ltd, Australia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following antibodies were used: anti-phopsho-p38 MAPK (clone 12F8, rabbit mAb, Cell Signaling Technology Inc. USA, diluted: 1/100), anti-bcl-2 protein (clone 124, mouse mAb, Dako Cytomation, Denmark, diluted: 1/50) and anti-caspase-8 (clone 11B6, mouse mAb, Novocastra, UK, diluted: 1/30).</p><p>Under light microscope, p-p38 and bcl-2 immunostaining was estimated as the percentage of neoplastic cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic reactivity, respectively, out of the total number of neoplastic cells counted. The same method was also applied for the assessment of cytoplasmic caspase-8 immunostaining. However, because of a marked intratumoral heterogeneity of its expression, a score was given to sections based on the estimated percentage of immunopositive cells (1 = &#x02264;25%, 2 = 26&#x02013;50%, 3 = 51&#x02013;75%, 4 = &#x0003e;75%) and on the intensity of the immunostaining (1 = no staining or weak, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong, 4 = very strong). A final combined score of immunostaining was then calculated by adding both scores (weak = score 2&#x02013;3, moderate = score 4&#x02013;6, strong = score 7&#x02013;8). The presence or absence of nuclear caspase-8 staining was also assessed separately and scored as positive or negative (&#x0003e;10% or &#x02264; 10% positive cells out of the total number of neoplastic cells counted, respectively).</p><p>For statistical calculations, p-p38 expression and bcl-2 cytoplasmic expression as well as patients' age were treated as continuous variables. Cytoplasmic and nuclear caspase-8 expression, tumor grade, pT-stage and patients' sex were analyzed as categorical variables. Associations among continuous variables were tested using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient whereas correlations among categorical variables using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. The relationship between a continuous and a categorical variable was examined using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test or Mann-Whitney U-test, as appropriate.</p><p>Univariate survival analysis was performed using death due to disease as the endpoint. The effect of the various features on clinical outcome was assessed by plotting survival curves according to Kaplan-Meier method and comparing groups with the Log-rank test. Continuous variables were categorized on the basis of the median value rounded at its nearest 10%. Caspase-8 cytoplasmic expression was treated as a categorical variable (weak versus moderate/strong) as well as patients' gender. Grade and pT-stage were categorized in two groups (grade 1&#x02013;2 versus grade 3&#x02013;4 and pT1a-pT1b-pT2 versus pT3a-pT3b, respectively) due to the different biological behavior of these groups within ccRCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. All statistical calculations were completed using the statistical package SPSS, version 13.0, for Windows Software (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Differences were considered statistically significant when p-value (two-sided) was &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Caspase-8, p-p38 and bcl-2 expression</title><p>Caspase-8 cytoplasmic expression was detected in 27/27 cases [percentage of positive neoplastic cells: 15%&#x02013;90% (mean value: 48.85%)] [Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>]. Thus, the cytoplasmic score was as follows: score 1 (n = 7 cases), score 2 (n = 8), score 3 (n = 8), score 4 (n = 4). The intensity of cytoplasmic staining was as follows: score 1 (n = 2), score 2 (n = 8), score 3 (n = 9), score 4 (n = 8). Therefore, the final caspase-8 combined cytoplasmic score was: score 1 (weak immunostaining: n = 5), score 2 (moderate immunostaining: n = 13), score 3 (strong immunostaining: n = 9).

This function, which seems to be distinct from its well-known antiapoptotic action, has been reported in various malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that high expression of bcl-2 prevents cell proliferation, suppresses tumor growth and thereby is associated with a lower grade and pT-stage in RCCs, as previously stated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Provided that a possible but not yet adequately studied mechanism, linking the p38 pathway with caspases activity has been previously implied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we attempted to correlate the expression of caspase-8 and p-p38 in our series of RCCs. In this framework, researchers have suggested that caspase-8 is essential for the activation of the p38 pathway through death receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], while others pointed out that an enhanced activation of p38 kinase pathway may result in caspase-8 activation and enhancement of apoptosis, based on experiments in a human astrocytoma cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>However, no statistically significant associations between cytoplasmic or nuclear caspase-8 and p-p38 were revealed in our work, but only a suggestive negative and positive relationship, respectively. These findings backup our aforesaid hypothesis regarding the apoptotic action of cytoplasmic caspase-8 and proliferative or anti-apoptotic role of p-p38 within our ccRCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Moreover, we cannot exclude a potential inhibitory effect of p38 signaling upon caspase activity, as it has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The reason however, for the increased, though statistically insignificant, expression of nuclear caspase-8 in parallel with high p-p38 immunoreactivity, is still to be determined.</p><p>As regards p-p38 and bcl-2 association, no strong linkage was identified in our study. However, p-p38 tended to be inversely related to bcl-2 expression. In this context, scientists have stressed that p38 can induce apoptosis via phosphorylation of bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Concerning RCCs, there are no related studies. According to our work, the negative, though loose, correlation found between p-p38 and bcl-2, constitutes an early indication of a probable antagonistic interaction of these two factors within ccRCCs. The major question to be identified is whether this interaction concerns the proliferative, the apoptotic or both potential functions of these factors.</p><p>No statistically important correlation between bcl-2 and caspase-8 was found. This was expected, since these substances act through different apoptotic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We also demonstrated that low-grade tumors (grade 1 and 2) depicted greater probability of survival in comparison to high-grade (grade 3 and 4), in accordance with previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The absence of statistical significance regarding the association of pT-stage with prognosis could be attributed to the small cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Conclusively, caspase-8 pro-apoptotic function appears to prevail in low-grade ccRCCs and seems to be associated with a better clinical outcome. However, the specific role of cytoplasmic and nuclear caspase-8 needs to be identified. Moreover, p-p38 seems to exert a proliferative rather than an apoptotic role within ccRCCs and is associated with an aggressive phenotype. Finally, the common antiapoptotic role of bcl-2 protein is extremely complicated within ccRCCs and appears to be influenced by other synergic and/or antagonistic pathways. In this regard, p38 MAPK signaling may be of fundamental importance. p38, caspase-8 and bcl-2, though seemingly distinct components of three discrete signaling pathways implicated in cell growth and apoptosis, appear to be characterized, to some extent, by an interrelationship. p38 seems to bridge the above pathways and, in specific tissue substrates, regulates the balance between apoptotic cell death and proliferation. Prospective, larger, experiments are of utmost importance towards the elucidation of the exact clinical role and associations among caspase-8, p-p38 and bcl-2 within the various subtypes as well as the different grade and stage categories of RCCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VS Conception and design of study, writing of manuscript, histological diagnosis.
