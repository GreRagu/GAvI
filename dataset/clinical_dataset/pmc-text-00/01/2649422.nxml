However, since the anticoagulant activity of heparin is dominating, its therapeutic use for other medical indications is limited due to an associated risk of bleeding. Further disadvantages of heparin are its animal origin, the shortage of resources, and its complex and variable composition. However, SP without these limitations may represent a substance class with good prospects for applications other than anticoagulation. In this study, the in vitro pharmacological profiles of two nonanimal-derived SP were investigated in comparison with unfractionated heparin. One is the natural SP fraction from the red algae <italic>Delesseria sanguinea</italic> (D.s.-SP). The other one is the chemically defined PS3, a semisynthetic &#x003b2;-1,3-glucan sulfate with proven in vivo anti-inflammatory and antimetastatic activities. All three polysaccharides were examined in vitro for their inhibitory effects on the coagulation and complement system, polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase, hyaluronidase, matrix metalloproteinase-1, heparanase, and <sc>p</sc>-selectin-mediated cell adhesion. Compared with heparin, the nonanimal-derived polysaccharides have a four times weaker anticoagulant activity, but mostly exhibit stronger (1.4&#x02013;224 times) effects on test systems investigating targets of inflammation or metastasis. According to their different structures, PS3 and D.s.-SP differ in their pharmacological profile with PS3 being the strongest inhibitor of heparanase and cell adhesion and D.s.-SP being the strongest inhibitor of hyaluronidase and complement activation. Considering both pharmacological profile and pharmaceutical quality parameters, PS3 represents a candidate for further development as an anti-inflammatory or antimetastatic drug whereas D.s.-SP might have perspectives for cosmetic applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Delesseria sanguinea</italic></kwd><kwd>glucan sulfate</kwd><kwd>heparin</kwd><kwd>pharmacology</kwd><kwd>PS3</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heparins still represent the drug of choice for prophylaxis and therapy of thromboembolic diseases. Their anticoagulant activity is mainly based on the antithrombin-mediated inhibition of FXa and thrombin. In addition, other antithrombin-independent mechanisms like catalysis of heparin cofactor II-mediated thrombin inhibition or release of the tissue factor pathway inhibitor contribute to their anticoagulant and antithrombotic activities (Alban <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">2008b</xref>). Besides the inhibition of coagulation, heparins exhibit many other biological activities which are involved in its overall therapeutic efficacy. For example, their well-known interferences with the complement system contribute to the improved biocompatibility of heparin-coated medical devices (Hsu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">2001</xref>). Further, the survival benefit of tumor patients treated with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) observed in clinical studies currently attracts attention (Akl et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">2007</xref>; Lazo-Langner et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">2007</xref>). The reduced mortality correlates with experimental animal data on antimetastatic, antiangiogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects of heparins (Smorenburg and van Noorden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">2001</xref>; Lever and Page <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">2002</xref>; Ludwig et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">2006</xref>; Norrby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">2006</xref>). These are rather the result of a concert of actions targeting the (patho)physiological triad of hemostasis, inflammation, and metastasis than to be due to a single mechanism (Alban <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">2008a</xref>). One of the mechanisms currently discussed to be important (Buller et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">2007</xref>) is the inhibition of cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium, which is initiated by selectins, and finally leads to the extravasation of inflammatory and metastasizing tumor cells (Borsig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">2004</xref>). Another one is the inhibition of extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes enabling these cells to migrate through tissues, to invade into vessels, and to extravasate, and also supporting angiogenesis and tumor growth (McCachren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">1991</xref>; Nelson et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">2000</xref>; Parish et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">2001</xref>; Girard et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">2002</xref>; Posey et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">2003</xref>; Taggart et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">2005</xref>; Sato et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">2006</xref>; Vlodavsky et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">2006</xref>).</p><p>However, the strong anticoagulant potency limits the applicability for other therapeutic indications. A further disadvantage of heparins is their animal origin for several reasons. First, drug substances of animal origin should be avoided according to the internationally implemented &#x0201c;precautionary principle&#x0201d; (Alban <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">2005b</xref>). Second, heparin preparations vary considerably depending on the source of raw material and extraction process. Third, they have to be applied in units because of batch-to-batch variability of the highly complex glycosaminoglycan mixtures (Alban <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2005a</xref>). Finally, the increasing demand for heparins is in conflict with the limited resources. The relevance of the latter has recently become manifested by the &#x0201c;heparin scandal&#x0201d; caused by counterfeit heparin (Food and Drug Administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">2008</xref>).</p><p>Besides the vertebrate glycosaminoglycans (GAG), marine organisms are rich sources for SP, such as carrageenans from red algae or fucoidans from brown algae. A representative of this class is the SP fraction isolated from the red algae <italic>Delesseria sanguinea</italic> (Hudson) Lamouroux (D.s.). D.s. turned out to be the dominating algae of an artificial reef installed in the Baltic Sea close to Nienhagen, Germany, several years ago. By an optimized and standardized procedure, these D.s.-SP, consisting of xylose-branched galactan sulfates, can be obtained in a reproducible quality (Gr&#x000fc;newald et&#x000a0;al., in preparation).</p><p>Such natural SP might be suitable as ingredients of cosmetics or food supplements but not for the development of medical products because they would hardly meet the current high requirements on pharmaceutical quality due to their complex structure composition and biovariability. In contrast, chemically defined synthetic or semisynthetic glycan sulfates may be rather promising for the development of new drug substances. A prominent example is fondaparinux, an approved antithrombotic drug. Another one is the &#x003b2;-1,3-glucan sulfate PS3 which showed to have both anti-inflammatory (Yvin et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">2002</xref>; Alban et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">2008</xref>) and antimetastatic effects on animal models (Alban et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">2005</xref>) without the disadvantages of heparins.</p><p>In the present study, we evaluated the pharmacological profiles of D.s.-SP and PS3 in comparison with unfractionated heparin (UFH). Besides investigations of anticoagulant activity and cytotoxicity, inhibition of complement activation, inhibitory effects on extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading enzymes (polymorphonuclear neutrophil elastase (PMNE), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), hyaluronidase, and heparanase) as well as inhibition of tumor cell adhesion to <sc>p</sc>-selectin are presented.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><p>The pharmacological profile of three SP &#x02013; UFH, PS3, and D.s.-SP &#x02013; was determined. These three selected SP differ in their origin as well as in their structural characteristics; UFH is a glucosaminoglycan derived from porcine mucosa and D.s.-SP is the non-gelling SP fraction isolated from the red algae <italic>D. sanguinea</italic> consisting of sulfated xylogalactans. In contrast to these two natural SP, PS3 is a well-defined &#x003b2;-1,3-glucan sulfate, which is produced by semisynthetic modification of Phycarine&#x02122; from <italic>Laminaria digitata</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">I</xref>). To estimate the anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and antimetastatic potential of the test compounds, corresponding in vitro test systems were established. As far as synthetic or structurally defined inhibitors of the examined targets are known, these were included in the tests: GW311616A as PMNE inhibitor, FN-439 as MMP-1 inhibitor, and escin as hyaluronidase inhibitor.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;I</label><caption><p>Sources and structural characterization of UFH, PS3, and D.s.-SP</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">UFH</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PS3</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">D.s.-SP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Source</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Porcine intestinal mucosa</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Semisynthetically modified Phycarine<sup>TM</sup> &#x02003;from <italic>Laminaria digitata</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Delesseria sanguinea</italic></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Molecular mass (M<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5000&#x02013;30,000<sup>a</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9000&#x02013;11,000<sup>a</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hydrodynamic volume (SEC)<sup>b</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10,000&#x02013;60,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16,000&#x02013;20,000</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">25,000&#x02013;280,000</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Degree of sulfation<sup>c</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.2<sup>d</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Basic structure</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Linear glucosaminoglycan</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Linear &#x003b2;-1,3-glucan</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Branched xylogalactan</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="T1TFN1"><p><sup>a</sup>M<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> values of UFH are obtained from literature, those of PS3 were determined by ESI-MS.</p></fn><fn id="T1TFN2"><p><sup>b</sup>Size exclusion chromatography with neutral pullulans as molecular weight standards.</p></fn><fn id="T1TFN3"><p><sup>c</sup>Sulfate groups per monosaccharide.</p></fn><fn id="T1TFN4"><p><sup>d</sup>The primary OH&#x02013;group in position 6 of PS3 is fully sulfated, whereas the two secondary OH&#x02013;groups in positions 2 and 4 are equally sulfated to about 60% under the used conditions (Yvin et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">2002</xref>; M&#x000e9;nard et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">2004</xref>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Potential cytotoxic effects were checked with LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and MTT assays.

The DC values of PS3 and D.s.-SP were about four times higher than those of UFH reflecting only moderate anticoagulant activity (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>Further, anti-complementary activity was examined by means of complement-induced hemolysis of antibody-sensitized erythrocytes with measurement of the released hemoglobin. All three SP reduced the extent of hemolysis and thus represent inhibitors of the classical pathway of complement activation. But compared with UFH, PS3 was 20 times and D.s.-SP even 224 times more potent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>To screen the inhibitory potency on ECM degradation, enzyme activity assays with two proteases, PMNE and MMP-1, and two glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes, hyaluronidase and heparanase, were performed.</p><p>In the PMNE assay, the activity of the purified enzyme is determined with a synthetic substrate in a buffered system. Here, the equally active PS3 and D.s.-SP are significantly but not much stronger inhibitors than UFH exhibiting a 1.4 times higher activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). Similarly, PS3 is 1.6 times more active than the synthetic inhibitor GW311616A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). The superiority to UFH was confirmed by a fluorimetric assay using FITC-labeled elastin as a substrate (data not shown).</p><p>MMP-1 activity was examined in an assay based on the same principle as the PMNE assay. While the synthetic inhibitor FN-439 reveals inhibitions of up to 90% with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 5.69 &#x000b1; 0.17 &#x003bc;mol/L (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">II</xref>), the SP UFH, PS3, and D.s.-SP show only low maximal inhibitions of less than 50% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A) and higher interassay variations.</p><p>For the determination of inhibitory effects on hyaluronidase, the cleavage of its natural substrate hyaluronic acid was quantified by converting the resulting fragments into colored products. While the potency of PS3 does not significantly differ from that of UFH, D.s.-SP is a 3.3 times stronger inhibitor than UFH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">II</xref>). According to the observed superiority of PS3 to escin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>B), the investigated SP represent by several orders of magnitude stronger hyaluronidase inhibitors.</p><p>In the heparanase assay, PS3 and D.s.-SP cannot be compared with UFH since the latter both inhibits the enzyme and represents a substrate. Consequently, no valid inhibition data for UFH can be obtained. Inversely to the activity against hyaluronidase, PS3 is a stronger heparanase inhibitor than D.s.-SP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>As a simple screening method to assess influences on cell adhesion to <sc>p</sc>-selectin, a static microplate assay was used. Again, both PS3 and D.s.-SP exhibit stronger inhibitory effects than UFH with PS3 being even stronger than D.s-SP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).</p><p>As obvious from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, each of the tested SP has an individual pharmacological profile. In that of UFH, the anticoagulant activity clearly dominates. This is known to be mediated by 30&#x02013;50% of its molecules containing the specific pentasaccharide sequence (Mulloy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">2005</xref>; Alban <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">2008a</xref>) which binds to antithrombin and thus catalyzes the inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa. According to a chromogenic substrate assay on the antithrombin-mediated inhibition of factor Xa, neither D.s.-SP nor PS3 have any antithrombin-mediated activity (data not shown), which explains their moderate anticoagulant activity. But concerning the other activities, they represent generally more or less stronger inhibitors than UFH. D.s.-SP, which has a relatively low degree of sulfation (DS), but a high molecular weight (M<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>), impresses by its inhibitory activity on complement activation and hyaluronidase whereas PS3, the SP with the highest DS and the lowest M<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> of the three examined SP, is the most potent in the cell adhesion and heparanase inhibition assays.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Activities of&#x02009;&#x02009; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="cwn151ilm1.jpg"/></inline-formula> PS3 and &#x022c4; D.s.-SP in relation to UFH.

The results suggest that these two SP exhibit a wide range of biological activities like heparins do (Alban <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">2008b</xref>). However, compared to UFH, their pharmacological profile is clearly shifted in favor of effects that are considered to be important for in vivo anti-inflammatory and antimetastatic activities.</p><p>In this way, our findings exemplarily demonstrate that the activities of SP are not based on unspecific electrostatic interactions with positively charged proteins, but depend on their individual structure. They confirm studies on structure&#x02013;activity relationships of structurally defined semisynthetic glucan sulfates. The latter revealed that important factors for their pharmacological activities are charge density, chain length, as well as the sulfation pattern and the basic polysaccharide structure (Alban and Franz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">2001</xref>; Becker et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">2003</xref>; Fritzsche et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">2006</xref>). Depending on the target, different structural aspects are decisive for the inhibitory potency. Whereas the anticoagulant and PMNE inhibiting activity depend on both DS and M<sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, for inhibition of complement activation and hyaluronidase, a high M<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> is more important than a high DS. Inversely, to inhibit heparanase, a high DS seems to be more important than high M<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> as PS3 is much more potent than D.s.-SP, and also the highly sulfated oligosaccharide mixture PI-88 is a very potent inhibitor of heparanase (Parish et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">2001</xref>).</p><p>In addition, sometimes other structural characteristics than M<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> and DS are crucial for the activity. For example, the anticoagulant activity of heparin is caused by the interaction with antithrombin via a specific pentasaccharide sequence. Further, the anticoagulant activity of D.s.-SP was superior to that of a &#x003ba;-carrageenan with similar DS and M<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> (data not shown). This could be due to the branched structure of D.s.-SP (Gr&#x000fc;newald et&#x000a0;al., in preparation) since branched glucan sulfates showed to be stronger anticoagulants than linear ones with similar DS and M<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> (Alban and Franz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">1994</xref>). Concerning PMNE inhibition, the &#x003b2;-1,3-glucan sulfate PS3 was found to be a more potent inhibitor than pentosan polysulfate (PPS), although this sulfated glucuronoxylan has similar M<sub><italic>r</italic></sub> and DS (Becker et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">2003</xref>).</p><p>These observations agree with the description of cell-surface heparan sulfates as structures specifically interacting with their numerous binding partners by exposing distinct three-dimensional patterns of sulfate substitution (Lindahl et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">1998</xref>; Mulloy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">2005</xref>). Analogously, heparins and SP, which are structurally related to heparan sulfate, may &#x02013; in dependence on their individual structure &#x02013; interfere more or less with processes, where the GAG heparan sulfate or other glycan structures are involved (Alban <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">2008b</xref>). Heparan sulfate shows pronounced structural diversity and has manifold regulatory functions by interactions with a large number of biomolecules such as enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and receptor proteins (Lindahl et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">1998</xref>). In addition, also other GAG and negatively charged glycan structures such as mucins binding to <sc>p</sc>- and <sc>l</sc>-selectin are involved in cell&#x02013;cell and cell&#x02013;matrix interactions (McEver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">1997</xref>). This may partly explain why heparins and SP do not principally display only one specific activity, but rather act as multivalent biomodulators. In this study, we found that PS3 not only inhibits the <sc>p</sc>-selectin-mediated cell adhesion, but also represents a potent heparanase and elastase inhibitor. Although extensive mechanistic studies including experiments with knock-out mice support the relevance of antagonization of <sc>p</sc>-selectin (Alban et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">2008</xref>), the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity may not only be based on this effect.</p><p>Another reason for the multiple activities of heparins and SP is that hemostasis, immune system, and tumor progression including metastasis and angiogenesis represent a (patho)physiological network (Altieri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">1995</xref>; Coussens and Werb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">2002</xref>; Opal and Esmon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">2003</xref>; Bierhaus and Nawroth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">2005</xref>; Polgar et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">2005</xref>; Rak et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">2006</xref>; Buller et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">2007</xref>). They are closely connected by mechanisms which play a role in several of these processes. This can be exemplified by most targets investigated in this study. The ECM-degrading enzymes PMNE, MMP-1, hyaluronidase, and heparanase are expressed by both inflammatory and tumor cells (McCachren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">1991</xref>; Nelson et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">2000</xref>; Parish et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">2001</xref>; Girard et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">2002</xref>; Posey et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">2003</xref>; Taggart et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">2005</xref>; Sato et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">2006</xref>; Vlodavsky et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">2006</xref>). They thus enable these cells to pass basal membranes and/or to migrate through tissues. This is essential for inflammatory cells to extravasate and reach the center of inflammation, but is also important for tumor growth and metastasis. <sc>p</sc>-Selectin, which is expressed by activated endothelial cells and platelets, mediates the rolling of inflammatory cells and thus initiates their extravasation. In addition, it has been recognized to be involved in tumor metastasis (Borsig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">2004</xref>) as well as in hemostasis and vascular pathologies (Andr&#x000e9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">2004</xref>). The complement system, an important part of the innate immune defense, has strong influences on inflammatory processes but also enhances coagulation by activation of platelets, increasing of tissue factor expression in several cell types, etc. which often contributes to life-threatening complications during inflammatory diseases (Markiewski et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">2007</xref>). Interference with any step within this network may therefore be beneficial for the therapy of numerous diseases.</p><p>Although this study focuses on effects in simple in vitro assays, the proven in vivo activities of heparin (Smorenburg and van Noorden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">2001</xref>; Lever and Page <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">2002</xref>; Ludwig et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">2006</xref>; Akl et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">2007</xref>; Lazo-Langner et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">2007</xref>) and PS3 (Yvin et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">2002</xref>; Alban et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">2008</xref>) strengthen the significance of our observations and support the hypothesis that both PS3 and D.s.-SP may have better anti-inflammatory and antimetastatic activities in vivo than heparin. However, there are big differences between the two test compounds. This concerns not only their structural characteristics and their pharmacological profile, but also their origin and consequently the options for potential applications.</p><p>D.s.-SP is a natural product like heparins, fucoidans isolated from brown algae (Berteau and Mulloy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">2003</xref>), or other biologically active algae polysaccharides such as sulfated glucuronogalactans (SGG) isolated from the red alga <italic>Schizymenia dubyi</italic>. The latter were shown to have in vitro effects against several viruses, to inhibit the proliferation of NSCLC-N6 tumor cells and to exhibit anticoagulant and anticomplementary activities (Bourgougnon et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">1994</xref>; Alban et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">1997</xref>). However, the SGG revealed high batch-to-batch variability in both structural parameters and pharmacological activities (Bourgougnon et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">1996</xref>). Also fucoidans vary in both their structural composition and their pharmacological profile depending on their origin (Cumashi et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">2007</xref>). Variability represents a common problem of complex structured SP from natural origin, and is, e.g., the cause why heparins have to be applied in International Units based on their in vitro anticoagulant activity instead of milligrams in clinical practice. It might also be one of the reasons that so far fucoidans have not been tested in clinical studies despite numerous promising pharmacological activities such as anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects as well as anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antiadhesive, and antiviral ones (Berteau and Mulloy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">2003</xref>; Mour&#x000e3;o <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">2004</xref>).</p><p>Although for the production of D.s.-SP only algae from a certain artificial reef are used and D.s.-SP can be obtained in reproducible quality by a specific extraction procedure, it is assumed to be not suitable for drug development, but may be a candidate with good prospects for other applications. Already in 1987, a patent was filed on an emulsion containing 1&#x02013;5% of an aqueous extract of <italic>D. sanguinea</italic>, which has been supposed to improve peripheral blood circulation and to relieve vein complaints (Herve et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">1987</xref>). Recently, a cosmetic composition for the treatment and prevention of skin stretch marks was patented, which contains &#x02013; among other components &#x02013; an extract of <italic>D. sanguinea</italic> (Montanari and Guglielmo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">2008</xref>). Except for the anticoagulant activity of extracts from <italic>D. sanguinea</italic> (Potin et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">1992</xref>), so far no further pharmacological properties are however known justifying these applications. In this study, we identified some effects of D.s.-SP, i.e., a major component of the extracts, which support the intended use. The inhibition of ECM-degrading enzymes and especially hyaluronidase may suit the claimed purposes by reduction of vascular permeability. Interestingly, D.s.-SP turned out to be considerably more active than escin, a known hyaluronidase inhibitor (Facino et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">1995</xref>). Escin is the active ingredient in horse chestnut seed extract, which has been acknowledged as an efficacious treatment for chronic venous insufficiency (Pittler and Ernst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">2006</xref>)</p><p>In contrast to D.s.-SP, PS3 is a structurally well-defined semisynthetic SP, which is produced according to the good manufacturing practice (GMP) guidelines. It can be compared with PPS and PI-88 as examples for other semisynthetic sulfated poly- or oligosaccharides, respectively, and accordingly represents a promising candidate for drug development. PPS is obtained by sulfation of glucuronoxylans extracted from the bark of <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic>. It has been licensed by the FDA for the treatment of interstitial cystitis. Like PS3, PPS has manifold activities which may contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in this indication (Anderson and Perry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">2006</xref>). In Germany, it is approved for oral supporting treatment of peripheral arterial disease, for parenteral postoperative prophylaxis of thromboembolism, and for topic application in diseases like superficial thrombophlebitis. Compared to PPS, the advantage of PS3 is its more homogenous composition and its lower polydispersity. PI-88 is obtained by hydrolysis and sulfation of yeast-derived phosphomannan (Khachigian and Parish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">2004</xref>). It has strong inhibitory potency toward heparanase (Parish et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">2001</xref>) and is being developed as an antiangiogenic anticancer agent (Ferro et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">2007</xref>) with approved clinical effects (Lewis et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">2008</xref>). PPS and PI-88 exemplify the potential of semisynthetic SP like PS3 to be successfully introduced as drugs.</p><p>Examinations of structurally defined SP in a wide range of in vitro assays together with studies on structure&#x02013;activity relationships and in vivo experiments may help to identify those modes of action which are most important for the in vivo anti-inflammatory and/or antimetastatic activity of heparins and other SP.</p><p>Our results suggest that PS3 would be worth being examined in clinical studies as an anti-inflammatory and/or antimetastatic agent. It resulted as the most promising candidate from extensive structure&#x02013;activity relationship studies, has been shown to be active in vivo, is produced under GMP-conditions, and already passed preclinical toxicological tests. But also for D.s.-SP, there might be a perspective of application in cosmetics as an anti-inflammatory agent with potential anti-ageing effects due to inhibition of ECM-degrading enzymes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S4"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S4-1"><title>Test compounds</title><p>Unfractionated heparin (UFH) from porcine mucosal origin (Lot-No 73508019, a purity of &#x02265;99% has been verified by the certificate of analysis by Biochemie GmbH Kundl, Austria) was a kind gift from Novartis (N&#x000fc;rnberg, Germany).
