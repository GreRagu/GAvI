However, while the developmental plasticity of plant cells has been demonstrated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>, it is not known whether the stem cell niche is required for organogenesis. Here we explore the capacity of a broad range of differentiating cells to regenerate an organ without the activity of a stem cell niche. Using a root-tip regeneration system in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to track the molecular and functional recovery of cell fates, we show that re-specification of lost cell identities begins within hours of excision and that the function of specialized cells is restored within one day. Critically, regeneration proceeds in plants with mutations that fail to maintain the stem cell niche. These results show that stem cell-like properties that mediate complete organ regeneration are dispersed in plant meristems and are not restricted to niches, which nonetheless appear necessary for indeterminate growth. This regenerative reprogramming of an entire organ without transition to a stereotypical stem cell environment has intriguing parallels to recent reports of induced transdifferentiation of specific cell types in the adult organs of animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>.</p></abstract><contract-num rid="GM1">R01 GM078279-03||GM</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="GM1">National Institute of General Medical Sciences : NIGMS</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The indeterminate growth of plant organs arises from the activity of a localized stem cell niche, a micro-environment that supports stem cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>. In the plant root, longitudinal cell files converge on a stem cell niche comprised of a set of initials (stem cells) that are maintained in an undifferentiated state by contact with the quiescent centre (QC), a group of cells with low mitotic activity (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). A newly formed QC is detected early after root-tip excision in pea and maize, and after QC laser ablation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which is consistent with the role of the niche as a pattern reorganizer in regeneration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. However, is the reconstitution of the stem cell niche the basis for the plant&#x02019;s high capacity to regenerate? Alternatively, can a wider population of cells exhibit stem cell-like properties regenerating an organ independently of an actively dividing stem cell niche? Here, we address the requirement for stem cell niche activity as a pattern organizer for organ regeneration.</p><p id="P3">To develop a comprehensive analysis of regeneration, we adapted root-tip excision techniques utilized in maize and pea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> to <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> enabling the examination of regeneration with high resolution using confocal imaging of cell-identity marker lines and well characterized mutants with meristematic defects. In combination, we used cell type-specific transcriptional profiles generated previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> in order to track cell identities from microarray analysis of regenerating root tissue at specific time points after excision.</p><p id="P4">We performed standard excisions at 130 &#x003bc;m from the root tip resulting in the complete removal of QC, all surrounding stem cells along with several tiers of daughter cells, and the root cap, including all of the columella and most of the lateral root cap (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>; Methods). The standard excisions were made in a zone of proliferative cells that already express cell-specific markers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>. No hormones or exogenous treatments were applied. Competence to regenerate extended to at least 200 &#x003bc;m from the QC, with the frequency of regeneration dropping sharply at the proximal end of meristematic zone, indicating an extended region of regeneration competence in the root tip (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Cell divisions during regeneration occurred in all major tissues comprising the root tip, as shown by analysis of a cell-cycle marker in five cell types or tissues (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, n=12 roots). In addition, none of the fate-specific markers that we tracked by time-lapse imaging showed expanded expression patterns that could correlate with tissue-specific proliferation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1,2</xref>). Cell division was required, since inhibition of the cell cycle prevented regeneration (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). However, re-patterning during regeneration did not appear to follow a stereotypical sequence of cell divisions, as in embryogenesis or lateral root formation. Taken together, these observations suggest that the meristematic zone as a whole, and not any specific tissue or cell type within it, contributes to root-tip regeneration.</p><p id="P6">To resolve the early timing of cell identity reappearance, we compared global transcriptional analysis of regenerating stumps with an existing library of cell type-specific transcriptional profiles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>. We sampled stumps for microarray analysis at 0 h, 5 h, 13 h, 22 h, and 7 days after initial tip excision at 130 &#x003bc;m (Methods). Using cell type-specific transcriptional analyses of the root, we identified sets of markers that were highly enriched in specific cell types and analyzed their activity during regeneration (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>, Methods). This technique permitted a highly sensitive measure of cell identity since early and late differentiation stage markers could be tracked given about 100 markers for each cell type (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). This global analysis of cell fate showed that molecular recovery of the excised cell identities had begun within five hours after cutting (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). For columella, the percent recovery of enriched markers increased steadily compared to the stump at 0 h, reaching 21% at 5 h, 32% at 13 h and 55% at 22 h (q&#x0003c;5%, Methods), with demonstrated columella differentiation regulators, such as <italic>Auxin Response Factor 10</italic>, induced at these early stages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. About 22% of QC identity recovered at 5 h (q&#x0003c;5%) without any further increase at 13 h and 22 h (q&#x0003c;5%). Thus, we can track the ordered re-establishment of cell identity, which shows the rapid re-specification of lost cell fates and identifies new candidate regulators for specification of cell identity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). These results do not rule out that some QC-specific genes may play a critical role in early regeneration but they raise the question of whether differentiated cell types can be restored before the cell stem niche becomes functional.</p><p id="P7">We established the precise timing of the functional recovery of a completely excised cell type by focusing on columella cells, which reside at the tip of the root. In intact roots, differentiated columella cells accumulate starch within amyloplast organelles, a process required for root gravitropism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>. By one day post cut (dpc), Lugol staining confirmed <italic>de novo</italic> starch accumulation above the cut site (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). More intense staining was observed at 2 dpc (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). To test for recovery of columella function, we subjected regenerating roots to a standard gravitropism assay by reorienting them perpendicularly to the gravity vector and scoring response over time. All wild type roots show a clear gravitropic response within 12 hours. While cut roots did not respond to gravity in the first 12 hours after excision when cut at 130 &#x003bc;m, 13.8% of the cut roots exhibited a clear gravitropic response at 1 dpc, 55.4% at 2 dpc and 89.2% at 3 dpc (n=65, for all time points). However, the QC-specific marker <italic>WOX5</italic> was either ectopically expressed in the endodermal file or, at times, expressed in differentiated columella cells at 1 dpc (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). Thus, as early as one day after complete columella excision, a new set of cells were expressing columella markers and performing columella specific functions while the morphology of the stem cell niche had not yet recovered.</p><p id="P8">Given the early re-establishment of a differentiated cell type, we tested the requirement for functional stem cells by using mutants in which post-embryonic root growth ceases due to the failure to maintain the stem cell niche. The <italic>PLETHORA</italic> (<italic>PLT</italic>) gene family has been shown to be critical for root formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> with the double mutant <italic>plt1plt2</italic> showing differentiation of stem cells at 3 days post germination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> (dpg), as verified under our conditions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, note the lack of stem cell layer between QC and starch-stained columella). The uncut double mutant root has abnormal tip and stem cell niche morphology but normal gravitropism and convergent longitudinal cell files<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>. Surprisingly, <italic>plt1plt2</italic> roots cut at 4 dpg quickly regenerated by re-establishing the U-shaped convergent pattern of longitudinal cell files at the tip (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). Moreover, starch granules accumulated in the regenerating double mutants (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>) and gravitropic response was re-established (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>), indicating that functional columella cells were re-specified during regeneration. Similarly, <italic>scarecrow</italic> (<italic>scr</italic>) mutants, which fail to maintain root stem cell function through a pathway independent of <italic>PLT1</italic> and <italic>PLT2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, were also able to restore their pre-cut pattern, starch staining, and gravitropism (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b&#x02013;d,f</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5b,6</xref>). <italic>PLT1/2</italic> are expressed early in regeneration in wild type roots (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). However, using microarray comparison of <italic>plt1plt2</italic> mutant and wild type roots, we ruled out that <italic>PLT1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>-dependent genes were induced by alternative mechanisms in regenerating double mutants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). We note that a lower percentage of <italic>plt1plt2</italic> and <italic>scr</italic> mutants regenerated compared to wild type roots (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), which we hypothesize is due to the documented effect of both mutants in reducing cell divisions in the meristematic zone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>, the pool of cells recruited for regeneration. Together, these results show that stem cell niche activity is not necessary for early root-tip regeneration and they imply the existence of an independent mechanism for cell-specification and patterning in the meristematic region.</p><p id="P9">Several results suggest that auxin, which has been shown to position the root stem cell niche and to form a potentially instructive concentration gradient<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, may be a critical component of the mechanism that coordinates organogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>. First, roots failed to regenerate beyond the earliest stages when we blocked auxin transport during regeneration using NPA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Second, auxin efflux carriers and an auxin-responsive reporter re-established their excised domains at the root tip within a day of their excision (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a&#x02013;d</xref>). Third, many but not all genes induced in the first 24 h after excision have been shown previously to respond to auxin (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p><p id="P10">If organ regeneration does not require the activity of a stem cell niche, we hypothesized that other determinate organs should be capable of regeneration after excision. We developed a set of markers to distinguish competent <italic>vs</italic>. non competent tissue using transcriptional data on root developmental zones and a time-course induction of pluripotent callus from mature tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Methods</xref>). Intriguingly, many of these markers showed high expression in young <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves (9 days), compared to older leaves (15 and 22 days)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>), indicating that young but not old leaves may be competent to regenerate, as suggested by historic reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>. Consistent with this prediction, we observed leaf regeneration in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> after excising half of the leaf perpendicular to its midvein, in leaves corresponding to young stages (33.3%, n=27) but never in leaves corresponding to older stages (n=10, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b,c</xref>). These observations suggest that the competence to re-pattern complex tissues may be a feature of many differentiating plant cells that share a common set of molecular properties.</p><p id="P11">What distinguishes these regeneration-competent cells from the stereotypical stem cells of the niche?

This suggests that continuous growth may be a unique feature of the stem cell niche while organogenesis is not.</p><p id="P12">The convergence of organ patterning and growth at the stem cell niche of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has made it difficult to separate these two fundamental processes. Taken together, our results separate a widely dispersed capacity for pluripotency and patterning during organogenesis from the narrowly located capacity for indeterminate growth within the stem cell niche. The extension of stem cell-like properties that mediate organogenesis into maturing tissues may predispose the plant for a high capacity to regenerate. Recent work has shown that adult mammalian cells may also be induced to directly switch fates without stem cell intermediates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>. Plants and perhaps other highly regenerative organisms appear to be able to reprogram entire organs in this way. These findings provide a new basis to search for mechanisms that coordinate organogenesis independently of a central organizer.</p><sec sec-type="methods|conclusions" id="S1"><title>METHODS SUMMARY</title><p id="P13">Mutant alleles used were <italic>plt1&#x02013;4 plt2&#x02013;2</italic> (Ws) and <italic>scr-4</italic> (Ws).

Cell type-specific markers sets were generated by identifying transcripts whose signal was significantly enriched in a given cell type compared to all other cell types, using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) with a false discovery rate (q) cut-off &#x0003c; 5%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> and a two-fold enrichment cut off. To increase stringency for cell specificity and assure no overlap between columella and QC markers, we also required a two-fold enrichment in columella average signal over the average signal in each of the other cell types of the root-tip (for example, columella markers were two-fold enriched over QC and lateral root cap, respectively). The same procedure was followed for QC markers, ensuring a two-fold enrichment over columella and lateral root cap. In addition, the root-tip specific cell types also needed to show a two-fold enrichment in root tip over proximal meristem expression.</p><p id="P17">For analysis of percent columella and QC identity recovery, ranked gene expression was tested for a significant fit to modelled expression patterns representing an increase in expression at either 5 h, 13 h, or 22 h using the quantitative test in SAM (q &#x0003c; 5%). For example, genes that increase significantly at the 5 h regeneration time point fit the pattern 1 2 2 2, where 1 represents expression of replicates at time 0 and 2 represents replicates at the subsequent time points of regeneration (5, 13, and 22 h).
