Comparison of the ChIP-chip data and microarray gene expression data revealed that loss and/or gain of H3K4me3 and/or H3K27me3 were strongly associated with differential gene expression, including microRNA expression, between prostate cancer and primary cells. The most common switches were gain or loss of H3K27me3 coupled with low effect on gene expression. The least prevalent switches were between H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 coupled with much higher fractions of activated and silenced genes. Promoter patterns of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 corresponded strongly with coordinated expression changes of regulatory gene modules, such as <italic>HOX</italic> and microRNA genes, and structural gene modules, such as desmosome and gap junction genes.

The proteins that mediate epigenetic changes are involved in dynamic transcriptional control of gene expression and are encoded by more than 100 genes including DNA methyltransferases (<italic>DNMT</italic>s), histone acetyltransferases (<italic>HAT</italic>s), histone deacetylases (<italic>HDAC</italic>s), histone methyltransferases (<italic>HMT</italic>s), histone demethylases (<italic>HDMT</italic>s) and chromatin remodelling enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Miremadi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2), a known core component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is one of the best characterized HMTs, and can trimethylate the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) and thereby repress gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Kirmizis1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous work has shown that EZH2 was significantly upregulated and associated with high proliferation rate and aggressive tumor subgroups in prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Bachmann1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the targets and output of epigenetic regulation in prostate cancer are still not completely understood.</p><p>Genome-wide profiling of the H3K27me3 modification in prostate cancer has been carried out by a few groups. Yu <italic>et al.</italic> have analyzed H3K27me3 location and suggested a polycomb repression signature in metastatic prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Yu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. It would be informative if H3K27me3 locations were also mapped in benign tissues to show the cancer specificity of the signature. Very recently, H3K27me3 modifications were mapped in both prostate cancer and normal cell lines and a set of genes silenced by EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation specifically in prostate cancer was identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Kondo1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Both works shed light on the silencing function of EZH2 in prostate cancer, but little is known about epigenetic gene activation in prostate carcinogenesis.</p><p>To systematically examine the role of epigenetic regulation in prostate cancer, we have screened dysregulated genes in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines using microarray techniques. We found that the most significantly changed epigenetic regulators in both prostate cancer tissues and cell lines were <italic>EZH2</italic>, <italic>SMYD3</italic> and <italic>DNMT3A</italic>, which function as H3K27 trimethyltransferase, H3K4 di/tri-methyltransferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Hamamoto1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and DNA methyltransferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Okano1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, respectively.

To examine the hypothesis that dysregulated genes in prostate cancer contain a distinct pattern of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, ChIP-chip analysis was performed for genome-wide profiling of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modification patterns in both prostate primary cells and cancer cells.

To examine the epigenetic signature of H27K4me3 and H3K4me3 in prostate cancer, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with promoter microarray (chip) analysis was performed for genome-wide profiling of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modification patterns. The prostate cancer cell line PC3 and primary epithelial EP156T cells were selected for profiling because the changed epigenetic gene expression patterns between them were similar to prostate cancer vs benign tissues <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004687-g001">Figure 1</xref>). DNA fragments pulled down by ChIP-grade antibodies against H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were hybridized to Agilent human promoter microarrays which comprise &#x0223c;244,000 60-mer oligonucleotide probes spaced every &#x0223c;195 bp across promoter regions including &#x02212;5.5 Kb upstream and &#x0002b;2.5 Kb downstream of identified transcriptional start sites (TSS).

The majority (71.6&#x00025;) of bivalently H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 and H3K27me3 only (69.3&#x00025;) marked genes differed between EP156T and PC3, while only minor proportions of genes were different within the H3K4me3 and Neither groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004687-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

There were many more repressed genes (4134) than activated genes (2932) according this standard (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004687.s010">Table S9</xref>). Comparing upregulated and downregulated genes in PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004687.s011">Table S10</xref>) with the three subsets, we found that upregulated genes were enriched significantly in the activated subset, while downregulated genes were enriched significantly in the repressed subset (Chi-square test, p&#x0003c;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004687-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Our data indicate that loss or gain of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 is strongly associated with differential gene expression between prostate cancer cells and primary cells.</p><p>We further asked which epigenetic pattern changes that mainly contribute to the up- and downregulation from primary to cancer prostate cells. There are 6 combinations of both repressive and activating changes of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications. For repressive changes: H3K4me3 to H3K27me3 or H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 or Neither; H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 to Neither or H3K27me3; Neither to H3K27me3; for activating changes: H3K27me3 to H3K4me3 or H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 or Neither; Neither to H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 or H3K4me3; H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 to H3K4me3. A comparison of gene expression among these combinations showed that the highest enrichment of differentially expressed genes was associated with the switches between H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. Up to 46.6&#x00025; of H3K27me3 to H3K4me3 genes were upregulated in PC3 cells with extremely low overlap with downregulated genes (0.37&#x00025;), and 36.9&#x00025; of H3K4me3 to H3K27me3 genes were downregulated in PC3 cells with extremely low overlap with upregulated genes (1.8&#x00025;) (Chi-square test, p&#x0003c;0.01), while the lowest enrichment of differentially expressed genes belonged to the switches between H3K27me3 only &#x00026; Neither and H3K4me3 only and H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 (from 8&#x00025; to 13&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004687-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This is consistent with the notion that both H3K27me3 only and Neither are transcriptional silencing marks, and H3K4me3 only and H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 are both activating marks. These findings indicate that the switches between H3K27me3 only and H3K4me3 only play the most important role in differential gene expression between prostate normal and cancer cells.</p><p>A very interesting inverse relationship was observed between enrichment of dysregulated genes and the frequency of the six epigenetic switches in normal and cancer cells. The most frequent switches were associated with the lowest enrichment of up- or downregulated genes between the two cells. The least frequent switches have the highest enrichment of dysregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004687-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). The most frequent switches were between H3K4me3 and H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 and between H3K27me3 and Neither. Both switches included either gain or loss of H3K27me3 (H3K27me3&#x0002b;/&#x02212;), and were associated with low enrichment of changed gene expressions. An intermediate number of epigenetic switches took place between H3K4me3 and Neither and between H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 and H3K27me3. Both were involved in gain or loss of H3K4me3 (H3K4me3&#x0002b;/&#x02212;), but affected gene expression intermediately. The least prevalent epigenetic switches occurred between H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, which were involved in H3K27me3&#x0002b; &#x00026; H3K4me3&#x02212; or H3K4me3&#x0002b; &#x00026; H3K27me3&#x02212;, but were associated with the highest percentage of genes that changed expression. This observation suggested that, from normal cells to cancer cells, the most numerous epigenetic changes were either gain or loss of H3K27me3, but this was associated with the lowest propensity to gene expression changes. The least numerous switches occurred between H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 but most frequently resulted in gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004687-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The interpretation is that the epigenetic marks under study are strongly linked to gene expression changes, but gain or loss of one single marker is usually not sufficient for transcriptional changes. Instead, combinations of changed epigenetic marks, which occur less frequently than changes of single marks, seem necessary in order to achieve threshold values that lead to efficient silencing or activation of genes, possibly by precipitating cascade reactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Genes with Different Epigenetic Modification Patterns were Associated with Distinct Biological Functions</title><p>Gene ontology analysis of genes with different epigenetic modification patterns showed distinct biological functions in EP156T and PC3.

Among these miRNAs, some are highly relevant in cancer, such as miR-205 and miR-200b, which were H3K4me3 marked in EP156T cells and H3K27me3 marked in PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004687-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), and have been reported as suppressors of the transcription factors ZEB1 and SIP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Gregory1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Park1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Downregulation of these miRNAs may be an important step in tumor progression. It is very likely that the epigenetic switch from H3K4me3 to H3K27me3 may be involved in decreased expression of miR-205 and miR-200b, thus increasing the metastatic ability of PC3 cells, a cell line isolated from a bone metastasis of a prostatic adenocarcinoma.</p><fig id="pone-0004687-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004687.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Dysregulated miRNA expression in PC3 Cells and corresponding patterns of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications.</title><p>miRNA genes displayed consistent changes in both expression levels (left) and epigenetic differences (right) between EP156T and PC3 cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004687.g007"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Activated Oncogenes and Repressed Tumor Suppressor Genes in PC3 cells Indicate an H3K4me3/H3K27me3 Signature in Prostate Carcinogenesis</title><p>In cancer cells, activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors represent critical steps at every stage of tumorigenesis. Based on the integration of epigenomic and genomic analysis of prostate cancer and primary cells, we have identified 527 upregulated genes with activated epigenetic modification and 668 downregulated genes with repressed epigenetic modification in PC3 cells. Many activated genes are known oncogenes and the repressed genes are tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004687-g008">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004687.s013">Table S12</xref>).

For most of them this is the first report, to our knowledge, that their dysregulated expression in cancer may be connected to H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 switches. Our present results provide a novel view to understanding the coordinated upregulation of these oncogenes and repression of these tumor suppressor genes in carcinogenesis, thus underscoring the H3K4me3/H3K27me3 signature in prostate carcinogenesis.</p><fig id="pone-0004687-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004687.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Epigenetic Signature in Prostate Cancer.</title><p>A set of well defined carcinogenesis related genes (A) and metastasis related genes showed consistent epigenetic switches and gene expression changes from prostate primary (EP156T) to cancer cells (PC3).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004687.g008"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This work has integrated microarray-based global gene expression and epigenomic profiling of prostate cancer cells and their normal counterparts and found that transcriptional activating marks (gain of H3K4me3 or loss of H3K27me3) and silencing marks (gain of H3K27me3 or loss of H3K4me3) were tightly associated with upregulated and downregulated genes in prostate cancer cells, respectively. The most prevalent switches were gain or loss of H3K27me3 coupled with the lowest enrichment of differentially expressed genes. The least prevalent switches were the ones between H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, but this was coupled with the highest enrichment of dysregulated genes, suggesting that the epigenetic marks under study are strongly linked to gene expression changes, but gain or loss of one single marker is usually not sufficient for transcriptional changes. Instead, combinations of changed epigenetic marks, which occur less frequently than changes of single marks, seem necessary in order to achieve threshold values that lead to efficient silencing or activation of genes. Furthermore, we found that mRNA expression of entire functional modules of genes is coordinated at this epigenetic level. Finally, we identified a set of overexpressed oncogenes with activated epigenetic marks and underexpressed tumor suppressor genes with repressed epigenetic marks in prostate cancer cells, indicating a strong epigenetic signature in prostate carcinogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of genome-wide profiling of the activation marks H3K4me3 and the silencing mark H3K27me3 in both cancer cells and primary cells, and sheds light on the understanding of dynamic epigenetic changes during carcinogenesis.</p><p>The bivalent H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 modification was first observed and proposed to be specific in ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Bernstein1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Further work revealed that it was also present in differentiated cells such as T cells and MEFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Barski1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Roh1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data show that it also can be found in both prostate primary and cancer cells. However, the bivalent H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 seems quite different between ES cells and somatic cells. Firstly, the percentage of H3K27me3 marks colocalizing with H3K4me3 was extremely high (both were 89&#x00025;) in ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Zhao1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Pan1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, but considerably lower in EP156T and PC3 cells (around 50&#x00025;). A similar percentage was observed in T cells (59&#x00025;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Roh1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Secondly, the mRNA expression of bivalently H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 marked genes was very low in ES cells, with only slightly higher expression levels than H3K27me3 only marked genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Zhao1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Pan1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, we found that bivalent H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 marked genes were rather active and only moderately less expressed than H3K4me3 only marked genes in both EP156T and PC3 cells. Again, a similar activity of bivalent H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 marked genes were observed in T cells, in which the percentages of expressed genes were 76&#x00025;, 59&#x00025; and 27&#x00025; regarding H3K4me3 only, bivalent H3K4&#x00026;K27me3 and H3K27me3 only, respectively.</p><p>Very recently, global epigenetic silencing marks in PC3 cells were reported by two groups, and both found that H3K27me3 modified loci excluded DNA hypermethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-Kondo1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-GalYam1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Most interestingly, the increased and decreased DNA methylation regions in <italic>HOX</italic> gene clusters identified by Gal-Yam <italic>et al.</italic> correlated very well with the switched H3K4me3/H3K27me3 regions between EP156T and PC3 cells. The decreased DNA methylation changes of the <italic>HOXB4&#x02013;B6</italic> region, which suggested high H3K27me3 modification at these loci, exhibited high H3K27me3/low H3K4me3 in PC3 cells of our study. In the <italic>HOXC</italic> cluster the other study found increased DNA methylation changes, which suggested none or low H3K27me3 modification at this locus, again supporting our findings of very low H3K27me3 in the whole cluster and high H3K4me3 in the N terminal part of this cluster in PC3 cells. It will be attractive to achieve whole genome mapping of combined DNA methylation, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 marks in both malignant and normal cells to get an even more detailed insight into epigenetic switches during carcinogenesis. Coordinated community based efforts to decode the human epigenome are planned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004687-The1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The emerging picture is that functional groups of genes shift their gene expression patterns during carcinogenesis in association with specific combinations of epigenetic modifications. The cascade nature of epigenetic regulation may cause individual epigenetic modifications to be somewhat redundant as markers of the epigenetic state, and this might facilitate an overall understanding of coordinated regulation of gene expression in cancer and facilitate identification of molecular targets of cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines, Antibodies and Reagents</title><p>The PC3 prostate cancer cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockwell, MD, USA).

Seven replicates of these probes were synthesized in random order on the array together with control probes. Total RNA was purified using the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), the quality control was done with the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, using the RNA 6000 nano kit (Agilent). For each array 1.5 &#x000b5;g total RNA was labeled using the mirVANA&#x02122; miRNA labeling kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Then, samples were hybridized for 16 hours at 42&#x000b0;C on the biochip. During the incubation, samples were slightly moved using Argon pressure. The washing and signal amplification passed according to Febit's standard procedures and criteria. Signal intensities were measured by autoexposure time using a CCD camera. Raw data were further processed by the statistical programming framework R: A background correction was done. The intraarray replicates were merged by computing their mean intensity. Standard quantile normalization was applied to account for interarray effects. Finally, probes that did not show expression (normalized intensity below 500) were removed.

Cells were lysed and the nuclei were sonicated under conditions yielding fragments ranging from 200 bp to 800 bp. Five per cent of the sonicated material was saved as whole-cell extract. Sonicated lysate was divided to three equal volumes and immunoprecipitated with specific or negative antibody bound to protein A magnetic beads (Invitrogen) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with rocking.
