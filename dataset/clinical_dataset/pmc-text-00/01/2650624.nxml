High-density oligonucleotide array-based measurements have further established that many exons are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The mechanisms underlying the tissue-dependent expression of most alternative exons remain, however, to be understood. In this study, we focus on one possible mechanism, namely the coupling of (tissue specific) transcription regulation with alternative splicing. We analyzed the FANTOM3 and H-Invitational datasets of full-length mouse and human cDNAs, respectively, and found that in transcription units with multiple start sites, the inclusion of at least 15% and possibly up to 30% of the &#x02018;cassette&#x02019; exons correlates with the use of specific transcription start sites (TSS). The vast majority of TSS-associated exons are conserved between human and mouse, yet the conservation is weaker when compared with TSS-independent exons. Additionally, the currently available data only support a weak correlation between the probabilities of TSS association of orthologous exons. Our analysis thus suggests frequent coupling of transcriptional and splicing programs, and provides a large dataset of exons on which the molecular basis of this coupling can be further studied.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>transcription initiation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>The most common form of splice variation is the inclusion of an exon in some, but not all, of the transcripts of a gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C2">2</xref></sup> Numerous studies have been dedicated to specific instances of such exons, which are known by various names such as &#x02018;cassette&#x02019;, &#x02018;alternative&#x02019;, &#x02018;skipped&#x02019;, and &#x02018;cryptic&#x02019; exons. The regulatory signals leading to the inclusion or exclusion of a cassette exon also form a vast topic of research. Computational studies are converging toward the view that cassette exons are generally less recognizable to the splicing machinery than constitutive exons due to their shorter length,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C3">3</xref></sup> lower strength of splice sites,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C4">4</xref></sup> and poor representation of general splice enhancers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C5">5</xref></sup> The tissue-specific inclusion of these exons appears to be dependent upon specific regulatory elements, at least some of which are located in the strongly conserved intronic regions that flank the cassette exons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C8">8</xref></sup></p><p>One attractive hypothesis concerning the mechanism of tissue-specific inclusion of cassette exons involves the direct coupling between tissue-dependent transcription and splicing. It has been shown, for instance, that the promoter from which transcription is initiated can affect the inclusion of downstream exons through the recruitment of transcription factors and co-activators that modulate the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C10">10</xref></sup> (kinetic model). In turn, a low polymerase elongation rate can promote the inclusion of some exons that are skipped when the elongation rate is high, as has been shown for the fibronectin EDI exon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C11">11</xref></sup> Alternatively, protein factors that are recruited at the stage of transcription initiation may interact with splicing factors (recruitment model). For instance, the inclusion of the fibronectin EDII exon, normally promoted by the SRp40 protein,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C12">12</xref></sup> is inhibited when transcription is initiated at a promoter containing a binding site for the PPAR&#x003b3; transcription factor. This is because the PPAR&#x003b3; transcription factor recruits an SRp40 inhibitor, the PGC-1 co-activator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C13">13</xref></sup> The role of the promoter architecture on internal splicing has also been demonstrated for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C14">14</xref></sup> and for the steroid-sensitive genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C15">15</xref></sup> Such studies have been limited, however, to very few genes, prompting us to evaluate the extent to which transcriptional and splicing programs appear to be coordinated at the level of the whole transcriptome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2.</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Transcript mapping and splice analysis</title><p>The sequences used in the study consist of the 102 797 Fantom3 mouse cDNAs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C16">16</xref></sup> 52 070 mouse mRNAs from Genbank, and 167 992 human cDNAs from version 3.0 (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.h-invitational.jp/">http://www.h-invitational.jp/</uri>) of the H-Invitational project.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C17">17</xref></sup> We have mapped the mouse cDNAs to the mm7 assembly of the mouse genome and the human cDNAs to the hg18 assembly of the human genome, both available from the University of California at Santa Cruz.</p><p>For the identification of splice variants, we used the automated splicing analysis pipeline that we have previously developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C18">18</xref></sup> Briefly, we first mapped all cDNAs to their respective genome using our spliced alignment algorithm (SPA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C19">19</xref></sup> To avoid biases from transcripts that are badly mapped due to a high rate of sequencing errors or erroneous assembly, we select only those transcripts that have at least 75% of their nucleotides mapped to the genome, with at least 95% identity or less than ten mismatches in each exon. This procedure yielded 132 681 mouse and 110 978 human mapped transcripts, which we clustered such that the mapping of each transcript in a cluster shares at least one exonic nucleotide with at least one other transcript in the cluster.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C20">20</xref></sup> We obtained 42 407 mouse and 22 116 human clusters (transcription units) that we analyzed for splice variation. We were interested only in cassette exons with no other form of splice variation. We identified these as internal exons that were completely contained in an intron implied by the mapping of another transcript in the cluster, having the same splice boundaries in all transcripts in which they were included. Our final mouse dataset consisted of 29 416 transcripts and 4 964 internal cassette exons, and the human dataset of 79 030 transcripts and 11 664 internal cassette exons.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><label>2.2.</label><title>Quantifying the evidence for coupling between the choice of transcription start sites and the inclusion/exclusion of internal exons</title><p>For each transcription unit, we first identified (1) the set of internal cassette exons and (2) the set of transcription start sites (TSSs). The cassette exon annotation was determined as outlined above. To identify different TSSs used within a transcription unit, we had to define precisely what we mean by a unique TSS. The analysis of mammalian TSSs by Carninci et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C21">21</xref></sup> has shown that most TSSs show some amount of variability. Especially at TSSs located in CpG islands, one finds transcripts starting from many different nearby sites covering tens and sometimes hundreds of nucleotides. We, therefore, needed to group transcripts whose apparent start sites were &#x02018;near&#x02019; each other and then identify different TSSs with the different clusters of apparent start sites. We decided to take a conservative approach to this clustering of apparent start sites in a transcription unit by considering all transcripts that started within the same exon to derive from the same TSS. That is, in our analysis different TSSs correspond to <italic>different initial exons</italic> in the transcripts.</p><p>In addition, we tested the validity of our results, on a separate dataset in which we use only transcripts whose initial exons were confirmed by CAGE tag data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C22">22</xref></sup> In the latter case, the initial exon was considered confirmed as a TSS if one or more CAGE tags were found within 100 bp of the start of the exon in the genome. Since the results did not change, and the requirement of CAGE validation of TSSs reduced the size of our data-set significantly, we did not use the CAGE validated TSSs further.</p><p>For each internal cassette exon, we collected all transcripts that could have included the exon as an internal exon, i.e. those transcripts that contained exons both upstream and downstream of the genomic location of the exon in question, and determined the TSS that was used for each of these transcripts. We thus obtained a list of TSSs that were used in the set of transcripts in which the cassette exon could have been included. For further analyses, we kept only cassette exons for which multiple TSSs were identified. We then counted, for each TSS in the list, how many transcripts starting from this TSS included the exon, and how many transcripts excluded the exon. For each internal exon, we thus obtained counts of the number of times each TSS was used in a transcript whose locus covered the exon, and the number of times the exon was included and excluded with each of the TSSs.</p><p>To identify exons whose inclusion depends on which TSS was used, we used a Bayesian model selection procedure that compared the probabilities of the observed counts under a TSS-independent model and a TSS-dependent model.

The exon belongs to the gene aspartate beta hydrolase has a posterior probability of TSS dependency of 0.89, and is indicated in the figure by the thin black rectangle. For clarity, we showed only the transcripts whose genomic loci contain the cassette exon, and we also truncated some of the transcripts after the exon in question. There are three different TSSs upstream of the exon, and a total of 23 transcripts that could have included this exon. Of the 11 transcripts originating in the two upstream TSSs, only one includes the cassette exon. In contrast, nine of the 12 transcripts originating from the third TSS include the cassette exon.</p><p>One may wonder to what extent our results are affected by imperfect efficiency of full length cDNA capture. That is, if a significant fraction of the cDNAs is not full length, the apparent TSSs for these transcripts would be incorrect, and one may wonder how they would influence our results. We have addressed this question by performing the same analysis using only transcripts whose start site was confirmed by CAGE tag data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C22">22</xref></sup> and obtained essentially the same results. However, since requiring additional confirmation of TSSs substantially reduces the sizes of our datasets, we did not use this dataset further.</p><p>It is important to note that we do not need to find the precise locations of the TSSs which may in fact be much less precise than initially thought,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C21">21</xref></sup> but we only need to separate our transcripts into sets that arose from the same transcription initiation regions, controlled by specific sets of regulatory signals. We decided to simply assume that transcripts with the same initial exon arose from the same TSS and that transcripts with different initial exons arose from different TSSs. Two types of errors may occur in this classification. First, transcripts that arose from two different, but nearby TSSs may be assigned to a single common TSS. Second, if a transcript is severely truncated due to cloning or sequencing errors, it may appear to start in an exon which is downstream from its real initial exon. Since the first type of error reduces our ability to distinguish different TSSs, and the second error per definition must be uncorrelated with splicing, the effect of both types of errors will be to <italic>reduce</italic> the correlations between TSS usage and splicing. Therefore, the clear correlations that we observe in spite of these potential errors should be considered to provide a lower bound on the correlations that do exist.</p><p>Another concern may be that the gene structures inferred from full-length cDNA are not representative, because the full-length cDNA sequencing projects generally included a prioritization step, that may have caused an apparent enrichment in rare splice variants. To address this issue, we have constructed a database of splice variants using solely human 5&#x02032;-end ESTs, which we obtained based on the UniGene annotation. We analyzed these data using the same model as we used for full-length cDNAs. The 99% probability interval computed using this dataset was 0.74&#x02013;0.78, compared with 0&#x02013;0.009 obtained using the corresponding randomized dataset. This indicates that TSS-associated splice events are in fact even more frequent than initially estimated from full-length cDNA data. The likely reason why the estimate of the fraction of TSS-associated exons is larger when using 5&#x02032; EST data compared with full-length cDNA data is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSM036F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>. The exon indicated by the box belongs to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic beta subunit (PRKACB), is always skipped when the two upstream promoters are used (136 ESTs), and is generally included with the most downstream promoter (46 of 56 ESTs). These counts are very unlikely under a model in which the promoter usage and exon inclusion are uncoupled. Generally, many exons that in the cDNA data did not have sufficient coverage to allow us to detect their TSS association do have sufficient coverage in the 5&#x02032; EST data to allow this inference to be made, and consequently, the fraction of exons inferred to be TSS associated is larger.</p><fig id="DSM036F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Example of an internal cassette exon whose inclusion is strongly correlated with specific TSSs as inferred from 5&#x02032; EST data.

This could, for instance, manifest itself in a correlation of the posterior probabilities of TSS dependence of orthologous cassette exons. To check this, we started with the human and mouse cassette exons that are part of transcription units with multiple start sites, and we used the UCSC human-to-mouse and mouse-to-human whole-genome alignments to identify orthologous exons (see Section 2.4). This procedure yielded 668 pairs of orthologs. We then computed the correlation coefficient between the posterior probabilities of orthologous exons.

To understand where TSS-associated exons fit in this evolutionary scenario, we analyzed the degree of human&#x02013;mouse conservation of the following categories of exons: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C1">1</xref>) TSS-associated exons&#x02014;those with the top 10% values of posterior probability of TSS association, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C2">2</xref>) TSS-independent exons&#x02014;those with the bottom 10% values of posterior probability of TSS association, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C3">3</xref>) constitutive exons&#x02014;exons included with no variation in more than ten transcripts. For each of these exons, we extracted the mouse&#x02014;human and human&#x02013;mouse alignments from the whole genome alignments provided by the UCSC (see Section 2.4). We then computed the fraction of exons that have orthologs in the other species and the fraction of nucleotides in each exon that are conserved. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="DSM036TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>, we found that the large majority of TSS-associated exons are conserved between mouse and human (438/496 = 88.3% of mouse and 1003/1166 = 86.02% of human TSS-associated exons). Particularly, TSS-associated exons are much more strongly conserved than &#x02018;minor form&#x02019; exons, only 27&#x02013;31% of which having been reported to be conserved between human and rodents,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C23">23</xref></sup> However, TSS-associated exons are significantly less conserved than TSS-independent exons (469/496 = 94.6% in mouse and 1077/1166 = 92.4% in human, P-value of the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test = 6.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> for mouse and 1.12 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> for human). These results are not sensitive to the precise threshold beyond which we consider an exon &#x02018;conserved&#x02019;. Among those TSS-associated exons that do have orthologs, the proportion of conserved nucleotides is lower compared with TSS-independent exons (P-value: 2.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup> for human and 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> for mouse), as well as compared with constitutive exons (P-value of the Wilcoxon test &#x0003c;2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup> for human and 4.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> for mouse). Consistent with previous results relating the degree of evolutionary conservation to the inclusion rate of the exons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C23">23</xref></sup> we found that the overall inclusion rate of TSS-associated exons is lower than the inclusion rate of TSS-independent exons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="DSM036TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Thus, the results suggest that some of the TSS-associated exons are of relatively recent evolutionary origin, and it will be interesting to establish whether the TSSs that promote their inclusion have also undergone recent evolutionary changes. On the other hand, the relatively weak correlation between the probabilities of TSS association of orthologous exons is likely to be in part due to the fact that the human and mouse sequencing projects did not cover sufficiently similar sets of tissues. This would be reflected in different relative usage of the alternative TSSs and exons between human and mouse and these, in turn, would be reflected in disparate probabilities of TSS association of orthologous exons in the two species.</p><table-wrap id="DSM036TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Comparison of TSS associated, TSS independent, and constitutive exons</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data set</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number exons</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">With orthologs</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Median proportion conserved nucleotides</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Inclusion rate</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Proportion symmetrical</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Human exons</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TSS associated</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1166</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1003</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.84</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.75</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.41</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TSS independent</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1166</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1077</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.87</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.86</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.45</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Constitutive</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6377</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6343</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.88</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.38</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mouse exons</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TSS associated</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">496</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">438</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.86</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.75</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.42</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">TSS independent</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">496</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">469</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.88</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.88</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.48</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Constitutive</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5136</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5117</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.87</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Finally, we did not find a consistent trend in the proportion of &#x02018;symmetrical&#x02019; exons, i.e. the proportion of exons whose length is a multiple of three, among our different categories of exons.

One is that tissue-specific transcriptional and splicing events are induced by independent, but tissue-specific transcription and splicing factors. The second mechanism involves a direct influence of tissue-specific transcription factors on internal splicing. We reasoned that if an exon is always included when one TSS is used and always skipped when another TSS is used, yet the two TSSs are both used in the same tissue, then the TSS association may be due to direct coupling of transcription with exon selection. To identify such cases, we used the library annotation of the transcripts in our datasets. We found that for 21% of the human and 14% of the mouse TSS-associated exons the inclusion- and skipping-promoting TSS have been both used in the same tissue.</p><p>One model that has been proposed for the coupling between transcriptional and splicing events is known as the &#x02018;kinetic model&#x02019;,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C10">10</xref></sup> which postulates that cassette exons with weaker splice signals compared with constitutive exons tend to be skipped when the transcript is produced by a fast-elongating polymerase. In contrast, when the polymerase elongation rate is low, the spliceosome has sufficient time to assemble on these cassette exons, which are then spliced into the mature mRNA. We used a web server implementing the Shapiro and Senapathy model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C24">24</xref></sup> (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://ast.bioinfo.tau.ac.il/SpliceSiteFrame.htm">http://ast.bioinfo.tau.ac.il/SpliceSiteFrame.htm</uri>) to evaluate the strength of the splice sites of the cassette exons as well as of the exons flanking them. We found that the strength of the splice sites is comparable between the cassette exons and the exons flanking them (data not shown), suggesting that one of the pre-requisites of the kinetic model (weaker splice sites) is not met by our sets of TSS-associated exons.</p><p>Given that the elongation rate is not homogeneous along a gene, and that promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II is common,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C25">25</xref></sup> we reasoned that the elongation rate of the polymerase may be generally lower at the start of the transcripts, allowing better recognition of cassette exons that are close to the TSS. Therefore, we asked whether the TSS-associated exons tend to be included when the TSS closest to them is used, as this may allow sufficient time for spliceosome assembly. We found this not to be the case: for all TSS-associated exons, we computed the average distance <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> between the exon and the TSSs of transcripts that included the exon, and the average distance <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> between the exon and the TSSs of transcripts that excluded the exon. We then constructed a histogram of the difference <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &#x02212; <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> across cassette exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSM036F6">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>).

We found that approximately the same proportion of TSS-associated exons are preferentially included with the most upstream TSSs as are included with the most downstream TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSM036F6">Fig.&#x000a0;6</xref>). This suggests that proximity to the TSS, which may be indicative of lower polymerase elongation rate, cannot explain the inclusion pattern of TSS-associated cassette exons.</p><fig id="DSM036F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Histogram of the signed difference between the logarithm (base 10) of the average distance to TSS when the exon is included and the average distance to TSS when the exon is skipped.

The correlation may be due to direct coupling between transcription and splicing or indirect coupling, due, for instance, to a tissue-specific signaling pathway that activates both the transcription factors responsible for determining the TSS as well as the splicing factors responsible for the inclusion or exclusion of the cassette exon. Nonetheless, for at least 14&#x02013;21% of the TSS-associated exons, TSSs that are associated with exclusion and TSSs that are associated with inclusion occur <italic>both</italic> in the same tissue, suggesting a more direct connection between the TSS and exon inclusion for at least these exons. The details of the molecular mechanism underlying this dependency remain to be uncovered, and may involve a gene-specific component, as suggested by our observation that some exons are predominantly included when the proximal TSSs are used, while other exons are predominantly skipped. One way of implementing a gene-(and tissue-) specific component could be through dynamic changes in the local chromatin structure that induce in turn local variations in the polymerase elongation rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSM036C26">26</xref></sup> This is a topic for future study and the cassette exons for which we estimated a high probability of TSS association provide good starting points for experimental investigations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary data are available online at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org">www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org</uri>.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This work has been supported in part by the European Network for Alternative Splicing (EURASNET).
