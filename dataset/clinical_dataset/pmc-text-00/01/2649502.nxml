Moreover, directional migration of leukocytes in inflamed &#x0201c;non-lymphatic&#x0201d; tissue is poorly understood. The studying of leukocyte interstitial migration in &#x0201c;non-lymphatic&#x0201d; tissues, however, remains limited because of the induction of diffuse inflammation with &#x0201c;chemotactic chaos&#x0201d; in the interstitial tissue after usage of conventional routes of stimulation such as superfusion or intrascrotal injection of chemoattractants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004693-Mempel1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004693-Wegmann1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004693-Tharp1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Sixty minutes after microinjection of MIP-1&#x003b1;, leukocyte adhesion and transmigration were analyzed.

By contrast, the lowest numbers were measured after microinjection performed at a distance of 175&#x02013;200 &#x000b5;m. Therefore, these data show that for the microinjection of chemoattractants a distance of 25&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;m from the postcapillary venule is optimal, since the inflammatory response is stronger than after microinjections at the two longer distances analyzed. Consequently, microinjection was performed at a distance of 25&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;m from the postcapillary venule under investigation in all further experiments.</p><fig id="pone-0004693-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004693.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Dependency of leukocyte adhesion and transmigration on the distance of microinjection from the vessel.</title><p>Leukocyte adhesion (A) and transmigration (B) were analyzed 60 min after microinjection of MIP-1&#x003b1; performed at distances of 25&#x02013;50, 75&#x02013;100, and 175&#x02013;200 &#x000b5;m from the postcapillary venule.

Alterations of fluorescence intensity of rhodamine 6G were analyzed within a time period of 60 min in three ROIs (100&#x000d7;75 &#x000b5;m): 1) on the vessel side ipsilateral to the microinjection site, 2) on the contralateral side, and 3) at a distance of 350 &#x000b5;m from the venule (considered as background; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004693-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

An assay allowing the analysis of leukocyte chemotaxis <italic>in vivo</italic> in the murine cremaster muscle has been already described in the literature. It is based on the slow release of chemokines from an agarose gel placed on the interstitial tissue adjacent to a postcapillary venule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004693-Hickey1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. A potential disadvantage of this method is that it seems to not consider the distribution of a chemoattractant in the 3D tissue, since the stimulus is applied on the tissue's surface but not in the interstitial milieu. Moreover, although leukocyte chemotaxis towards bacteria <italic>in vitro</italic> and bacterial clearance assays <italic>in vivo</italic> are well described in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004693-Russo1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004693-Heit1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004693-Young1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, there is still no <italic>in vivo</italic> approach allowing the analysis of leukocyte directional interstitial migration towards applied bacteria. As a solution, we suggest here to use perivenular microinjection of relevant chemoattractants or bacteria via a microinjection technique. A similar experimental design was previously used in the cremaster model for local administration of chemokines for studying the mechanisms mediating leukocyte rolling and adhesion <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004693-Ley2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we used perivenular microinjection of chemoattractants or bacteria in order to investigate leukocyte interstitial migration. We assume that microinjection of a chemoattractant or bacteria into the interstitial tissue would establish a chemotactic gradient and mimic the local release of mediators during inflammation. Thus, at begin of the study, we evaluated how a microinjected chemoattractant would be distributed in the tissue after microinjection. For this, the distribution of fluorescent dye rhodamine 6G was analyzed after its microinjection. Analysis of fluorescence intensity showed that the concentration of rhodamine 6G was higher on the ipsilateral side up to 60 min after microinjection. However, it is worth to be noted that the distribution of the fluorescent dye may be different from the tissue distribution of a chemoattractant. Furthermore, in additional experiments, microinjection of MIP-1&#x003b1; was performed at different distances from the venule: 25&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;m, 75&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;m, and 175&#x02013;200 &#x000b5;m. We found that a distance of 25&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;m was optimal for inducing leukocyte migration since microinjections at 75&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;m and 175&#x02013;200 &#x000b5;m initiated less leukocyte adhesion and transmigration. Taken together, these observations suggest that microinjection of MIP-1&#x003b1; generates a stable source of chemoattractant with slow diffusion within the interstitial tissue of the cremaster muscle.</p><p>In a next set of experiments, we applied different chemoattractants (MIP-1&#x003b1; and PAF) and bacteria (<italic>E. coli</italic>) via microinjection and analyzed leukocyte adhesion, transmigration and interstitial migration. First, we found that microinjection of MIP-1&#x003b1;, PAF, or <italic>E. coli</italic> induced a significant increase in leukocyte adhesion, transmigration, and motility of transmigrated leukocytes as compared to microinjection of saline. Second, we compared the character of leukocyte migration after microinjections of chemoattractants or <italic>E. coli</italic> with that induced by intrascrotal injection. Leukocyte adhesion, transmigration, and interstitial migration were evaluated on the vessel side ipsilateral to the microinjection site and compared with those on the contralateral side. As a result, intrascrotal injection of PAF induced diffuse tissue inflammation without any prevalence of leukocyte adhesion or transmigration on either the ipsi- or the contralateral side. Likewise, leukocyte interstitial migration upon intrascrotal injection of PAF displayed a diffuse character as shown by low levels of leukocyte straight-line velocity and directionality on both vessel sides. In contrast, microinjection of MIP-1&#x003b1;, PAF, or <italic>E. coli</italic> induced leukocyte adhesion and transmigration preferentially on the ipsilateral vessel side. Moreover, upon microinjection of chemoattractants or bacteria, leukocyte straight-line velocity and directionality were several times higher on the vessel side ipsilateral to microinjection as compared to those on the contralateral side. In addition, leukocytes moving directly upon microinjection of chemoattractants/bacteria were more polarized as compared to those after intrascrotal injection of PAF. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that microinjection of inflammatory mediators or bacteria induces directional leukocyte migration toward the chemotactic stimuli. Leukocyte motility was comparable in tissues stimulated with MIP-1&#x003b1;, PAF, or <italic>E. coli</italic>. These data support our previous observation that intrascrotal injection or superfusion of these mediators initiates a comparable extent of leukocyte recruitment and transmigration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004693-Reichel1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>How could microinjection of chemoattractants/bacteria induce directional leukocyte migration? On the one hand, chemoattractants administered via microinjection into a perivascular region of the interstitium may diffuse through the extracellular matrix and directly activate the endothelium on the ipsilateral vessel side via G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on endothelial cells. So called &#x02018;interceptors&#x02019; such as DARC (Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines) and D6 have been shown to transport PAF or MIP-1&#x003b1; and present them to the apical side of the endothelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004693-Colditz1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004693-Pruenster1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Alternatively, the endothelium might be stimulated via indirect mechanisms involving the release of mediators derived from cells in the interstitium (e.g., myocytes, fibroblasts, mast cells, smooth muscle cells). Interestingly, glycosaminoglycans have been shown to bind to chemokines and retain them locally in the interstitium, creating a chemotactic gradient and avoiding its rapid distribution in the tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004693-Linhardt1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004693-Middleton1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Next, we addressed the question of whether specific inhibition of Rho kinase with Y27632 would influence leukocyte interstitial migration in our <italic>in vivo</italic> assay.

Oblique illumination was obtained by positioning a mirroring surface (reflector) directly below the specimen and tilting its angle relative to the horizontal plane. The reflector consisted of a round coverglass (thickness 0.19&#x02013;0.22 mm, diameter 11.8 mm) which was coated with aluminum vapor (Freichel, Kaufbeuren, Germany) and brought into direct contact with the overlying specimen. For measurement of centerline blood flow velocity, green fluorescent microspheres (2 &#x000b5;m diameter, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) were injected via an arterial catheter, and their passage through the vessels of interest was recorded using the FITC filter cube under appropriate stroboscopic illumination (exposure 1 ms, cycle time 10 ms, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0004693.e001.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>), integrating video images for sufficient time (&#x0003e;80 ms) to allow for the recording of several images of the same bead on one frame.

Curve-line distance is a total (accumulated) distance presented as a line connecting the position of migrating leukocyte at each time point. Straight-line distance represents the shortest line connecting the start and end point of the leukocyte migration track.
