There exist series of studies supporting the hypothesis that NO may regulate animal or human aqueous humor production. Indeed, in porcine ciliary processes, the site of aqueous humor production, the presence of three NO synthase (NOS) isoforms, namely neuronal NOS (nNOS), or NOS I, macrophagic or inducible NOS (iNOS), or NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), or NOS III, has been identified by immunostaining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, reflecting the biological activity of NOS, NO production could be measured with a porphyrinic NO microsensor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>] applied on the surface of thawed porcine ciliary processes. In similar preparations, when Griess reaction was used to assess nitrite (stable NO metabolite) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], an increased nitrite production was observed when the ciliary processes were exposed to &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists such as isoproterenol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] and norepinephrine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. In addition, in complement to the observation that &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists may promote aqueous humor production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], it has been reported that in a guanylate cyclase-cGMP-protein kinase G-dependent manner, NO stimulates stroma-to-aqueous anionic (possibly Cl<sup>-</sup>) transport that therefore might contribute to an increase in aqueous humor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>].</p><p>In thawed human ciliary processes, NO production could be also detected by a NO microsensor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. However, the expressions of the different NOS isoforms have not been illustrated so far in human ciliary processes/body.</p><p>The &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist brimonidine, a potent ocular hypotensive agent, was found to inhibit the nitrite production increase induced by forskolin (an adenylcyclase activator) through an &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptor/Gi-protein pathway activation in porcine ciliary processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. As in porcine ciliary body again, forskolin up-regulates the protein expression of nNOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. However, whether brimonidine modulates NOS expression in animal or human ciliary processes/body is still unclear.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the mRNA and protein expression of three NOS isoforms in human ciliary bodies in vitro.

For the latter, tissues were placed in a 24-well plate (one half ciliary body ring per well), covered with 1 ml DMEM (Invitrogen) and placed in an incubator (37 &#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>).

By immuno-staining, the existence of three NOS isoforms has been seen in porcine ciliary body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. In the present study, the mRNA as well as the protein expression of three NOS isoforms was detected in human ciliary body. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature about the NOS isoforms mRNA or protein expression in human ciliary body. Although the exact role of nitric oxide production inside the ciliary body is uncertain, the result suggests the possible involvement of NO in physiological and/or pathophysiological processes of the ciliary body, such as aqueous humor production, since NO is highly cell permeable. Indeed, as mentioned before, it has been suggested that NO plays a possible role in aqueous humor production in animal species such as rabbit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>], pig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], and ox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. In pigs, anion (possibly Cl<sup>-</sup>) transport increase is likely to be triggered by NO from the stroma to the aqueous side of the ciliary body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. As it is the case in other tissues such as the salivary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], and respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>], where it has been reported that Cl- transport stimulated by NO is accompanied by fluid secretion, one could speculate that the increase of anion transport in ciliary processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>] may result in an increase of aqueous humor production. Nevertheless, further investigation is still needed to test the hypothesis that NO might modulate aqueous humor formation in human eyes.</p><p>In order to have enough material to conduct experiments (3-4 eyes per experiment), the present study was conducted on human ciliary bodies that underwent a freezing-thawing process. One could therefore argue that this process had, to a certain extent, influenced the nNOS mRNA or protein expression response to the drugs tested. However, in one experiment conducted with a few freshly harvested human ciliary bodies, nNOS mRNA and protein expression also appeared to be up-regulated by 0.1 &#x003bc;M forskolin, an effect that could again be inhibited by 10 &#x003bc;M brimonidine.</p><p>Similar to what had been described in porcine ciliary processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], in human ciliary body, when exposed to the adenylcyclase activator forskolin, both the mRNA and the protein expression of neuronal NOS, but neither of the inducible NOS nor endothelial NOS, were upregulated. As in porcine ciliary processes, predominant distribution of nNOS was noticed along the junction of the apex-connected epithelial bilayers, suggesting the possibility of nNOS to be involved in the aqueous humor production process of porcine eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. On the other hand, iNOS is always activated by cytokines or endotoxins in some pathophysiological processes such as tissue inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Endothelial NOS is stained in the blood vessel network of the ciliary body and is speculated to be involved mainly in the regulation of ciliary circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. It has been reported that cAMP may mediate the pharmacological effect of some &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists to increase aqueous humor production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. The result of the present study indicates the upregulation of nNOS expression by forskolin. Taken together, one can speculate that an activation of nNOS is possibly involved in effect of &#x003b2;-adrenergic agonists in the modulation of aqueous humor formation.</p><p>As a newly developed hypotensive agent, the mechanism of the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist brimonidine on aqueous humor dynamics has not been fully understood. It is reported that through a cAMP-dependent pathway, brimonidine reduces aqueous humor production in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] and rabbit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>] eyes. The present study showns that in human ciliary bodies, brimonidine significantly inhibited the mRNA and protein expression increase of nNOS induced by forskolin. In one additional experiment, in the absence of forskolin, brimonidine decreased the nNOS mRNA and protein expression slightly (although insignificantly) in human ciliary bodies (data not shown). This insignificance in the nNOS expression inhibition might attribute to either a rather small sample size (n=3), or a relative low level of nNOS expression in normal human ciliary bodies, or both. Nevertheless, the result is in line with the observation made in the porcine ciliary processes, showing that brimonidine prevented the nitrite production increase induced by forskolin. Furthermore, the result again suggested the involvement of NOS, at least nNOS, in the mediation of the pharmacological effect of brimonidine in the eye.</p><p>In summary, the present study demonstrated, for the first time, the existence of mRNA and protein expression of three NOS isoforms in human ciliary bodies in vitro. The expression of neuronal NOS was upregulated by the adenylcyclase activator forskolin, an effect that was inhibited by the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist brimonidine. The results suggest a possible involvement of NOS in the mediation of the aqueous humor dynamics modulation by brimonidine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was
