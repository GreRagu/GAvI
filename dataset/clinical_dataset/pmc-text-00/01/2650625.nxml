It is expected that metabolic waste in these cells will be decreased, as fewer dispensable proteins are synthesized. Challenges to reduce the genome size by the stepwise introduction of large-scale deletions have been undertaken for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C5">5</xref></sup> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C7">7</xref></sup></p><p>In a previous study, Posfai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C4">4</xref></sup> reported an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, MDS42, in which &#x0223c;15% of the genome sequence (0.71 Mb) was removed by planned and sequential deletions to eliminate all mobile DNA and cryptic virulence genes. The resultant strain displayed normal cell growth and protein expression comparable with that of the parental strain, MG1655. Interestingly, genome reduction gave rise to unexpected beneficial properties. MDS42 cells exhibit high electroporation efficiency and allow the accurate propagation of plasmids that are unstable in other strains. Another <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, MGF-01, with a 22% genome size reduction (1.03 Mb) was created in Japan using a similar strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C5">5</xref></sup> MGF-01 cells also displayed an unexpected phenotype in that growth was as rapid as the parental W3110 strain in M9 minimal medium during the exponential phase, but continued after the wild-type strain had progressed to the stationary phase. In addition, MGF-01 secreted twice the amount of threonine as the wild-type strain.</p><p><italic>B. subtilis</italic>, one of the most extensively studied model microorganisms, displays superior ability to produce various secretary enzymes. This ability has been widely applied to produce various useful enzymes in the industrial field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C8">8</xref></sup> The 4.2 Mb <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome contains 10 horizontally acquired prophage (SP&#x003b2; and PBSX) and prophage-like (pro1-7 and skin) sequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C9">9</xref></sup> In addition, 2.8% of the genome encompasses two large operons that produce secondary metabolites (<italic>pks</italic> and <italic>pps</italic>). Systematic inactivation of the protein-coding regions revealed that only 271 genes are indispensable for growth in rich medium (LB) at 37&#x000b0;C, as growth is impossible in the absence of these genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C10">10</xref></sup> Westers et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C7">7</xref></sup> reported a <italic>B. subtilis</italic> &#x00394;6 mutant strain with a 7.7% reduction of the genome (0.53 Mb) produced by deleting two prophage (SP&#x003b2;, PBSX), three prophage-like sequences (pro1, pro6, skin), and the <italic>pks</italic> operon. However, phenotypic characterization of the &#x00394;6 cells disclosed no unique properties, including secretion of AmyQ protein, relative to wild-type 168 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C7">7</xref></sup> Our group generated a strain, MGB469, in which all prophage and prophage-like sequences, except pro7, as well as <italic>pks</italic> and <italic>pps</italic> operons, were deleted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C6">6</xref></sup> In this case, cell growth was normal, but no beneficial properties were apparent, including exogenous protein production from the plasmid harboring the corresponding genes. Moreover, we constructed the MG1M strain containing an additional six deletions in the MGB469 genome, resulting in a 0.99 Mb reduction in genome size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C6">6</xref></sup> However, the MG1M strain displayed unstable phenotypes with regard to growth rate, cell morphology, and recombinant protein productivity after successive culture, making it inappropriate for further studies.</p><p>Here, we report the generation of another multiple-deletion series of mutants, from MGB469 as the starting strain through to MGB874 with a total 0.87 Mb genome deletion. When compared with wild-type cells, the regulatory network of gene expression of the mutant strain is reorganized after entry into the transition state due to the synergistic effect of multiple deletions, and productivity of extracellular cellulase and protease from transformed plasmids harboring the corresponding genes is remarkably enhanced.

Next, cDNA fragments were terminally labeled with biotin-ddUTP using a ENZO BioArray Terminal Labeling Kit (Enzo Life Sciences). Hybridization with the oligonucleotide chip was performed for 16 h at 42&#x000b0;C, followed by washing, staining, and scanning using the GeneChip Instrument System, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix).

In total, 74 regions, including prophage, prophage-like, and secondary metabolite-producing sequences, were selected and individually replaced with the tetracycline-resistant gene (<italic>tet</italic>) by selection on LB plates. As a result, we obtained deletion mutants for 63 regions, totaling up to &#x0223c;2 Mb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN002F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A and Supplementary Table S1).

Accordingly, sequential deletions in 11 non-essential gene clusters were introduced in the MGB469 strain to generate MGB874 depleted of 874 kb (20.7%) of the sequence spanning 865 genes from the original <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 168 genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN002F1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A and Supplementary Table S2).

The reduced growth rate indicates that certain non-annotated and deleted genes contribute to the metabolic capacity of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells under normal growth conditions. It is also possible that this phenotype is caused by unexpected synergetic effects of the deletions of annotated genes. Moreover, MGB874 cells did not form spores (data not shown), owing to the deletion of genes essential for spore formation, including <italic>spoIVCB</italic> and <italic>spoIIIC</italic> that encode the N- and C- terminal regions of sporulation-specific sigma factor-K, respectively.</p><fig id="DSN002F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Sequential introduction of large-scale deletions into the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome.

Scatter plots of expression in wild-type 168 and MGB874 cells are presented. Genes deleted in MGB874 were excluded from the analysis. The correlation coefficient is indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="dsn00204"/></fig><p>When nutrients in the culture medium were exhausted, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells entered the transition state, accompanied by various phenomena, such as competence for transformation, secretion of degradative enzymes, and induction of motility through a complex network of global regulators, including ComPA and DegSU two-component systems, the AbrB transition state regulator, and the alternative sigma factor, SigD. Finally, phosphorylation of a two-component regulator, Spo0A, triggers a regulatory program for spore formation involving the activation of an alternative sigma factor, Spo0H, and sporulation-specific sigma factors, SigF and SigG, in prespores and SigE and SigK in mother cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C22">22</xref></sup> A closer examination of the changes in transcriptome profiles associated with entry into the stationary phase, and activation of the sporulation program in MGB874 and wild-type cells disclosed remarkable differences in these processes between the two strains. The ComA regulator that induces competence was activated earlier in MGB874 cells, observed as the expression of the <italic>srf</italic> operon and <italic>pel</italic> gene that are directly stimulated by ComA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C23">23</xref></sup> Moreover, competence genes that are indirectly activated by ComA via the master regulator, ComK, were induced earlier in MGB874 cells, compared with the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN002F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>A). The <italic>degU</italic> regulator participating in competence activation in the non-phosphorylated form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C24">24</xref></sup> and protein production in the highly phosphorylated form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C25">25</xref></sup> was induced earlier and maintained at high levels throughout the culture period in MGB874 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN002F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>B). This altered feature may also contribute to the earlier competence development in MGB874 cells. However, degradative protein production, possibly dependent on DegU, was similar in both MGB874 and wild-type cells, except for major intracellular serine protease (IspA) and bacillopeptidase F (Bpr), which were strongly induced in MGB874 cells at the late growth phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN002F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>B). In contrast, inhibition of the expression of the transition state regulator, AbrB, which represses transition-state genes in the exponential growth phase and is suppressed by phospho-Spo0A,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C22">22</xref></sup> was delayed in MGB874 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN002F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>C). Consistent with this observation, MGB874 cells displayed disrupted expression of SigH, which is repressed by AbrB and activated by phospho-Spo0A. In addition, activation of sporulation-specific sigma factors was delayed in MGB874 cells, as evident from the delay in the expression patterns of genes under their control (except those directed by SigK, which is deleted in MGB874) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN002F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>D). These findings suggest that the transition state is extended in MGB874 cells, compared with the wild-type strain. Furthermore, expression levels of the <italic>ctaABCDEFG</italic> operon encoding cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase and the <italic>atpIBEFHAGDC</italic> operon encoding F<sub>0</sub>F<sub>1</sub>ATP synthase in MGB874 cells were maintained throughout the culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN002F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>E). Interestingly, <italic>appDFABC</italic> and <italic>dppBCDE</italic> encoding ABC transporters for oligopeptide and dipeptide, respectively, <italic>malP</italic> representing maltose-specific PTS enzyme, and <italic>bioWFADB</italic> coding for biotin biosynthesis enzymes were active throughout the culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN002F5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>E). Thus, it appears that metabolic activities are maintained in the extended transition state of MGB874 cells. Global regulators for the transition state influence each other in terms of expression, forming a complex regulatory network. Moreover, activities of ComA, DegU, and Spo0F (phosphorylates Spo0A) are regulated by Rap family proteins to control the precise activation timing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DSN002C22">22</xref></sup> Six <italic>rap</italic> genes among the 11 encoded in the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome were deleted in the MGB874 strain, which may attribute to the disruption of transition state timing and gene expression during sporulation. A significant increase of protein productivity occurred in the deletion process from MGB625 to MGB723 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DSN002F3">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>A). The <italic>rapG</italic> gene and its regulator <italic>phrG</italic> were deleted in this process, suggesting that the deletion of RapG had a major impact on protein productivity among deletions of six rap genes.</p><fig id="DSN002F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Identification of genes with significantly disrupted expression in MGB874 cells, compared with wild-type cells.

It is not clear at the moment that phenomena we observed are due to a global synergistic effect of large-scale genome reduction or mainly due to the deletion of several regulators. Further systematic analysis of changes in the transcriptional regulatory network of MGB874 cells in relation to protein productivity should facilitate the generation of improved <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells as hosts of industrial protein production. We are in the process of introducing further rational deletions on the basis of transcriptome data, gene function information, and comparative genomics, with a view to generating simple, predictable cells comprising genes with defined functions as a new platform of development of bacterial strains for industrial use.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Funding</title><p>This work is part of the subproject &#x02018;Development of a Technology for the Creation of a Host Cell&#x02019; included within the industrial technology project &#x02018;Development of Generic Technology for Production Process Starting Productive Function&#x02019; of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, entrusted by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Japan.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary data are available online at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org">www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org</uri>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="dsn002_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="dsn002_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Shu Ishikawa and Taku Oshima for help in transcriptome analysis and to Junichi Sekiguchi, Kouji Nakamura, and Fujio Kawamura for valuable discussions.
