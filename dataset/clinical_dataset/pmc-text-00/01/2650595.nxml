The survey explores a number of health issues including smoking, exercise, medication use, and palliative care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-copd-3-753">Wilson et al 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-3-753">Currow et al 2004</xref>). It is administered by a commercial research organization with government support. Trained interviewers collect anonymous data from respondents. There is a cost recovery fee charged to researchers for each question included in the survey. Pilot testing of the questionnaire occurs with 50 members of the general public for comprehension and usability prior to administration of each survey annually.</p><sec><title>Sampling schema</title><p>Since the year 2000, a set of core questions have been asked annually about end of life care, with additional questions introduced for a limited number of years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-copd-3-753">Figure 1</xref>). Each year respondents were asked if someone close to them had died of a terminal illness in the last five years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-3-753">Table 1</xref>). Demographic information collected in the survey is about the respondent and limited demographic and medical information about the person who died. Analyses presented here focused on individuals who died from ESLD and their caregivers.</p><p>When respondents reported the death of someone from a terminal illness, information was gathered on the nature of the respondent&#x02019;s relationship to the deceased, their involvement in caregiving, the respondent&#x02019;s perceptions of unmet needs, and the respondents&#x02019; perceptions of level of comfort in the last fortnight of life.</p><p>From September to December 2000&#x02013;2005, 27,100 households were approached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-copd-3-753">Figure 2</xref>). In metropolitan areas, a starting point was randomly selected for each Australian Bureau of Statistics collector&#x02019;s district, and then 10 dwellings randomly selected using a skip pattern of every fourth household. In nonmetropolitan areas, households were selected using 100 starting points statewide; all towns with a population greater than 10,000 were included and towns above 1000 were randomly included. A cluster size of 10 was used at each nonmetropolitan starting point. One interview per household was conducted with the person over the age of 15 who most recently had a birthday. Prompt cards were provided for selected answers to allow categorization of responses. Data were double entered. Missing responses were followed up by telephone. For quality assurance, 10% of each interviewer&#x02019;s respondents were randomly re-contacted to confirm eligibility and responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>South Australia has a population of 1.54 million people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-copd-3-753">Anon 2007</xref>).</p><p>Australia provides free public hospital care for all who elect to use it and universal health care reimbursement for outpatient medical services (Medicare) and for medications (the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme), augmented by co-payments and supplemented by private insurance by a significant proportion of the population.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analyses</title><p>Data were directly standardized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-copd-3-753">Curtin and Klein 1995</xref>) to the 2001 South Australian population by age, gender, geographic profile (rural or metropolitan) and country of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-copd-3-753">Anon 2007</xref>).

One hundred and nine caregivers (109/290; 37.6%) of someone with ESLD indicated that they had unmet needs.

Most frequently identified unmet needs included support with physical care (17%), support with symptom control (11%), better information about the future course of the illness (11%), better information about service availability (11%) and better emotional support for the person who died (11%: respondents could identify more than one unmet need).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients&#x02019; characteristics</title><p>The deceased were an average of 73.9 years old (SD 10.4; median 75.5; range 47&#x02013;92) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-copd-3-753">Table 2</xref>).

As such, it represents a whole-of-population picture of people who have experienced such a death and the sub-group who actually provided care. The cohort identified in this paper also provides key insights into caregiving, the experience of caregivers and the people who died in a way that builds on previous studies that have only accessed participants through hospital records or service attendance.</p><p>The age and marital status of caregivers in this study suggest the next generation are the major caregivers, not spouses despite the focus on them in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-copd-3-753">Bergs 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-copd-3-753">Booth et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-copd-3-753">Bailey 2004</xref>). The distribution of ages reflects broader caregiving literature that no age is exempt from taking on these tasks, even end-of-life care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-copd-3-753">Aldridge and Becker 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-copd-3-753">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-copd-3-753">Levine et al 2005</xref>). The range of respondents&#x02019; ages justifies asking people as young as 15 years of age about their participation in caregiving.</p><p>The demographics of society are moving towards more single occupant households raising questions of the availability of caregivers in the future given the large number of family members who provide care. This becomes an important policy question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-3-753">Aoun et al 2005</xref>). Relatively low levels of perceived unmet needs were identified in this study, considering the enormity of the care being undertaken, and the length of time for which that care was provided. It is not immediately clear why the levels of perceived unmet needs were so low but may reflect the long periods of time (mean 40.1 months, median 21 months) for which care was provided allowing people to mobilize formal and informal support networks to support them well.</p><p>The overall contribution of ESLD to deaths from a terminal illness in this study is very similar to other large studies with this diagnosis accounting for approximately one in ten deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-copd-3-753">Emanuel et al 1999</xref>). The similarity in distribution of causes of such deaths despite differing methods of participant identification (before and after death) adds credibility to these results.</p><sec><title>What are the strengths of the study?</title><p>This study employs a method to identify caregivers at a whole-of-population level that allows investigators to by-pass gate-keeping by medical staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48-copd-3-753">Steinhauser et al 2006</xref>), and also access people who have not utilized tertiary services. By this process, the denominator in the current study is as close to representing the whole population as possible.</p><p>The findings from caregivers about their roles and perceptions of the care they offered and the benefits it delivered to people dying from ESLD is pivotal to the development of social policy. The breadth of sampling across groups often under-identified in health service utilization (lower socioeconomic status, people from culturally and linguistically diverse populations) is a particular strength of this methodology.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations: methods</title><p>Most responses in this study refer to the respondent directly. In one question, caregivers are asked to report on the comfort of the deceased in the last two weeks of life. However, proxy reports have been previously used in similar settings, especially given the difficulty of any assessment in the terminal phases of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-copd-3-753">Addington-Hall and McCarthy 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-copd-3-753">Addington-Hall and McPherson 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-copd-3-753">Tang and McCorkle 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-copd-3-753">Ahmedzai et al 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-3-753">Christianson 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-copd-3-753">Klinkenberg et al 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-copd-3-753">Kutner et al 2006</xref>).

This study covers a large population over five years to minimize variations in perceptions at the time close to the death deliberately. Any recall bias or response shift over time should be equally distributed across the population given its size. Overall, a mean of 27 months suggests a relatively stable pattern of reporting in relation to the death of the care recipient. The stability of data from year to year also gives confidence in the data reported.</p><p>The study stratifies respondents using one aspect of caregiver performance: the time committed to caregiving. Such a process does not encompass other caregiving roles, nor other commitments that caregivers encounter if not only in a caregiving role.</p><p>As a survey focusing on past events, recall of key information is crucial to the validity of the results presented. The role of caregiving is one where issues are going to be potentially life-changing and people&#x02019;s subsequent account of the role may reflect such changes.</p><p>The diagnosis of the cause of death was necessarily broad and as a result is characterised as &#x02018;end-stage lung disease&#x02019;. The flash card had &#x02018;emphysema/lung disease&#x02019; as this reflects terms commonly used in the community by people other than health professionals. It is likely that respondents close to the deceased will be aware of a diagnosis leading to death if it were related to chronic pulmonary disease. Further sub-dividing the diagnosis would lead to a level of uncertainty that would be difficult to defend.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations: sample</title><p>People who live in remote settings, those without caregivers, and people from some cultural backgrounds may not be reflected in these data. People who live alone, or whose caregiver subsequently died (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-3-753">Christakis and Iwashyna 2003</xref>) will need to be studied by other methodologies.</p><p>Key demographic features may change as the result of someone in the household dying: income, place of residence and work status during the caregiving role or after the death of the care recipient.</p><p>Income was the question with the most missing data and therefore needs to be treated cautiously.</p><p>It is likely that certain small communities whose first language was not English were under-represented in the raw data, and this is an ongoing concern not dealt with entirely by using population-standardized weightings for all analyses. Overall, this is still one of the most effective ways to generate a representative sample across the whole population including people from minority groups.</p><p>Despite the period of interest being the last five years the distribution is skewed towards more recent deaths when one would expect that deaths should be distributed evenly across the five-year period. There may be recall error given that life-changing or highly emotional life events may feel more recent than is the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-copd-3-753">Christianson 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-copd-3-753">Addington-Hall and McPherson 2001</xref>). The time since death may also influence the perceptions of the death and issues such as comfort in the last two weeks of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-copd-3-753">McPherson and Addington-Hall 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Generalizability</title><p>Population studies need to be extrapolated with caution to other populations or health and social settings. Given that this study has approached a sizeable population over six years in metropolitan, regional and rural South Australia, it is likely that the findings can be generalised to populations across much of the developed world. The major limit to generalizability is in populations with higher levels of adult smoking or differing occupational exposures that are the most common predispositions to lung disease over the past 40 years, and will only now be reflected in mortality statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>What are the implications for future research?</title><p>Ideally such data could be confirmed with prospective collection in a cohort of people identified as having advancing ESLD. Linking the diagnoses with other co-morbidities would add to the understanding of the total burden of disease experienced by the care recipients. This study has captured perceived needs when subsequently reflecting on those needs. Ideally perceived needs need to be measured while caregivers are actually providing care and again subsequently.</p><p>Ultimately interventions that support caregivers better need to be tested in randomized studies compared to current models of care. Such a study should aim to demonstrate improved perceived support while in the role and better health outcomes after having relinquished the role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-3-753">Christakis and Iwashyna 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-3-753">Aoun et al 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-copd-3-753">Christakis and Allison 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-copd-3-753">Abernethy et al 2008</xref>).</p><p>Given that caregiving roles differ in societies across the world, studies using population-based methodologies should be repeated in different cultures, health and social systems. Results from other methodologies for identifying this cohort of caregivers would allow triangulation of results with this current study.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for practice or policy</title><p>A significant cohort of people who have provided care for a person at the end of life with ESLD and has been identifi ed through this study. Unmet needs are identified, and the length of time for which care is provided raises concerns about the physical and emotional well being of caregivers, considering the demands that are made on them. Ways of better supporting caregivers is a direct challenge for health and social services, especially given the likely symptom burden that people have with ESLD.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ultimately, this study shows that a significant proportion of the population have been affected by the death of someone with ESLD (predominantly COPD) in the recent past, and that many of these people provided care. Meeting unmet needs is an opportunity to improve support for caregivers of people dying from ESLD. How to identify and meet such needs is a specific task of health care providers given the health and social consequences of caregiving.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors declare no competing interests in this work.
