Despite lifelong physiological therapy and antibiotics, the lungs of affected patients are progressively destroyed, leading to respiratory insufficiency. Recessive mutations in <italic>Dynein Axonemal Intermediate chain type 1</italic> (<italic>DNAI1</italic>) gene have been described in 10&#x00025; of cases of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. Our goal was to restore normal ciliary beating in DNAI1&#x02013;deficient human airway epithelial cells. A lentiviral vector based on Simian Immunodeficiency Virus pseudotyped with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Glycoprotein was used to transduce cultured human airway epithelial cells with a cDNA of <italic>DNAI1</italic> driven by the Elongation Factor 1 promoter. Transcription and translation of the transduced gene were tested by RT&#x02013;PCR and western blot, respectively. Human airway epithelial cells that were DNAI1&#x02013;deficient due to compound heterozygous mutations, and consequently had immotile cilia and no outer dynein arm, were transduced by the lentivirus. Cilia beating was recorded and electron microscopy of the cilia was performed. Transcription and translation of the transduced <italic>DNAI1</italic> gene were detected in human cells treated with the lentivirus. In addition, immotile cilia recovered a normal beat and outer dynein arms reappeared. We demonstrated that it is possible to obtain a normalization of ciliary beat frequency of deficient human airway epithelial cells by using a lentivirus to transduce cells with the therapeutic gene. This preliminary step constitutes a conceptual proof that is indispensable in the perspective of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia's <italic>in vivo</italic> gene therapy. This is the first time that recovery of cilia beating is demonstrated in this disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>This manuscript reports on a successful gene therapy attempt on human airway epithelial cells of a patient suffering from Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. In this autosomal recessive disease, cilia of the epithelial cells that border the upper and lower respiratory tracks are not functioning. As a result, patients suffer from recurrent airway infections leading progressively to respiratory insufficiency. There is no treatment as of today that could restore normal ciliary beating. In this report, we showed that it is feasible to transfer a therapeutic gene to human airway epithelial cells with a lentivirus. This transferred gene is transcribed and expressed. Moreover, defective cells that had immotile cilia due to compound heterozygous mutations in the <italic>DNAI1</italic> gene recovered ciliary beating after treatment with a lentivirus containing a normal <italic>DNAI1</italic> gene. This is the first report on gene therapy in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. Since lentivirus is able to insert therapeutic genes into the cell genome, this result may have impact on <italic>in vivo</italic> gene therapy in this disease and in diseases related to human epithelial airway cells such as cystic fibrosis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD, OMIM #242650) is an inherited disease mainly characterized by dysfunction of airways' motile cilia.

Three parameters were investigated: (1) the multiplicity of infection (MOI), (2) the moment of infection and (3) whether using a polycation, Polybrene, or not. Two different moments of infection during Jorissen's culture were tested: at J&#x0002b;1, cells were ciliated and in suspension or at J&#x0002b;3, cells were de-differentiated and adherent. Two days post-infection, reporter gene expression was analyzed by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000422-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In any of the selected conditions, HAECs were transduced but the proportion of transduced cells seemed to be dependant on MOI irrespective of the other parameters, and apparently higher at MOI 75. Then, transduction of cells infected at J&#x0002b;1 seemed more efficient compared to cells infected at J&#x0002b;3. At MOI 75, approximately 38&#x00025; of cells infected at J&#x0002b;1 were transduced versus 20&#x00025; for cells infected at J&#x0002b;3. Moreover, these results seemed to be improved by the use of Polybrene. Finally, at MOI 75, transduction efficiency was quantified at about 38&#x00025; for cells infected at J&#x0002b;1 without Polybrene compared to approximately 50&#x00025; for cells infected at J&#x0002b;1 with the use of Polybrene. These experiments which were not repeated, demonstrated that HAECs could be transduced in a variety of conditions and that J&#x0002b;1 with Polybrene at a MOI of 75 were presumably the best experimental conditions for HAECs infection. Therefore, we selected these conditions for further experiments.</p><fig id="pgen-1000422-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000422.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Transduction efficiency analysis by FACS two days after HAECs infection with pGFP vector.</title><p>MOI, multiplicity of infection (3 values of MOI were tested 7, 35, and 75); J&#x0002b;1, one day after biopsy, ciliated cells in suspension; J&#x0002b;3, three days after biopsy, de-differentiated and adherent cells; &#x0002b;, with use of Polybrene; &#x02212;, without use of Polybrene.

Though, this transduction was only possible from the basolateral surface of polarized HAECs. We did not know whether a Simian Immunodeficiency Virus would transduce although we could foresee that transduction would be more efficient from the basolateral surface of HAECs since it was pseudotyped with VSV-G. We did not know also whether de-differentiated cells would be transduced. It appeared that whatever the conditions used in this study, a certain proportion of cultured HAECs were infected. We then selected the conditions that seemed to provide the higher percentage of infected cells in culture. In any case, these conditions are strikingly different from <italic>in vivo</italic> situation where HAECs are a component of a complex epithelium recovered by a thin layer of mucus. Moreover, Polybrene which seemed to improve viral infection in cultured cells cannot be used <italic>in vivo</italic> due to side-effects. In a next step, we demonstrated transcription and translation of the transduced <italic>DNAI1</italic> cDNA. Finally, we showed that <italic>DNAI1</italic>-mutated HAECs treated by <italic>DNAI1</italic> gene transfer recovered ciliary beating whereas GFP-treated cells' cilia remained immotile, thus supporting our concept that PCD gene therapy was possible using <italic>DNAI1</italic> gene. This conceptual proof is essential in the perspective of a human gene therapy.</p><p>Since it was impossible to obtain a vector containing a conserved Kozak sequence associated with a normal <italic>DNAI1</italic> cDNA sequence, we decided to construct two vectors: one with a modified Kozak sequence upstream a conserved <italic>DNAI1</italic> cDNA sequence (pK-<italic>DNAI1</italic>), and another one with a conserved Kozak sequence but associated with a modified <italic>DNAI1</italic> cDNA sequence (pK&#x0002b;<italic>DNAI1</italic>). However, both vectors turned out to be equally efficient in terms of transcription and translation. Moreover, the addition of a <italic>HA</italic> tag at the 3&#x02032; end did not alter the transcription neither the translation of both vectors. Consequently, we pursued the infection experiments on <italic>DNAI1</italic>-mutated HAECs with the Kozak modified/<italic>DNAI1</italic> conserved pair of vectors (with and without <italic>HA</italic> tag).</p><p>We were unable to detect endogenous DNAI1 protein and DNAI1 HA-tagged protein on Western blot of cultured normal HAECs presumably because the amount of extracted proteins from cultured HAECs was too low. However, translation from the various vectors was confirmed in transfected 293Bosc cells.</p><p>We also failed to label HA-tagged DNAI1 protein in the cilia of infected HAECs. However, the observation of the rescue of ciliary beating after <italic>DNAI1</italic> treatment of <italic>DNAI1</italic>-mutated HAECs with either one of the selected vectors supported the idea that normal DNAI1 proteins, HA-tagged or not, were efficiently localized to cilia. This functional evidence was reinforced by ultrastructural analysis showing an increased number of ODA in axonemes with tagged and untagged DNAI1 proteins. Beside these observations, no difference in the number of IDA was detected between control and <italic>DNAI1</italic>-treated HAECs, in agreement with the knowledge that DNAI1 proteins specifically belong to ODA.</p><p>In <italic>DNAI1</italic>-mutated HAECs treated by <italic>DNAI1</italic>, a partially uncoordinated ciliary beating was observed, probably because as we demonstrated in early experiments, about half of infected cells were not transduced. As a consequence, HAECs aggregates are mosaics composed of cells with immotile cilia and other cells with beating cilia. The number of ODA per axoneme in treated <italic>DNAI1</italic>-mutated HAECs is lower than normal because these values reflected a mix population of HAECs: efficiently transduced cells and untransduced cells, as shown in the bimodal distribution of ODA per axoneme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000422-g006">Figure 6</xref>. In this respect, our results are consistent with the recessive inheritance type of PCD disease for which a normal copy of the <italic>DNAI1</italic> gene is sufficient to an absence of symptoms.</p><p>In order to improve the number of rescued HAECs, we need to improve transduction efficiency, but respiratory epithelium is not exclusively composed of ciliated cells and at least seven other cell types are present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000422-Jeffery1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. To produce viral particles which would preferentially target human airway ciliated cells, the VSV-G large cell tropism protein could be replaced by another envelope protein from one of the various viruses known to infect airway epithelium, ie. coronavirus or Influenza virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000422-Chilvers1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000422-Ibricevic1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Influenza virus receptors, as &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acid receptors, were described to be specifically localized on ciliated airway and type II alveolar epithelial cells in both mouse and human respiratory epithelium, and on a subpopulation of basal cells in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000422-Ibricevic1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid receptors are expressed on human ciliated and goblet cells but not in the mouse. Therefore, it should be interesting to evaluate on our current culture model, the use of hemagglutinin (HA) from selected Influenza viruses which preferentially bind to ciliated cells. Finally, Szecsi <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that HA envelope protein of H7N1 and H5N1 avian viruses was successfully associated with retroviral-based vectors resulting in higher titres of infected cells than with VSV-G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000422-Szecsi1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Airway ciliated cells are differentiated cells which do not proliferate and their cycle life span is supposed to be relatively short.

Nevertheless, Park <italic>et al</italic>. reported that after an injury event, murine ciliated epithelial cells could transdifferentiate into other cell types and restored the airway epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000422-Park1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

Targeting these basal cells with a lentiviral vector would result in the stable integration of the therapeutic gene with no need to repeat infections. The specificity of cells' targeting has been recently improved by taking into account the presence of proteases at the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000422-Szecsi2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, cell transduction can be achieved only in cell types that have the capacity to bind viral surface glycoprotein and to cleave the protease substrate because the surface glycoprotein of several enveloped viruses are expressed as precursor proteins that need to be cleaved into two subunits by cellular proteases to promote cell entry.</p><p>Finally, <italic>DNAI1</italic> gene transfer could be applied to other genes causing PCD, as <italic>DNAH5</italic> mutations are responsible for at least 28&#x00025; of PCD cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000422-Zariwala1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, another vector should be considered for this gene because of size limitation of lentivirus. As an alternative, AAV vectors offer a good safety profile in particular because viral DNA does not integrate into the genome of transfected cells. However, AAV repeated administration triggers anti-viral immune response and its packaging capacity is too limited to hold the <italic>DNAH5</italic> gene (13.9 kb). High-capacity episomal vectors offer the possibility to deliver not only a large gene but also the whole genomic locus including regulatory regions which ensures a physiological expression with tissue and time specificity. However, delivery of extrachromosomal DNA with non viral or viral strategies is so far limited to cell lines. This system, tough, is appropriate for long-term treatment as in PCD because chromosome-based episomal systems contain elements enabling the cell to process episome as an additional chromosome with a mitotic stability &#x0003e;99&#x00025; in cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000422-Lufino1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Patient Data</title><p>The diagnosis of a male patient affected by PCD was based on clinical signs (recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections since early in life, nasal polyps and complete <italic>situs inversus</italic> &#x02013; Kartagener syndrome).
